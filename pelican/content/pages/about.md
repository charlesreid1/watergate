## What is the Watergate Twitter Bot?

The Watergate Twiter Bot (called This Is Watergate) is a robot tweeting fake White House tapes transcripts.
The robot is given a large sample of White House tape transcripts as a corpus of text,
and uses that to learn how to "speak" in the same style, generating random chatter.

If you are not sure what Twitter bots are, read on.

## What is special about This Is Watergate?

The Watergate Tiwtter bot is a robot that creates and publishes tweets.
But the tweets it creates
are randomly generated. It learns how to speak by being given
a large corpus of dialogue,
and constructs new dialogue by repeating and re-using 
language at the phrase level,
instead of the letter- or word-level that is used in a lot of
random text generation algorithms (e.g., the [Markov model of language](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/assignments/markov.html)).
What this allows you to do is generate phony random text 
with the same "look-and-feel" as the original.

Because the Watergate bot takes unaltered sentences straight from the original dialogue,
creating anew by mashing them together in new combinations, 
it presents a very interesting way to experience the history in those White House tape transcripts,
and peek into them in random and often fascinating flashes that 
might otherwise not see the light of day. 

The language the Watergate bot uses is the language of the President 
and the cronies he had surrounding him.
