TRANSCRIPT OF A RECORDING OF A MEETINGBETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND H.R. HALDEMANON MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.13HALDEMAN:Well, the theory, the theory of the Ervinanalysis is that what he's trying to do is goout in a blaze of glory. He wants to, he knowsthat he'll go down hill if he runs any more this (unintelligible). The action he wasafter, cheerfully is once he got interested he,he then began analyzing-PRESIDENT:Just a little (unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Yeah. Precisely.PRESIDENT:Well, uh,HALDEMAN:Yeah. (Unintelligible). **********PRESIDENT:Right. Right. Well, getting back to what wedo here, uh, what, uh, what do you have in mind, uh, the eventual (unintelligible)?HALDEMAN:Well, I think, we, we've gotta lay out the--PRESIDENT:One thing is very, as I told you, is extremelyimportant. We've gotta, we have to (unintelligible) in the sense that (unintelligible) responsibility on, a littlemore on Dean. He's got an office an-all that,uh, and apparently his responsibility on this-HALDEMAN:He can't use the office for most of this. Heuses them to do his other work so that he worksout-they're sort of covering the base andproviding the front for him so that he's -PRESIDENT:Here's the thing, I think, I think-thisconcerns me, Bob. (Unintelligible) from Huntand, uh, then, of course, we're trying tofigure how we're going to cut it out. Why (unintelligible) cut it out without hurting,killing a lot of people. Have trouble(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:That may be what you have to do. PRESIDENT:Now? Well, I don't know. The point is.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.14HALDEMAN:Then Dean, then DeanPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:...his argument is those people are going to bekilled anyway,...PRESIDENT:Well, that's the point. HALDEMAN:...why not kill them with a...PRESIDENT:Dean...HALDEMAN:...clean bullet now? PRESIDENT:...Dean goes... HALDEMAN:And leave the, leave the...PRESIDENT:Dean goes down the line and, and, and then theline is, Oh, (unintelligible). He gets, uh, for example, it appears to me that it's, if youreally want to look at the thing, it's, uh,-Andhe said completely the opposite. He says that he's involved. He, he-and I said why the hell, how, how, how are you involved? He saidbecause he was aware of and participated in theobstruction of justice by reason of the fact that, uh, he was aware of the fact that theywere, uh, they had a fund to take care of thesevarious defendants. I don't believe that that is going to be something that is going to set Dean, myself, you know what I mean. That's,uh, well, when Dean ran the fund to-he didn'thand out the money. Others did.HALDEMAN:We, John and I worked on that with him.Perhaps he thinks I'm tied into that toobecause of this, in a sense, my fund that hewas taking.PRE6IDENT:Yeah. Well, I, I, that's the kind of thing I'dkind of like to get...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.15HALDEMAN:What?PRESIDENT:...out of the way.HALDEMAN:Okay, but, we're very clear on that, exceptthis concern is what they do on the other side. What happened was that is they, they needed the money...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...They were supposed to be getting itthemselves from other sources, from other Cubans and all that kind of crap...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...So, they got back to a crunch once in awhile when a guy had to have another $3,000 or something, or, or he was gonna blow, blow-PRESIDENT:Then, who did it? Dean? That's what worrieshim.HALDEMAN:No. Then what happened was, the only, see theyknew over there that the only money there wasthat was useable was this 350,000.PRESIDENT:Who's they, who's they? HALDEMAN:LaRue and Mitchell.PRESIDENT:Okay.HALDEMAN:And so, Mitchell said, "You've got to use thatmoney." So, I said, "Turn the whole thing back to 'em. We don't want the money anyway. Give just enough, I've been looking for a way to getrid of it." I'll admit I was, I was worriedabout this, this money. I wanted to get it back into the, where it belonged. Uh, so, so,he gave it back to them, and they wouldn'ttake, Mitchell wouldn't let them take it back, but he did say "You've got to use some of it." So Dean told Strachan, who was the guy that hadthe...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.16PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...the physical possession to give X thousanddollars to LaRue. So, Strachan would go andopen his safe, take out X thousand dollars and, and go trudging over to LaRue's, and, and this is all after the election, this is in the-PRESIDENT:After the election?HALDEMAN:Yeah, on the, yeah, and this in- PRESIDENT:Oh, after the election.HALDEMAN:Yeah. And he would go over and give LaRuePRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...X thousand dollars and, and, we cancertainly claim that, that Strachan had noknowledge of what that was for-he was carryingout Dean's instructions; that Dean was carrying out instructions from me; and you've gottaprove it for me. And my point there was, it'stheir money, give it back to 'em, give it all back to 'em. So we were giving-PRESIDENT:The way I would, the way I was going to sayabout it, of course, on the money was(unintelligible). First, what was it? The money was money that was, was collected without regard to the campaign laws at all...HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:...It was in cash. It was for the purpose oftaking polls and surveys, and so forth, prior to that, and so forth...HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:...It was not used .After the election, it wasa surplus...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.17HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:...It was turned back...HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:...Period. Right? HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Now, what happened to it after that? Do wehave to account for what happened to that moneyafter the election?HALDEMAN:Well- PRESIDENT:If it was used to pay campaign bills-HALDEMAN:Yeah. Somebody has t to ~ We don't have to,but the campaign has to...PRESIDENT:Somebody has to what, now? HALDEMAN: ...The campaign has to account for it.PRESIDENT:But it wasn't collected in the cam-HALDE MAN:But they still have to account for-it was, itwas cash on hand at the time of the campaign.No it wasn't" 'cause they got rid of it -(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Not in the campaign, not in the camp- My pointis, I would not treat that, I, that, in my view, wasHALDE MAN:(unintelligible.)PRESIDENT:...not campaign funds. That was campaign- thatwas not given for a campaign at all. Thesewere funds that were, that were, shall we say,collected after the 1968 elections and had nothing to do with any campaign law, was not campaign funds, you know, for, for any purpose.They wanted to know-what did they poll? Theypolled uh, what happened to Goldwater, what happened on the meat prices-MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.18HALDEMAN:Yes sir. Issue, issue polls.PRESIDENT:Issue polls...HALDEMAN:And the...PRESIDENT:...and the rest. The study that you made HALDEMAN:...geographic analysis- PRESIDENT:...and after that they returned it over to theCampaign Committee.HALDEMAN:It was a gift to the Campaign Committee. PRESIDENT:Well I don't, I don't know. Anyway, it's aproblem, and that' se-if Dean sees that, it's aproblem because the question will be asked.Dean is very good this way. You saw how the next question would be, quack, quack, quack, quack.HALDEMAN:Well, it's a potential problem. If, if- Deanis inordinately worried about that problem because it does involve him.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:UhPRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...his view, and we, this is what we weretalking about, I mentioned to you last night onthe phone...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...his view that, putting...PRESIDENT:The White House-HALDEMAN:...the wagons around the White House. AndDean's point is, when you get down to it, the White House literally doesn't have any problemprior to the Watergate break-in. And, in otherwords, there was n-, there was no White House involvement in the Watergate, he's satisfied. That, that-MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9.11 TO 10 35 A.M.19PRESIDENT:Even Colson?HALDE MAN:He's satisfied with that.PRESIDENT:He thinks that telephone call, that's the onewhere...HALDEMAN:You see that's-yeah. PRESIDENT:...Colson has Liddy and Hunt in his office andcalls Magruder and says, "Get off your ass anddo something."HALDEMAN:Well but, but, he argues that, that wasn'tnecessarilyPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and, and probably, and maybe...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...in reality, wasn't knowledgePRESIDENT:I guess, but that-HALDEMAN:...of the operation. PRESIDENT:I, I don't know- HALDEMAN:Now, he did know there was an intelligenceapparatus.PRESIDENT:I recall, (unintelligible) the ITT thing. Ican imagine Chuck and how he was. Hell, he'd go on for an hour about what he was trying todo, like that, and it wasn't like, that he wastrying to get a counter- offensive. I don't know what he was trying to do.HALDE MAN:Yeah. That's when he was playing Teddy Kennedystuff. He was-PRESIDENT:That's right. Damn most (unintelligible).But, uh, well, anyway, I guess that-MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.20HALDEMAN:Dean's point is the only place that the WhiteHouse is culpable.PRESIDENT:Yes.HALDEMAN:...in this thing... PRESIDENT:Uh huh. HALDEMAN:...in any criminal basis.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:...or any real basis... PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...is in the potential charge of obstruction ofjustice after the fact-that we have no problem with the crime itself.PRESIDENT:Right, and on that one he says, why don't wejust say we turned over the money?HALDEMAN:And I don't see why we're even, uh-it, it-so,so the money is used for sue, support stuff for defendantsPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...Why is that obstruction of justice anyway?PRESIDENT:Well, particularly when it's not to sipchampagne. I wouldn't say that, I guess maybe-HALDEMAN:You may not have to get into that at all, see.He's just worried that you might get to it. And, and if you follow his containment line,the odds...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...he feels, and, and I feel strongly on this,are pretty good you won't get into it. He'sjust worried that there's a little lurking some(unintelligible)...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.21PRESIDENT:Possibility (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...because somebody, well, because Hugh Sloanknows that the money was delivered here.That's really where it, what it boils down to.PRESIDENT:Hugh Sloan knows it. HALDEMAN:Or if you put Gordon Strachan...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...up before a Grand Jury... PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...if they ask the right question... Gordonwill never volunteer. He's a lawyer and he's...PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah.HALDEMAN:...smart...PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah. HALDEMAN:...and, he'11 pull- PRESIDENT:But he must not, he must not perjure himself.HALDEMAN:...But, if you get Gordon to a point where theysay, "Was there any money?".PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...somehowPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...he may, they may get him into where- PRESIDENT:But this had already been, some .had been usedyet, is it our money (unintelligible)?MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 AM22HALDEMAN:No. Well, yeah, but never a fund over here...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...only that there - that Stans had this fundin his, in his safe, which he did, which, of course, he would have. He had a cash fund in his, in his safe. It was used for, for variouspayments and that's where-PRESIDENT:As far as this is concerned, this is, is, I'd,I'd say constructively that Stans is clean.Now, to go on to, did you ever sign any(unintelligible)?HALDEMAN:I don't know. I didn't, I never saw him. Inever had a thing to do with the situation.PRESIDENT:There was nothing in writing involved in it.HALDEMAN:Well, Strachan may have had to sign a receiptwhen he took (unintelligible) uh, -PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). HALDE MAN:Well, what it was was that moneyPRESIDENT:I know.HALDEMAN:...that we had left over from '70, 'member wecollected all our cash in '70...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:...And, we told 'em not to spend all of it ifthey didn't have to. We ended up, we had a-and it was probably '68 surplus that we used in '70 and carried over...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...(Unintelligible) of course.PRESIDENT:Why don't we just say on this moneyMARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.23HALDEMAN:The money (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:...Kalmbach's money (unintelligible)...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) Kalmbach.PRESIDENT:...was to be used, this was to be used forvarious candidates but was never used.HALDEMAN:It was to be used for candidate support andresearch.PRESIDENT:For candidate support and research. It wasnever used, turned over to the Committee at the end of the campaign. What they did with it istheir problem.HALDEMAN:That had been collected in years prior to 1971. PRESIDENT:That's right. Very simple. HALDEMAN:Which is true, also. At least that was myunderstanding of that. Now, the problem isthat, I think those funds got mixed together and we never got all the money.PRESIDENT:Really?HALDEMAN:'Cause they told us we couldn'tPRESIDENT:Sure. HALDE MAN:...make a (unintelligible). Uh- PRESIDENT:They didn't use what they thought they did.Anyway, (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) they thought they needed it.It was their point that under the laws there was no way we could, we could use it-which theywere right.PRESIDENT:Which we never did.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.24HALDEMAN:There really wasn&#8482;t. There wasn't even a waywe could use what we had.PRESIDENT:What you, what you mean is that you didn't do athing with the money, which is good.HALDEMAN:See, I had the money, I was going to use it topay for polls (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) you did the polling through,uh,-HALDEMAN:...but they said they had the money to pay forit and they needed, they needed places to showwhere they spend money, so they, so they paid for the bills.PRESIDENT:I would say that looking at the, at the reedthing, now-Ehrlichman, for example, uh, he getsto him, uh,-HALDEMAN:Not on Watergate.PRESIDENT:No, but he gets to him on the, uh, on the, uh,Hunt, if Hunt, with Hunt's, uh,-HALDEMAN:But John doesn't think it does. It gets toKrogh.PRESIDENT:Well, that bothers me.HALDEMAN:It, and it clearly does, then it gets to DavidYoung, and David Young is a weaker reed thanKrogh.PRESIDENT:H-H-Has Young, uh, also lied? They both- HALDEMAN:Well, they haven't gotten to Young yet, I don'tthink. I shouldn't say that 'cause I don'tknow, I don't know.PRESIDENT:But, what were Young and... HALDEMAN:It's my impression that they.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.25PRESIDENT:...what were Young and-Krogh didn't, Krogh hita critical question in his case, apparently,said he didn't know the Cubans(unintelligible). Now how does he get out of that? Has anybody thought of that?HALDEMAN:Well, Ehrlich-, Ehrlichman's view on it is-which kind of surprises me- is to be cold-blooded. Yesterday he said, "When Krogh gets finished with his lying-" he said, "Now I(unintelligible)" They said they know Krogh.PRESIDENT:It's a convicted felon against his word. HALDEMAN:Well, plus, they may not say anything. You,you still-the Cubans seem to be the leastmatter of concern. They're, they're fanaticsand they don't seem to really be too concerned about their pulling the load and their needsare, are fairly minimal, and Dean confirmsagain that Liddy, Liddy is enjoying, Liddy's in jail, he, he didn'tPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...stay out, he, he said, "I want to startserving my term," and he's at, at, uh, Danbury and thoroughly enjoying it. He's a littlestrange.PRESIDENT:That son-of-a-bitch of a judge gave him 35years -HALDEMAN:He may enjoy that. As long as he thinks we'regonna deal something up for him someday when he- it's incredibly- He's got five kids, and all he's concerned about is that there's enough income to take care of his kids and that'sbeing taken care of right now by his father.And his lawyer's got something worked out.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.26PRESIDENT:God damn it, the people are in jail, it's onlyright for people to raise the money for them.I got to let them do that and that's all thereis to it. I think we ought to. There's got to be funds. I'm not being, I don't mean to be blackmailed by Hunt, that goes too far, butwe're taking care of these people that are injail. My God, they did this for-we're sorry for them. We do it out of compassion and Ididn't (unintelligible) the Cuban fund and thepeople that contribute to it didn't have to report on that damn thing. There's no report requirement or any kind of require- meet. Youdon't agree? What else should we do?HALDEMAN:That's why I-it seems to me that there's noreal problem on obstruction of justice as faras Dean's concerned, I mean-it, it doesn't seemto me that we are obstructing justice, for Christ sake. The people-PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDE MAN:...pled guilty...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...when a guy goes and pleads guilty, are youobstructing justice?PRESIDENT:When you help his-HALDEMAN:His argument is, when you read the law, thatthe...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...that, uh-PRESIDENT:Yeah, but, Dean didn't do it. Dean, I don'tthink, I don't think Dean had anything to do with, uh, the obstruction. He didn't deliverthe money or, that's the point. I think whatreally set him off was when, uh, Hunt's lawyer was off at this party and said Hunt needs a$120,000. Well, that was, that was a very,that was a, that was a shot across the bow. You understand, that that would have constituted God-damn blackmail if Dean hadgotten the money and never-You see what I mean?MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.27HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Let's come-to the other... We, when you talkabout the wagons around the White House, Bob,what, what really happens here is that, uh, we really have to take a hard look at the situation and realize that, (unintelligible).I don't think that we can, uh-has anybodycandidly suggested that Magruder was not aware (unintelligible)?HALDEMAN:I don't think so. I don't, I don't, I don'tknow, but I, I have, my opin- I have no knowledge, my opinion is that he knew...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...And, uh, from the way he talks I'm, I'mthoroughly convinced of that. Dean is thoroughly convinced that he knew.PRESIDENT:Always pull through. (Tape noise) It'sMagruder's word against the others and he said he didn't.HALDEMAN:Well, nobody said he did.PRESIDENT:Well, did he (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Oh, yeah, but not-they haven't testified(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Speaking now, speaking now of what Dean tellsme-yes, that's what I'm going to do thisafternoon-and, and Dean tells me things have gotten out of control; and he says well(unintelligible) and asked him how Magruder wasdoing and Dean said Magruder perjured himself. Well, it's pretty rough. I'd say well, with that knowledge can I appoint Magruder to aposition in government? That's the problem,you see (unintelligible).MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.28HALDEMAN:You didn't appoint him to a position in theWhite House.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I hired him out. I'd say...HALDE MANThat's exactly why we didn't let him get intoanything that was a Presidential appointment. And you can also argue that we should have toldthe Secretary of Commerce. On the other hand,we don't, we can't prove he perjured himself, that's Dean's opinion.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Well, Magruder, anyway, that's, we went thatroute for exactly that reason.PRESIDENT:No. No. We didn't.HALDE MAN:But, the other side of that coin is, if you're-unless you decide to throw Magruder to the wolves, you need to keep Magruder on as even akeel as you can. If you decide to throw him tothe wolves, uh, (unintelligible) kind of problem, he's not a guy, he's not a Liddy type. He's exactly the opposite.PRESIDENT:If you decided to throw him to the wolves, whatdoes that (unintelligible)? You wouldn't say anything (unintelligible ) . I mean, the pointis, the point is we say that we have found thatMagruder (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:No. We don't have anybody who can even testifyon Watergate, 'cause we don't have anybody whoknows anything about it.PRESIDENT:Except possibly Colson, and that's just a bigpossibility, possible. Yet, I don't, I don't. I don't agree that nobody else would know.Strachan?MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.29HALDEMAN:Well, that's right. Keep forgetting aboutStrachan. And Gord-uh, what's his name, Deansays he's going to (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:What we do with getting information in sort ofa-he may not have known about how we're-you know what I mean. I think Strachan is, is notthat bad if his fish is gonna get fried. He'sat too low a level. -HALDEMAN:That's a good sign, I know it.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) he got a tremendous amount of-he just got information but he didn't issue orders or anything on what he wanted to do.HALDEMAN:Right. You look at Gordon Strachan. Here's alittle, young lawyer, who used to work for JohnMitchell in his law firm, and came- down to Washington to work in the government, and he'sworking under a campaign with Attorney Generalof the United States is in charge of it. Now, how the hell do you expect him to decide whether something that's being done is right orwrong?PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:I don't know, I don't think,- Gordon doesn't Idon't think, doesn't worry Dean much and hedoesn't worry, I don't, I would not be concerned about Gordon. He is-PRESIDENT:A hell of a guy.HALDEMAN:You never know about anybody. You know, Iwould have never thought that Navy aide would have a nervous breakdown.PRESDENT:Didn't you? (Unintelligible) can sure be wrongin picking people that-HALDEMAN:Uh, Gordon is a guy I wouldn't worry about.But, Magruder is a guy I would. BecauseMagruder is loaded with ego, personal pride,political ambition, uh,...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.30PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...I make it this way: He's had some majorsuccess as a young guy, he's, you know, a, aboy wonder...PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...and, uh, that kind of guy is, uh-,PRESIDENT:How does John answer the Ellsberg thing?That's the other point I wanted to raise, that, uh, John seems to say well,-HALDEMAN:He says, "I didn't know anything about it." He,he says, "I didn't think they, I-"PRESIDENT:Talked about the (Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:No, he didn't. He says he didn't find outabout that.PRESIDENT:Krogh, Krogh did. But, what, what was, whatwere we doing at that meeting (unintelligible) is the whole point (unintelligible)? I'm rather curious to know myself.HALDEMAN:Well, you better ask John, 'cause I don'treally know. All I know is-PRESIDENT:All I know is that, I think it was part of thatwhole operation of John and Young, where wewere just looking into the whole business ofleaks. Henry was in on that. Henry must be aware of some of that. I've got to-HALDEMAN:What they-the enterprise out of there, which isthe key thing-that, that Hunt, you see, Hunt-, what Hunt says is that he'll uncover some of the sleazy work he did for Ehrlichman. He saidparticularly remind him of the...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.31PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...of the...PRESIDENT:That's Ellsberg's affair. That's what Deantold me.HALDEMAN:Alright, and the Ellsberg affair- PRESIDENT:Yeah, what happened?HALDEMAN:I'm not sure what happened, but it hassomething to do with they sent Hunt out, and I guess the CubansPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...to break in...PRESIDENT:To a doctor's office. HALDEMAN:...to a psychiatrist's office to get areport...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...on Ellsberg's mental analysis or somethinglike that, and they bungled, bungled the break- in. They didn't get what they were supposed toget or something, and then they came back andsaid could they go back again and that request got to Ehrlichman, and he said, "Absolutely not," he says. And they didn't, apparently.That's-PRESIDENT:Why did they want a report on (unintelligible)? HALDEMAN:I don't know, but they had-there was a lot ofstuff. They had a lot of interesting stuff onEllsberg that showed he was, that was-we gotsome of it.PRESIDENT:What was the purpose of it though? I mean, todiscredit-7MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.32HALDEMAN:I forgot-Yes. (Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) make a spy out of him, and,uh...PRESIDENT:Oh, I see. HALDEMAN:Uh, uh-PRESIDENT:Did, did, uh, it make him look as bad after allthat national security was involved and so forth?HALDEMAN:Well...PRESIDENT:I'm not sure I (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:And why were we using private people? Becausethe question, there was a valid, or, a real question here as to where the CIA and the FBIfit into it.PRESIDENT:Also, whether they were leaking- HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) because things were leakingfrom all over.PRESIDENT:They were leaking from all over and somebodyhad to find a wayHALDEMAN:And it had to be done independently. PRESIDENT:It had to be done independently because ofpossibility of, uh, leakage.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Huh?HALDEMAN:I don't know whether that'll hold up.(Unintelligible) that doesn't make it legalMARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.33PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) again. If you come back, why-HALDEMAN:That's a long stretched out (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I'm trying to get down to the end of the point,that the man who knows all this is HuntHALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:So, Hunt becomes rather important.HALDEMAN:Probably. PRESIDENT:And Dean's line, Bob, if we want-HALDEMAN:Dean's point on that one is that-PRESIDENT:Dean would say that he'd just cut that off(unintelligible). That's what you really come down to. Or you, you give him $120,000 or atleast give him another contact, you know what Imean? That's, that's a lot of dough. Let's face it, in terms, uh, in terms, uh, of pardon,uh, or so forth, if, if Colson is talking, uh,of a pardon, uh, Christmas, you know, right after the fact that the court, that they're convicted, or either before they're sentenced-he's out of his mind. He knows we can't dothat.HALDEMAN:But if Hunt thinks that's what he's beenpromised...PRESIDENT:He'll shut up now.HALDEMAN:He'll, he may shut up now.PRESIDENT:Yeah, but my point is- HALDEMAN:But, what, what do you do at Christmas time?MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.34PRESIDENT:Yeah. That's right. And the question is, thequestion is that now, it seems to me you'dbetter find out from Colson what he didpromise. (Unintelligible) Don't you think so?HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:But you've got to go about that before he'ssentenced. (tape noise) a pardon. Well, whatthat would be a -HALDEMAN:But not if you get the Parole Board to, uh- Apardon might be, an early pardon, an earlyparole might not, if you get the Parole Board toPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...look at the point that the sentence was,was, uh...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...way out of proportion to the, to the-PRESIDENT:Well, the point is that-Dean says that, that'swhy he's thinking of using Petersen. He says that, and Ehrlichman agrees, that the judge hasthe power to sentence him without parole, andthat's a rough son-of-a-bitch, it seems to me for something like this, on the ground thatthey didn't talk about it, you see. Might makeit tough to, to pardon him. I think it would be curtains for him for that (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:But the point, the moral of it is that hedoesn't - we don't know what Sirica's gonna(unintelligible). Again, Dean looks at the, what might be the worst. It may not be the worst.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Laughter) In fact what usually happens issomething beyond what you thought was the worst.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.35PRESIDENT:Well, on the wagons theory, uh, what, what,what does that mean, I wonder, to put thewagons up around the White House. I mean that-who do you let down the tube? Do you let Magruder down?HALDEMAN:You don't intentionally, you leave Magruder-what you do is, is you, see, we&#8482;re, we're doingstuff now. We're keeping quiet and, and, uh, all that...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...just try and cov-and, and putting up thismoney and, and everything else. We're trying to keep-when you get right down to it, as Deansays-the only White House guilt, culpability,is in the cover-up...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and what, what's the purpose of the cover-up, to protect the White House? No, it protects some individuals of the Committee.PRESIDENT:Mitchell, Magruder.HALDEMAN:And the question then is how, what individuals,how far up does it go, that you're protecting? And we've already, we're not protecting Liddy,so we, we (unintelligible) so, we got to talkto him. Uh, the question is, can it, can, if you, you could-his idea is you separate, you look at the Committee as one thing, the WhiteHouse as another.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:The White House has no guilt in the Watergatething.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:So, you come up with wagons around the WhiteHouse, and you just, you just turn it up, you,you do whatever you do, issueMARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 to 10:35 A.M.36HALDEMAN:statements, issue a new statement, well,(CONT.)well, whatever, to totally cut off the WhiteHouse from the, from the, the whole Watergatebusiness. Now, at the same time you do that, it might be, we haven't gotten to this, but, it might be, you also have to do the Segrettithing and, to a degree, implicate the WhiteHouse, which is...PRESIDENT:That's HALDEMAN:...fine. There must be a decent statement(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I, I don't, uh, I don't know how you feel aboutthat.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...or a statement, or a-HALDEMAN:There has to be something. That's right. PRESIDENT:Or do you agree? HALDEMAN:Uh, no, I think you do, I think they do.PRESIDENT:I think we need, uh, I mean, let me say, let meput it, I have a certain balance (unintelligible) that Dean's statement, or theMoore's statement, or what have you, sure will(unintelligible) and so forth, but it's better to have something rather than nothing. You know what I mean?HALDEMAN:Well, but then the questions that that raisesare- they can successfully do that, but, can you, are you any better off if the White House is clean but your Campaign Committee's dirty,or if, if, if we cut the whole thing off.PRESIDENT:That's not what I was referring to.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 to 10:35 A.M.37 (Repl. 10/28/74)HALDEMAN:In other words, we need (unintelligible) theCampaign Committee and (unintelligible) theWhite House. First of all is that believable?Uh, happens to be true, but can it be convincing? Uh, uh-PRESIDENT:Well, that, well, they, what you're -HALDEMAN:And Dean-if they get, if they get as high asMagruder, probably it doesn't hurt too much. If they get to MitchellPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...uh, he's awfully close to you. PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:He's not as close to you as Ehrlichman and, Iguess, that Dean and Haldeman now, which(unintelligible). Mitchell will find a way out. You have to let them get to him, I think.But, Dean's thought, I think what convinced himto put the wagons around the White House is that it forces Mitchell to take the responsibility rather than allowing Mitchell tohide under the blanket of the White House,which he's been doing, and I think Dean feels that that's - And, and in a way, it does Colsontoo, uh, who's out. He feels that, thatMitchell and Colson can take care of themselves.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:I don't know. But the, the, the problem isMagruder can't take care of himself, exceptwith this straight line- his, his present, uh, position. . .MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.38PRESIDENT:Yep.HALDEMAN:...and see whether he can, can make it stick.Now, they may be able to hang him on thatPRESIDENT:They'll kill him. HALDEMAN:...but still, it will get to, to a question.They may be able to indict him if they getother people to talk, but can they, can they-PRESIDENT:They'll convict him. HALDEMAN:...beyond a reasonable doubt? Maybe not, if,if he stays with his line, they may not be ableto convict him. Then Magruder indicted and winning, uh, acquittal, may be a pretty good route for us to go. We won't know unless wetry. And they're, what'll you do if they callus? We can't not go there again. And if I were the prosecutor, well, that decision, it'sthe Justice Department that prosecutes that, somaybe we can control the prosecution and not call 'em.PRESIDENT:WellHALDEMAN:But there again, at least if you call us, we'reunder rules of evidence and, andPRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...oh, and germaneness.PRESIDENT:You've got lawyers who object, you can go torelevancy there.HALDEMAN:Yeah, and they can only PRESIDENT:Go to relevancy, that's no problem there.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.39HALDEMAN:So they can't go fishing. And there is noproblem, unless they get to Strachan and maybestart running that stream.PRESIDENT:Another thought that has been raised is theidea that (unintelligible) things going wrong (unintelligible) a Special Counselor.HALDEMAN:I don't know, not, not being a lawyer, I(unintelligible) this kind of stuff, but, uh, Dean feels very strongly, and John Ehrlichmanseems to concur, that it would, that we do needthe advice of somebody who knows more about the criminal set-up than we do...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and they-PRESIDENT:We, can't go to Petersen- HALDEMAN:Well, they don't know Petersen's the guy. Theywonder if, you know, what we got into lastnight after we were in here, was the question of whether, I guess it was Dean, could call Petersen and just say we need advice. Can Italk to you on a, on a totally confidentialbasis, outside of school, and it will (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:You wouldn't do that, uh, through Kleindienst?HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:Kleindienst wouldn't (unintelligible) after youtold him? I'm just, just asking.HALDEMAN:I don't know. That, that, the way that we weretalking, it's going...PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...to have to either be, uh...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.40PRESIDENT:Right. Okay.HALDEMAN:...just straight bilateralPRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...Dean to Petersen PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...or Dean would just say I'm over, I'm over myhead on this...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...and, uh, I need counsel on an informal andtotally confidential basis. Will you sit downand let me go through this with you? But it'dhave, would have to be understood and it might- I recognize that you may be-can't do it becauseas the head of the Criminal Division it putsyou on the other side. It can't be separated. Dean has the feeling that the more Petersen knows, the more helpful he can be, and that hewill be.PRESIDENT:I'm not sure that that's what you can count on. HALDEMAN:I'm sure you can't count on it, becausePetersen's another human being, too.PRESIDENT:And he's a knowledgeable man. (Unintelligible)you stuck somebody (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:But you don't know what his ambitions are and,uh-PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) and I just don't know.HALDEMAN:Well, I know they're all possibilities, butapparently, all the way through this he's been a very solid rock.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.41PRESIDENT:(unintelligible) - problems?HALDEMAN:The problem you got with Petersen is that hewants to go out in private practice withKleindienst.PRESIDENT:Well, I'd sooner take (unintelligible) HALDEMAN:And if you didn'tPRESIDENT:What are you (unintelligible), tell Kleindiensttoo?HALDEMAN:I don't think that, if you're going to do this,you can't do it without Kleindienst knowing.PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:And I think here you just gotta(Unintelligible).REEL TWO BEGINS PRESIDENT:Unintelligible). I, I, I'll just call him andsay (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...Well, he used to, and I assume that that(Unintelligible) same ones, I think.**********PRESIDENT:Does Dean have his report from Sullivan?HALDEMAN:Yeah. END OF REEL ONE HALDEMAN:Uh, uh, he does.PRESIDENT:Not very good?HALDEMAN:Oh, it's gotta-it's some of mostly the same oldstuff. It's the Anderson and all, uh, crap,and, uh, uh-da, well there is, there's onething that we could build up that would, that I think we could get built up that would be pretty good, which is about the extensive useof the FBI in the 1960, or 4, DemocraticConvention and an attempt to use them in '68. There is also some cover-up on Walter Jenkins,and some instructions by Johnson to the FBI asto what they were to find when they were making this investigation and, uh-uh, I don't think we can use that, I mean, it isn't, that isn't--
