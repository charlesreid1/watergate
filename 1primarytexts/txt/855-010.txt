(Noise)COLSON:Yes, sir. I think I've just been-- packingand, uh, getting briefed...PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah. COLSON:...by the State Department. PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:I've finished up my office work.'PRESIDENT:Well, I think when you're there -- now, thething to do is to try to put out of yourmind all of the problems in which I--You gotto fish these things out--We always do. We (unintelligible)-- Watergate and all that sort of thing--is going to be, be there.It's gonna be (unintelligible) for what itis. And I think that you gotta take, take periods like this, (unintelligible)--three weeksCOLSON:I-I'll be off and it'll be about threeweeks.PRESIDENT:Good. Just get out there and don't read anypapers, and---COLSON:Well, (unintelligible) PRESIDENT:I think, (unintelligible) COLSON:It's, uh--PRESIDENT:The only paper I--left is basically theWashington Post, as far as I can see. Damn, it&#8482;s worse than the Washington Post.I--characterize the Post, the Times--The NewYork Times.FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM2COLSON:Yeah, they take the worse of each. it'suh--PRESIDENT:Awful.COLSON:Terrible. PRESIDENT:In legal terms it's (unintelligible) thewall. Alright.COLSON:Well, I, I very much appreciate your-- PRESIDENT:Yeah. What are your (Clears throat) lastminute assessment of the Watergate thing andso forth? What's going to happen on, ah?COLSON:Well, I had a long talk-- PRESIDENT:They sentenced this (unintelligible).COLSON:I had a long talk with Bob about ityesterday, Mr. President---PRESIDENT:(unintelligible) COLSON:Af-after we talked--and now I met lastevening for a couple of hours with DavidShapiro. He's a--apart from being a splendid (unintelligible) and, uh, smart--and he, he gave me a ra-- rationalewhich he's writing up for john Dean--forinvoking Executive Privilege for all but certain defined areas where individualwrongdoing might be involved. He believeswe're on very, very solid ground if that's the course we want to take.PRESIDENT:Um hmm.FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM3COLSON:His analysis of it is that if you can't havea confidential--the President cannot haveimmediate advisors and a confidentialrelationship unless he is assured that that confidentiality can be preserved, likealaw clerk, with a, with a judge orCongressional aide, and, uh--PRESIDENT:Mmm hrm. COLSON:Itmakes a very, very good case, uh, and,and expresses it very articulately. Italked to Fielding, who is Dean's assistant, this morning and told him that Shapiro wouldcomein and work with him next week it he is--this week if you want to. I think it's the only course to takeI mean it, you, you uh--PRESIDENT:Start breaking over and (unintelligible).The problem is that, I guess (Noise) (unintelligible) the precedents are so so important is the break over on Flanigan andjustified that.COLSON:Well, Plana--no--Flanigan we did just that.We said that, that it was a privilegedrelationship, uh, separation of powers,weargued. However, uh, we would voluntarily make it available for a restricted area negotiated in advance. And, uh--PRESIDENT:Well, I expect some additional area--COLSON:That's what we do this thing with. And,uh--PRESIDENT:Oh yeah.COLSON:And, uh PRESIDENT:We shouldn't have Haldeman testify?FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM4COLSON:Well, I, I told Bob yesterday, I thoughtperhaps Bob should not at all, uh--PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:Ehrlichman, MacGregor and myself, Timmons--only as the clearly defined areas in which--where we waive, waiver (noise)--we waive theprivilege basically.PRESIDENT:Yeah. COLSON:On any matters that have already--we'vealready been questioned by the FBI.PRESIDENT:The part that I think is this--the part I'mconcerned about is--you got to figure whichis worse--to, uh, waive the privilege inthis (unintelligible), or just, uh, and people say, "Well, they stonewall it." I knew this--that the charge of cover up andinnuendo of charges that we've done- it allof--are worse then what comes out. Ya know, I think you've got to realize that--I got--I always go back at first to my--my--ownexperience in the Hiss case. The Hiss caseof course, the the ad-administration was doubly guilty at -first, uh, he was guilty.But second, what really creamed him wasthat, the charge the administration was trying to cover it up. (Unintelligible) Justice Department did, uh, drop the caseafter they--after we got the facts fromthem. He was a red herring Was not knowing all these facts of course-- and we killedit--it was the cover-up that hurt, not thefact that Hiss was guilty. (Unintelligible).COLSON:It's--of course this instance isdistinguishable in that you have had a veryexhaustive investigation. No one can reallyuncover, uh--FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM5PRESIDENT:True. ButCOLSON:What, whatPRESIDENT:When they say the investigation--you seethat, Chuck, when I asked for the investigation was not being involved and itwas covered up. No, no, I don't think wehave a choice, uh, decision. But that's my point. I, uh, that's why I don't want to give any indication that we're afraid of,uh, anything that's the point. I, I thinkit should be extremely limited though. I don't want to see you down there(unintelligible) you know what I mean. Theyget you into other offenses...COLSON:Nothing to do with this. That's the pointShapiro made that I thought was mostperceptive. He said, "Where you havealready testified to a Grand Jury or to the FBI..."PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:"...in that area you have already exerciseda waiver, beyond that, no.&#64258; Now, if you do that that's fine, of course(unintelligible). If I had Dean on thewitness stand and I, uh, wanted to create a headline a day, I could, I could ask about when one of the milk producers first cameinto--(Noise)PRESIDENT:Yeah, I know-- COLSON:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:...or...COLSON:Nothing to do with Watergate, nothing to dowith, uh, Segretti. I never heard of him, uh, but you could go on a fishingexpedition.FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM6PRESIDENT:The thing is th (unintelligible)COLSON:Yeah.PRESIDENT:They just--that's something we just can'tget into.COLSON:Well, you're--PRESIDENT:Today as for example, too, like, like astory Colson this morning commented that Liddy had the--, the FBI Internal Security taps. But I can't believe that's true. Imean, I, uh, I don't know what they'retalking about.COLSON:I, uh, that could have been true. They,they had that security unit set up in thebasement of the EOB which Bud Krogh ran.PRESIDENT:Oh, I see, they were, at that time, in thecountry--COLSON:Oh sure. And they were, that was perfectlylegitimate. I mean that's, that's the kind of thing they were hired to do...PRESIDENT:Mmm hmm.COLSON:Uh, investigating the authenticity of...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) COLSON:...of the Dita Beard letter was was aperfectly legitimate thing. And, uh, I toldthe FBI about that--there wasn't anything to hide. Uh, the thing you can't do is you can't get part way pregnant. You can'tstart talking about one aspect of arelationship...PRESIDENT:Yeah.FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM7COLSON:...with, with a White House employee and notanother...PRESIDENT:What is--what does Shapiro think? I meanhe--COLSON:Shapiro believes that if Mitchell was indeedresponsible that he should step forward nowand take the heat, and uhPRESIDENT:Not go to jail? He can't do that? COLSON:Well, his point is he's going to anyway. Uh,Shapiro's point is if, if he was guilty andif it's going to come out in the hearings, uh, then don't let it come out in thehearings, take our own losses ourselves.PRESIDENT:Well, that's, that's very nice(unintelligible)COLSON:It depends on what, what, uh, what- Johnknew. I don't know what he knew, uh...PRESIDENT:Well&#352; COLSON:...first hand-- PRESIDENT:Right. Did he, did he, uh (unintelligible)he knew he was-aware of Hunt and all thatsort of thing, is that correct? Is that what's gonna come out? That hasn't yet.COLSON:That hasn't yet. That's right. But ya see,John doesn't have any privilege. John doesn't have any, uh...PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:...an immediate relationship to you. Uh,uh, he was a...PRESIDENT:off--COLSON:...Cabinet officer and he had--did have...FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM8PRESIDENT:I was talking about the campaign.COLSON:So, he doesn't...(Noise)PRESIDENT:Nothing about his campaign (unintelligible)COLSON:Shapiro's only analysis, just as a coldblooded analytical lawyer--if you're gonna,if you're gonna have a big explosion onnational television and let goddamn Magruder--PRESIDENT:Magruder. Those are the two, I guess, thatare really a problem.COLSON:You'd have the same problem, of course if,if he knew about it.PRESIDENT:Oh, he did--COLSON:I'm sure he did. PRESIDENT:He had to know about it. COLSON:I know he did.PRESIDENT:How about Mitchell? Do you think he is?COLSON:John is--John has the most marvelous-- PRESIDENT:Great stone face. COLSON:Yeah. And convenient memory. I mean, hecan--PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah. But the point is(unintelligible) or not, you, you, mean thatthis, this concern about Hunt cracking whichyou expressed, uh, incorrect? I suppose as the uh, the judge calls him in--do you think that Hunt might just say, "Well, I'll tellmy whole story." My view is that he won'ttell the whole story. My view is that he'd say, "Alright I will tell what it is.&#64258; But,the, uh,--that what he would dc frankly iswould be to tell that Mitchell, Mitchell--Do,you think that's what he would tell them?FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM9COLSON:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:Or Magruder.COLSON:Well, I don't...PRESIDENT:My view is that he would limit the losses.He wouldn't go all the way.COLSON:No. He would limit the losses.PRESIDENT:I don't think he would come in and say,"Well I worked here for Colson on the Dita Beard thing and I worked on this, that andthe other thing.&#64258; Or would he?COLSON:No. Be-because there isn't anything that,thatPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) the judge doesn't need toget into that.COLSON:There's noth-nothing to do with Watergate. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) held say (unintelligible)about Watergate (unintelligible).COLSON:He might do that, uh, I don't think so. Butuh, normally I wouldn't question Howard Hunt. Normally--PRESIDENT:No. I don't think he'll (unintelligible)problem.COLSON:But he's just too--PRESIDENT:Just too much.COLSON:Yeah. It's a tough one, it's a really toughone.PRESIDENT:Mmmm.COLSON:Uh, I don't think he'll crack. But, but I,but who knows. I mean, how do you know what goes through the minds of anybody in asituation like this.FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM10PRESIDENT:Right.COLSON:God only knows.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) It's very tough. Ya seethese blacks for example (unintelligible) None of these guys had weapons did they?COLSON:No.PRESIDENT:Gee COLSON:Ya know that's the--of course that's the-- PRESIDENT:Burglars without weapons.COLSON:That's the travesty of the whole damn thing,I suppose. No one was hurt. It was a stupid thing--dumb. But, my God, it isn't,it isn't like the Hiss trial. It isn't likethe (unintelligible). There's no...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). I know that. COLSON:In terms of the...PRESIDENT:(unintelligible)COLSON:...consequences publicly it's justpreposterous--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) because that, uh, Hiss wasa traitor -- it was a cover-up.COLSON:Yeah. PRESIDENT:A cover-up is, is the main ingredient.COLSON:That's the problem--PRESIDENT:That's where we gotta cut our losses. Mylosses are to be cut. The President's losses got to be cut on the cover-up deal.FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM11COLSON:Right.PRESIDENT:Not the merits of the thing, Christ:I Ipled the merits all the way up. I said,"Well, they did it and it was wrong." Period.COLSON:Mmm.PRESIDENT:But, uh, as far as this (unintelligible)we&#8482;re not covering up a damn thing.COLSON:Hell! We're not covering up anyPRESIDENT:The problem with Magruder is, is thatbasically he's so close to Bob. Do you think that's what it is? I suppose theyfigured if Magruder would mention Haldeman(unintelligible). Correct? Is that where you think (unintelligible)trail leads?COLSON:That's what they would assume, but--I mean,that's what some people would assume, but Idon't, I think he was divorced publicly well enough in advance of all of this stuff that, uhPRESIDENT:Well, he's not--Bob had no contact with, uh,with Hunt. Did he--COLSON:No.PRESIDENT:...or McCord?COLSON:No. PRESIDENT:...or Liddy?FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM12COLSON:No. I don't believe so. Oh, hell no. Idon't think that's--PRESIDENT:His contact was with Magruder, correct?COLSON:Yeah. Or through Gordon Strachan, which wasthe other link thatPRESIDENT:Well--COLSON:That they would draw. But, Bob was in adifferent position. Bob is--is so much an extension of you. I mean, his every day,his, his day's workPRESIDENT:I'm talking a-, I'm talking about hisprivilege. I'm talking about, uh, talkingabout what could come out on him and, uhCOLSON:The only thing that could come out isprobably that, they ya know, they those people over there were crazy with memoranda.They wrote everything down. Uh&#352;er...PRESIDENT:Everytime Bob called (unintelligible). COLSON:Sure. (Noise) Sure. Or people would usehis name. I mean, that happens to me, thathappens to Ehrlichman--PRESIDENT:Yeah. COLSON:And that's another problem, you, y-y-youcan't control who says, "Well..."PRESIDENT:"Colson wants this done."FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM13COLSON:&#64257;...Colson wants this done.&#64258; And, uh,either that, I just--somebody just...PRESIDENT:Well, they (unintelligible). They even usethe, uh, they say "The President wants this or that done." Of course they, they have --the boss wantsthis or that done and soforth. And of course (unintelligible) most people (unintelligible)COLSON:Ya. I never did that deliberately. Eh, butthat's-- but a lot of people do do that, ofcourse.PRESIDENT:Well, fortunately, I didn't see any of them,ya know as far as my, my situation here isextremely qood. I never talked to--I, I divorced myself from the tactics of the campaign.COLSON:Yeah. Very good.PRESIDENT:Except my own schedule. COLSON:Very wise. PRESIDENT:I wouldn't let people come in and talkpolitics. Mitchell didn't. That was allMagruder (unintelligible) B-But never saw Magruder until after the NovemberCOLSON:Huh.PRESIDENT:Never saw him. No, they never told methey'd been o-over there and met all those quys at the (unintelligible) and MacGregor.(unintelligible) that's good too.COLSON:Oh, no. I think I, I think the only, theonly pitfall, Mr. Presidentand this isthe one that I',ve--I think I've got everybody-- I think everybody's thinking on the right line. The only pitfall is the moment you open up the Pandora's box in the WhiteHouse you can lead into nineteen othertotally irrelevant (unintelligible with noise) are the ones that would cause dailyembarrassment. My feeling is hard line it,in terms of what you are willing...FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM14PRESIDENT:Right.COLSON:...to talk about.PRESIDENT:You know the thing about it of course isthat you have this enormous differ-difficult double, double standard in the press, forinstance. You can take this story abouttoday about the--that they had access to the confidential memoranda. Now, who the hell is that coming from, I ask ya? See they gotthis and they're dripping it up little bylittle. Who--where are they getting these stories, Chuck?COLSON:Bureau.PRESIDIENTThe FBI? COLSON:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Did they question the FBI (unintelligible)how did the FBI know?COLSON:Well, the FBI would have been in a-wouldhave been sending that information over to Liddy and Hunt.PRESIDENT:Mmm hmm.COLSON:And, uh, every leak we've had, Mr.President, has been out of the Bureau, uh,that's one of the reasons that when youasked me my opinion yesterday, I, I don't know whether--PRESIDENT:About Gray.COLSON:I don't know whether Gray's the best man ornot, but I--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)COLSON:Yes, certainly. Let him go in and fire someof the bastards that he thinks have, have uh, (unintelligible)--PRESIDENT:Yeah.FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM15COLSON:The whole damn--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) on the other hand they goout (unintelligible). What then?COLSON:Well, the hell, they're talking now. If--there isn't anything that I ever told theBureau that I haven't seen come out inprint. And, uh, it does, it really does raise questions about the integrity of the Bureau's process. You have to be a littlecareful what you--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). Well, when Hoover wasthere it didn't leak.COLSON:It didn't happen?PRESIDENT:Did not happen. COLSON:Oh, hell no. They were scared stiff. PRESIDENT:I, I could talk to Hoover about all sorts ofthings and I talked to him very freely overthe years and there it never, never came out.COLSON:Well, because they knew that if any bodytalked--PRESIDENT:To the press. COLSON:to them. And, uh--PRESIDENT:You take, you take the (unintelligible) makea smart thing, big thing out of some contribution we received that would sort of (unintelligible) more than a five thousanddollar contribution. You know that wasn'treally a blunder. Was it? Good God! When our people spent thirty-four million dollarswhere the hell (unintelligible).FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM16COLSON:Not only that they, he, he wrote off allthe, all the loans which which was a--adirect avoidance of the statute and, uh we-PRESIDENT:Not an evasion. COLSON:Sir?PRESIDENT:Not an evasion.COLSON:Not an evasion. PRESIDENT:Not a--not a-not a violation, therefore. COLSON:No, but my God, I mean if you're gonna, ifyou're gonna write it on something uh&#352;so theSeafarers gave us--Paul Hall gave us a hundred thousand dollars. Well,that's-They've, they've written about thatnow four days in a row. But, uh, Kimmelman writer, off a half a million and uh, which was an avoidance, uhPRESIDENT:You mean he loaned that much for a-- oh, forChrist's sake that's a--our people are gonna make anything out of it?COLSON:Oh, we explained about it. We explainedabout it during the campaign. But, uh--PRESIDENT:So it's a contribution? COLSON:Sir? They carried it as a loan all throughthe campaign because they didn't want toshow this big sum of money coming from these people.PRESIDENT:Oh.FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM17COLSON:After the election they'd write off theloan. So it becomes a contributionabsolute.PRESIDENT:Wouldn't our counsel get into that hearing? COLSON:Oh, absolutely, absolutely.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) on that.COLSON:That's the kind of thing that, uh, where yaknow--if, if our fund raising and money is being held up to inspection, uh, his shouldbe--same way.PRESIDENT:(unintelligible) did you do this, did you? COLSON:Oh, I'd call on every one of those guys.Uh, can have a parade if, if that's the waythey want to play the game, then they've got to know--the people on the Hill have got to know that's the way our guys are gonna playthe game-uh, which I think they would.(Pause) But, but, the bottom line, Mr. President, of all of this, really, is that I just don't think the public gives a damn.Now they--everybody enjoys a sideshow andthis town gets all excited over the--that kind of circus.PRESIDENT:I agree--true.COLSON:But I think you just have to go up thereand, and, and say the matter of principle that, uh, and, and be very hard about it,and then say, "What the hell, if thecountry..."PRESIDENT:Right.COLSON:You're gonna, you're gonna get the, the Leftall exercised. Because it's something they can (unintelligible)FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM18PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)COLSON:I just don't think the man in the streetcares.PRESIDENT:Right, right, right. COLSON:The people that I have talked to the lastforty-eight hours have--just have oneoverwhelming sentiment and that is &#64257;My God, how proud they are to be Americans, how proud they are of you.&#64258; Uh, everybody--it's, it's been an interesting phenomena.Everyone I've talked to has said, "Congratulate the President on theprisoners.&#64258; And that just--the impact ofthat is, is, uh, the equivalent of a thousand Watergates. He just--PRESIDENT:You know, even though it's a symbolic thing(unintelligible) flag (unintelligible)COLSON:Beautiful statement. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) COLSON:The Washington Post buried it(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:They did it because they just, they know itwas a very (unintelligible). The averageperson (unintelligible)COLSON:Oh, absolutely, absolutely. No. I, Uh-- PRESIDENT:Yes. (Unintelligible) COLSON:Yeah, but your statement was marvelous. It'sthe time to fly the, to fly the flag high.FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM19(PRIVILEGED MATERIAL DELETED)PRESIDENT:0h, I see. Don't read the papers. Forgetthe whole damn thing. Let her go.COLSON:Well, we'll, uh, we'll tough it(unintelligible) throuqh and, uh, come outon top as we always have.PRESIDENT:I mean, this is a tough one, because there'sso many players, and so God-damn sad I think of those seven guy...COLSON:So do I.PRESIDENT:...who are involved, you know, Jesus Christ,they did it with good intentions(unintelligible). Of course, I guess they,they must have known that they had to take this kind of risk (unintelligible)COLSON:I think that they've taken that all theirlives. I don't think that's --PRESIDENT:Yeah. They've been talking, they've beendoing this sort of thing--COLSON:Yeah, I think, they got&#352;well--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)COLSON:RESTRICTED-&#64257;B&#64258;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)COLSON:Mr. President I thank you for your(unintelligible)FEBRUARY 14, 1973, FROM 10:13 TO 10:49 AM20PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) this trip (unintelligible)fine, fine. You just go ahead--COLSONWithout---PRESIDENT:Have a good time. COLSON:I'll be winding up when I get back. I don'twant to be maudlin but it was kind of ironicwith Christmas coming up.PRESIDENT:Well, said that to Ziegler, forgive me forHelms being sent to Ghana.COLSON:(Unintelligible). Proudest thing I've everdone in my life, sir,PRESIDENT:Well, that's uh--you're not leaving, you'rejust going across the street.COLSON:(Unintelligible)...block away- I, uh-- PRESIDENT:Right.
