TRANSCRIPT OF A RECORDING OF A MEETINGAMONG THE PRESIDENT, H.R. HALDEMAN,AND JOHN EHRLICHMAN, ON APRIL 14, 1973,AT 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.**********Part I(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:All finished?EHRLICHMAN:Yes sir. All finished. He is an innocentman in his heart, and in his mind, and he does not intend to move off that position.He appreciated the message of, that, uh,good feeling between you and him.PRESIDENT:He got it, that, huh?EHRLICHMAN:And he appreciated my --PRESIDENT:Why don't you give me your, uh -- How didyou, uh, get this little chapter and verse - -.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I started out by saying that this wasa subject that was so difficult for you to talk to him personally about, that you had asked me to do this.PRESIDENT:And that you had made a study --EHRLICHMAN:...that you had had me doing this. That Ihad presented you with a set of conclusionsthat were admittedly hearsay, but thatpointed in the direction of, uh, the, uh, of his exposure, and Jeb's, and other people, and that you were having me systematicallytalk to these people because, in the courseof this investigation, we had discovered a frame of mind on the part of some peoplethat they should stand mute in order to helpthe President, and that your sense was that the Presidency was not helped by that, and that it was not my purpose to tell anybodywhat he should do, but only to tell him thatas far as your view of the interests of the Presidency were concerned, that they werenot served by a person standing mute, forthat only, for that reason alone. Now,there might be plenty of reasons why aperson would want to stand mute and put thegovernment on its proof. And that wasn't the question. And obviously he, and then he said, "Well, what you're saying to me isthat the President is reserving to me all myoptions," and I said, "Of course he is, John. The only thing that he doesn't wantyou to feel is that you don't have theoption of going in and talking, if you want to do so. That you have completely every option to go in or not to go in." And hesaid, well he appreciated that, but he hadnot been taking the position he had for the reason that he thought he was necessarilyhelping or hurting the Presidency, but hesaid, "You know, these, these characters pulled this thing off without my knowledge." He said, "I never saw Liddy for months at atime." And he said, "I didn't know whatthey were up to." And he said, "Nobody was more surprised than I was. We had this meeting, and, and," uh, he, he lobbed, uh,mud balls at the White House at everyopportunity -- it was very interesting how he dragged it in, uh, yeah...UNIDENTIFIEDEHRLICHMAN:...one after the other. But for instance,he said, uh, "There were these meetings, uh, uh, these characters came over to my officeand, uh, Liddy put on this million dollarpresentation which was perfectly ridiculous. Says it comes --the origin of that, ofcourse, was in the White House where BobHaldeman and I talked about something called the Operation Sandwedge. That was really the grandfather of this whole thing. And,of course, that was never put togetherbecause we couldn't get the right people to do it, and -- They were talking about JoeHoods and people of that kind," and so hesaid "It never happened."PRESIDENT:What is Operation Sandwedge? HALDEMAN:It's, it was something that JackCaulfield...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Oh, yes.HALDEMAN:...came up with back in '71, and we neededsome intelligence and ought to set up our own Intertel.EHRLICHMAN:So then he went on to say that, uh, uh, uh,there were only those meetings - he's stillhung up on the only three, uh, only three meetings thing. He made it very clear to methat he didn't ever believe there was afourth meeting. He said that, of course --HALDEMAN:He wasn't in the fourth meeting, John.There were only three meetings as far ashe's concerned.EHRLICHMAN:No, no, but he didn't refer to three orfour, he referred to the, the meetingsthemselves. He, he argues that there was nomeeting after the million dollar meeting, let me put it that way.HALDEMAN:Oh, really.EHRLICHMAN:Right. That's the sense of what he wassaying. I didn't press him on it and I tried to play him with kid gloves. In fact, I never asked him to tell me anything.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:He just came forward with all this stuff. PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, he says that, uh, uh, actually, uh,Magruder is going to have a problem with all this because Dean talked Magruder into saying the wrong thing to the Grand Jury,and, uh, uh, so Magruder's got a problem.PRESIDENT:My God, Mitchell was there. EHRLICHMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:Isn't that the meeting they're referring to?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. HALDEMAN:Sure. PRESIDENT:Mitchell was there when Dean talked him intosaying the wrong things?HALDEMAN:That's what he says. That's what the,that's what Mitchell says.PRESIDENT:What does Dean say about it?EHRLICHMAN:Dean, uh... Dean says it was Mitchell andMagruder who agreed.HALDEMAN:Well, uh, -- EHRLICHMAN:It must have been the quietest meeting inhistory because everybody's version is thatthe other two guys talked.PRESIDENT:Go ahead. Let's hear the rest of it.EHRLICHMAN:Well, it goes on like that. Uh, his, hischaracterization of all this is that he was a very busy man, that he wasn't keeping track of what was going on at the Committee,that this was engendered as a result of Huntand Liddy coming to Colson's office and getting Colson to make a phone call to, uh,Magruder and that, uh, he, Mitchell, wasjust not aware that all that happened until, uh, Van Shumway brought Liddy into Mitchell's office sometime in June, andthat's the first he had knowledge of it.Much later in the conversation, --HALDEMAN:Before the discovery? EHRLICHMAN:Uh, well, I don't know.(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. He didn't, he didn't(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:You can listen to it. I've got it taped.(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:But in any event, much later, uh, I saidthat the Grand Jury felt, or the U.S.Attorney felt, that they had John, uh,wired. And he said, "Well, what possible evidence could they have to, uh, feel thatway?" And I...PRESIDENT:John Dean or John Mitchell? EHRLICHMAN:John Mitchell. And I said, "Well, Iunderstand that one version of the facts isthat Magruder brought you a memo with anumber of targets on it, and that you checked off the targets that you wanted."And he said, Why, that, nothing could befurther from truth than that.PRESIDENT:That was John Dean's version?HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:That's what he said he said to Mitchell? EHRLICHMAN:Right. Then --HALDEMAN:What Mitchell said to me was that he did not- he said, "I checked, I signed off on it."PRESIDENT:Yeah. Go ahead.HALDEMAN:I said, "You mean you initialed it," and hesaid, "No. "EHRLICHMAN:Then, uh, I said, uh, they had res jestae byHunt and Liddy having a conversation, andLiddy saying to Hunt, "Yes, I know how youdon't like this stuff. We have to do it because Mr. Mitchell insists on it." Hesaid, "I never saw Liddy for five months.From February to June, I never laid eyes onhim." He said, "I think Liddy is the source of a lot of my problems here, he's using myname, and so forth. Uh, so it's very muchof a hard line thing. He said, uh, uh, "If I'm indicted, it is gonna be very hard, but," he said (Clears Throat) "I have tothink of my reputation." Uh, he said, "Ican't let people get away with this kind of thing," and he said, "I am just going tohave to defend myself every way I can.""Because," he said, "Obviously I can't get a, I can't get a fair trial in the city of Washington by any stretch of theimagination. We'll just have to see howthat all comes out." Uh, he said, "I am sorry to hear that so much of this is goingto come to the White House." Uh, he said,uh, "Certainly it's not in the President's interest to have all this kind of thing come out." He made a great point of the$350,000. He says that his recollection --and he said, "You want to check this because," He said, "I'm not, I'm very vagueon the facts of this." But he said, I, uh,uh, I, I told him about Strachan, because Strachan used to work for him. And I told him that Strachan had been, and has to goback and correct from 350 to 328. Well, hesaid, "That wasn't the only invasion of thatmoney." And I said, "Oh?" And he said, "No, you would have to check with John Dean on this but," he said, "it's my recollectionthat Dean had Strachan draw other money outof that fund for payment to these defendants." And I said, "Well, that's thefirst I heard of that. I understood thatStrachan had gone to Bob and said what about this fund, and Bob said send it back to the Committee and, uh, that Strachan had takenit to LaRue as a representative of theCommittee." He said, "Yes, I think that's the way it all went, but not until some ofit had been tapped for the defendants." AndI said, uh, uh, ...HALDEMAN:(Coughing) I think your defense is, it wasnot known to anybody over here who wasgonna, whoever received it.EHRLICHMAN:No. I said (tapping) "Was that before themoney got to LaRue?" And he said, "Yes, I am sure it was." And I said, "Well, whowould know about that cause I've never heardthat before?" And he said, 'well, I think Dean." So --PRESIDENT:The $328,000 is wrong, too, then?EHRLICHMAN:Well, if Mitchell is to be believed, that'sright, uh, that's the inference. But, uh, you don't know of any other withdrawal doyou, Bob?HALDEMAN:Well, I told you EHRLICHMAN:Yep.HALDEMAN:...the $328,000 was not returned in onetrip.EHRLICHMAN:But it all went to LaRue? HALDEMAN:That's what I'm told.PRESIDENT:...In one trip? I mean he did it twice?UNIDENTIFIED:Yep. HALDEMAN:Here, here's the sequence on that. Wewanted to get the money back to theCommittee. The Committee wouldn't take it.Mitchell wouldn't let LaRue take it. I saidgive it all back. LaRue, Mitchell said no.Then they got desperate for money, and being desperate for money took back -- I think it was $4O,OOO. And that's all they wouldtake. I still said, "Take it all back, notjust, not just, not just a segment of it", and made, uh, the point that I didn't seewhat the problem was. If they needed moneyand we wanted to get rid of money, it seemed to me it was of mutual interest in working it out. And that, then, was what happened.The balance -- If, if- $40,000 were taken inone trip then whatever -- (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Tell Strachan in his testimony on Mondaythat he better be, he better be clear thathe didn't give it all in one bunch.HALDEMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:Right, 'cause Strachan has testifiedapparently that he gave the whole bundle atonce.HALDEMAN:No, sir, he has not. EHRLICHMAN:No, he wasn't asked that.PRESIDENT:He wasn't asked?HALDEMAN:His testimony in that area is not wrong. PRESIDENT:Good.EHRLICHMAN:Now, John kept referring to, kept using aphrase, "protecting the rights of people." One of the ways that he used that phrase was in response to my question about what hethought I oughta do with the informationthat I had collected in the last several weeks.(Unintelligible)And he said, Uh, Well, you have to first ofall consider the rights of the individual." I said, "Yes. At the same time, here is thePresident sitting here now with a body ofhearsay and not absolute knowledge. Uh, my inclination is to give it to Kleindienst."And, uh, he thought about that awhile and hesaid' "Yes, I guess that's, that's the bestthing he could do." I said, "Now you shouldknow that Kleindienst just said that if you,in any way, get the crack in this case, that he is going to step aside, regardless of this whole case." And I said, "I understandHenry Pre, Petersen also will."HALDEMAN:Really? EHRLICHMAN:And, yeah,...HALDEMAN:I think you've got to be kidding.EHRLICHMAN:...and, uh, I said "That the thingKleindienst is pushing for is a special prosecutor." John said, "That would be agrave mistake because it would be subversiveto the orderly process of justice if every time you have an important case you striveto put together an ad hoc process."PRESIDENT:Well, how ridiculous-the presentprosecutor's going like hell any way.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, so, Uh, I said, uh, "At least, hethought he should step aside." He got avery wry smile on his face, and he said, "Well it's great to have friends isn't it?" He says, "Especially the way that we stuckby them" --meaning the ITT business, Iassume.PRESIDENT:Because of Kleindienst.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, so, uh, that was a, that was aninteresting little aside. He said, "I Would be very grateful if you would all kind of keep me posted."HALDEMAN:Really?EHRLICHMAN:And I said, "Fine." He knew that we weretalking to Chappie Rose. Uh, I told him nodecision had been made about a SpecialCounsel, but that we were inclined not to appoint a Special Prosecutor; that you were...PRESIDENT:He doesn't mind a Special Counsel?EHRLICHMAN:And, he thinks it's a good idea to have aSpecial Counsel. He suggested that maybethe Special Counsel should be the one to gotalk to Kleindienst, rather than, uh,somebody from the White House staff. And,uh, uh, so that, that was his only reactionto that. Uh, I told him again that I thought he ought to be represented, and that Paul O'Brien was now a target of this GrandJury and that I thought he really had tothink about getting representation. He said he had given it a lot of thought, but thathe, uh, didn't think that he would want tomake a change yet. He thought he would wait and see how O'Brien got along. Uh...HALDEMAN:Which confirms he considers O'Brien to behis attorney?EHRLICHMAN:Right. HALDEMAN:That's interesting.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, (tapping), he asked me how he wasinvolved, in, in, what I had heard about the prosecutor's view of Mitchell's involvement in the obstruction of justice suit. I saidthat I really had not been able to findanybody who was an efficient actor, who really went to a defendant and said, "Don't talk," or so and so. And he said, 'hell, I,I really wonder if you ever will, other thantheir lawyers, because, uh, my impression of this is that they were the ones who wereworried about their fees and who were reallycoming to us rather than for any of us going to them to bring about a change in testimony. Matter of fact," he said,HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) ...all alongEHRLICHMAN:"the thing that, uh, that we were talking toDean about," he said, "I wasn't reallyworried about what they testified to. I wasworried about what they'd say to the press."HALDEMAN:Exactly when Hunt made the challenge. EHRLICHMAN:Yep.HALDEMAN:That, somehow, Dean doesn't see that, thatway.EHRLICHMAN:Well, we've got to talk to him some more.Uh, he, uh, he, Mitchell; did not mentionMartha at all, or and I didn't raise it. That was just not even in the conversation.UNIDENTIFIED:(Coughing) Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, Oh, I told him that, uh, the only waythat I knew that he was mentioned, insofar as the aftermath was concerned, was that from time to time he would send Dean oversaying, "Hey, we need money for this," andhe said, uh, "Who told you that?"HALDEMANJohn Dean.EHRLICHMAN:And I said, "John that's, that's, that'scommon knowledge. And, uh, Dean, among others has told me that." Uh, I said, "Dean has not been subpoenaed. He has nottestified and, as a matter of fact, the waythey are proceeding down there, it looks like they are losing interest in him."(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:I, in a sense, well said this to Johnbecause I wanted him to be impressed with the fact that, uh, uh, we were not jobbinghim.PRESIDENT:Oh, I get it, the point. Yeah. Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:We were -- Dean (unintelligible). That'sit.PRESIDENT:Does he know that Magruder's going toconfess?EHRLICHMAN:I said that in the course of calling toinvite people to come talk with me today,and I indicated that there were more than two, that the person who called was told that Dean intended to, uh --PRESIDENT:Magruder.EHRLICHMAN:Pardon me, er, er, Magruder intended to makea clean breast of it and that, that wasfirst party information and very reliable,and that that would tend to begin to unravel this thing from the center in both directions. And he agreed with that. Nowhe said, "which version is it that Magruderis going to testify to? Is it the one that he gave Bob and me in Bob's office' or is itsome other version?"HALDEMAN:That's not trueEHRLICHMAN:I said --PRESIDENT:What was the version he gave Bob? Was itanother version?EHRLICHMAN:Well, he let me tell you what Mitchell said.It was another gigging of the White House.Uh, he said, uh, uh, "You know, uh, in Bob'soffice, Magruder said that Haldeman had cooked this whole thing up over here in theWhite House and, uh --"PRESIDENT:Had he said that? EHRLICHMAN:Well, I mean, that's, you know, the sort of--PRESIDENT:All right.EHRLICHMAN:And that, uh, uh and that sort of -- PRESIDENT:Now wait a minute. Your conversation withMitchell is the one where, uh...HALDEMAN:I've got the notes somewhere. PRESIDENT:...where Mitchell (unintelligible) is onewhere -- Mitchell falls down on(unintelligible). Very good. It's good youhave it too, but, uh --EHRLICHMAN:Mitchell's theory -- PRESIDENT:Wait a minute, whatever his theory is, letme say a footnote...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...one, one footnote is, uh, that, uh, his,uh throwing it off on the White House isn'tgoing to help him one damn bit.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, uh, unless he can, unless he can peddlethe theory that Colson and others wereeffectively running the Committee throughMagruder and freezing him out of the operation, ...PRESIDENT:Hum.EHRLICHMAN:...which is kind of the story line he wasgiving me.HALDEMAN:Did he include me in the others?EHRLICHMAN:Yep.HALDEMAN:That I was freezing him out of theoperation?EHRLICHMAN:hat you, in other words, he didn't say thisbaldly or flatly, but you accumulated a whole, uh, a whole bunch of things, and it's Colson, Dean and Bob(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:..working with Magruder, and uh, that thatwas sort of the way the line up went.PRESIDENT:The fault is the White House's rather thanhis.HALDEMAN:He's got an impossible problem with that. PRESIDENT:Well, IHALDEl5AN:The poor guy is putting --PRESIDENT:It's bad if he gets up there and says that.It's a hell of a problem for us.HALDEMAN:It's a problem for us. No question. Butthere's no way he can prove it. He has a very, very bad tremor.PRESIDENT:He's always had that.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I've never noticed...PRESIDENT:Shakes. EHRLICHMAN:...it as bad as this. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah.HALDEMAN:It's always been bad.PRESIDENT:You've done your, uh, done your duty today.(unintelligible) .HALDEMAN:The next question is,EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:...the next question is whether you seeMagruder or not and you're now set to seehim at 4 o'clock, and if we're going tocancel him, we should do it right now.EHRLICHMAN:I see no purpose in seeing him.PRESIDENT:Why, because Magruder's, uh, Magruder'saware of the fact now that we --HALDEMAN:Magruder's already going to do what John'sgoing to tell him to do, so...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:So far, we've got it all --PRESIDENT:Our purpose of course, uh (unintelligible)do it. Our purpose, as I understood it -- what I mean Bob, was to keep a record forthe (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:All right. For that purpose maybe I should.Now, maybe what I should do --HALDEMAN:Let him tell you what he told me, and thenyou say, "Good."EHRLICHMAN:Exactly. PRESIDENT:I'd like to get, I'd like to get what thehell he's, uh, what he's going to say.EHRLICHMAN:All right. All right. PRESIDENT:I would particularly like to get what thehell he's going to say about Strachan.EHRLICHMAN:All right. PRESIDENT:I mean, I'd say, apparently, uh, you couldsay, "Look John, look Jeb, I have to conductthis investigation on the White House.(Unintelligible)." If he says Strachan knew, say how do you know he knows?EHRLICHMAN:All right.PRESIDENT:Do you think you should ask him that or doyou not want to go digging on that?HALDEMAN:Why not?EHRLICHMAN:Okay. (Tapping)PRESIDENT:All right. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Once he tells me that he, that heintends to go forward to tell the truth, hehas nothing to lose by talking to me.PRESIDENT:Hell. Well, I know. The point is that Iwant it to seem you want him to be, withoutguiding him or leading him, you can at leastmaybe get that out.EHRLICHMAN:Right. HALDEMAN:Well, his lawyer will be there.EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:The other thing is what about the, whatabout the, uh, -- of course, you realizethat if he says something about Strachan, then, of course, that puts an obligation on us to do something about Strachan doesn'tit?EHRLICHMAN:Well, at least to corroborate it or, or, uh,investigate it, or, or go forward on it.HALDEMAN:You could do it by questioning Strachan?EHRLICHMAN:Among other things. HALDEMAN:Here's where it ends up. EHRLICHMAN:Well, if it ends up that way, why then youhave a sort of a dog fight. Now, let...PRESIDENT:Excuse me, go ahead, sorry... HALDEMAN:I didn't think, Jeb is, let me put it, letme say this, I don't think Jeb wants to hangStrachan. I think Jeb is worried about the fact that in going through this, he is going to, to, he thinks, to a degree, implicateStrachan. Now, that's the same kind ofthinking as Strachan and Chapin, who were both very concerned about getting me into the Segretti thing. In other words, theythey see any involvement, any mentioning ofthe name as being a problem.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:I don't think Jeb sees it or understands thequestion of whether he really got Strachan in or not, and I'm not sure how far he decided he intends to go with, withStrachan.EHRLICHMAN:He didn't say, he didn't really make itclear?HALDEMAN:No. He just said, unfortunately, this wholething is going to come up and if it comes up...PRESIDENT:BobHALDEMAN:...but then, what's, what's the problem withGordon? And he said, "Well, I don't know. That depends on what other people say."PRESIDENT:Other people, meaning like a secretary, youmean, or somebody who typed...HALDEMAN:Could be.PRESIDENT:...typed a memorandum. HALDEMAN:Could be. PRESIDENT:To a degree, I think I see in Strachan'scase the, well, the other possibility, ofcourse, would be, uh, maybe they're very likely, oh, I think it might be this Bob,that, uh, they're gonna ask the question,"who told you to do this Jeb, Mr. Magruder?" (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:He's flatly denied that Strachan told him todo it. Now, Larry did, Larry did, hebrought back that exact story that he, that he --PRESIDENT:Colson. What about the Colson(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Uh, he says that he's going, going to haveto hurt Mitchell.HALDEMAN:He says, "The one I'm going to hurt isMitchell, and to some degree, John Dean and maybe Gordon."PRESIDENT:He's obviously talked this through. Isn'tit worthwhile for you to find out, uh,HALDEMAN:I think we have to, PRESIDENT:...I think we owe it to ourselves to findout about John Dean, for examples what he,now understand, that he thinks (unintelligible) this is true (unintelligible)...us.EHRLICHMAN:All right. I think that's right. This isprobably a golden opportunity in a way.PRESIDENT:Right. To find, well, let me put it thisway. We've got to find out what the hellhe's gonna say...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...so that we'll know what to expect, yousee...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...rather than have the God damned thing goon our heads.EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:The interesting thing is, uh, did, did, didBob tell you -- are you, uh, prepared to say that he says that, uh, he, uh, Magruder,said that they'll indict him and notMitchell. That's a hard damn theory. Isn't that what you told me? Bob, didn't you tellme that?HALDEMAN:No. No. He said everybody, no, he said"Everybody is going to fall on this." He wasn't meaning indictments. He was meaninggonna talk.PRESIDENT:Oh. HALDEMAN:Himself, LaRue and so on.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:He said everybody's, everybody's going todrop except John. And, he's gonna get out of it.(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:That's correct. That's correct. HALDEMAN:He didn't mean that, that Mitchell wouldn'tbe indicted. He meant that Mitchell,Mitchell was the only one who was going tocontinue to hardline, that everybody else had given up. And that's why he's given up.His point is, his keeping quiet now or lyingnow serves no purpose cause all they're gonna do is get him on a perjury count as well as everything else. If he can clean upanything he can live with himself better.He's faced the fact that he's had it.(Pause)PRESIDENT:Uh huh, so that means LaRue and O'Brien. Isthat right?HALDEMAN:Depends on how far they go. EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Jeb doesn't know anything much about that. PRESIDENT:It's under cover. They'll push him.I think he can put up a pretty good fight onthe thing, don't you?HALDEMAN:I would think so. I, I would be, uh -- PRESIDENT:Even if they indict him' it's going to be adamn hard, hard, intricate case to prove.You've got to prove motive there, don't you,John?EHRLICHMAN:Yes. Dean, (Clears Throat) Dean argues thatin a, in a conspiracy, uh, such as they'retrying to build, they may not have to prove the same kind of animus as to some of the participants, but only that they were, thatthey were in it. Uh, I, I would have toread the cases. I just don't know what the law is.PRESIDENT:Of course, you've got their, you've gottheir defendants the same way, I guess, uh, ...HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:...I guess, uh, that key witness there isHunt.EHRLICHMAN:Well, the defendants, and then it's, uh, thedefendant's lawyer, Bittman.PRESIDENT:Hunt and Bittman. They're both, Hunt willtestify tomorrow.EHRLICHMAN:My, my guess is that a fellow like Bittmanhas probably negotiated immunity forhimself, and has --HALDEMAN:Dean strongly feels they wouldn't give it tohim.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, I know.PRESIDENT:They will? HALDEMAN:Will not.EHRLICHMAN:But that, uh, he's gonna, he's gonna tellabout a lot of conversations he had with a lot of people.PRESIDENT:Bittman is?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Do we know that?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I don't know that, but I know, forinstance, that Bittman had a conversationwith Colson that was a Watergate conversation. And, uh, uh, I know, I know what Colson says about it -- that he wasbrilliant and adroit, avoided any...HALDEMAN:And he says Bittman's recollection of itwould be exactly the same as Colson's -- hisrecollection of the, of the specificconversation -- but he says Bittman may draw conclusions from it.PRESIDENT:This is the clemency conversation?HALDEMAN:Yep.(Pause)PRESIDENT:And his conclusion would be that he felt thePresident offered clemency?HALDEMAN:No. His conclusion is that, that, he, he,uh, Colson will have Hunt out by Christmas, because you know what kind, what kind ofpull I have here in the White House. I'llbe able to work it out. That's what he would, would imply by saying --PRESIDENT:What, how does Colson handle that?EHRLICHMAN:He says he's got a tape or a wire, uh, uh, amemo or something that says exactly what he saidHALDEMAN:It's just a memo. He wrote a, he wrote amemorandum of the conversation immediately after the conversation. Which will, that's all it is, is his side of the story.PRESIDENT:You don't think this, this would lead to anindictment of Colson do you?EHRLICHMAN:(Sighs) I haven't any idea. Dean seems tothink everybody in the place is going to getindicted. (Laughs) No, this afternoon -- Well, I...HALDEMAN:They're all doing the same thing. What Deansaid is just looking at the worst possibleside of the coin that you could make a list of everybody who in some way is technicallyindictable in the cover-up operation. Andthat list includes, in addition to Mitchell,Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Colson, Dean, --PRESIDENT:Because they all discussed it?HALDEMAN:Strachan, Kalmbach, Kalmbach's go-between,Kalmbach's source, LaRue, Mardian, O'Brien, Parkinson, ...EHRLICHMAN:BittmanHALDEMAN:Bittman, Hunt, uh, and, and, you know, so,and just to keep wandering through theimpossibles, he said maybe the route is for,for everybody on that list to take a guilty plea and, and get immediate, uh, uh, what do you call it, pardon, or, uh, ...EHRLICHMAN:Clemency.HALDEMAN:...clemency. PRESIDENT:From the President.HALDEMAN:Hmm. That shows you the somewhat unclearstate (Laughs) of John Dean's analytical thinking.EHRLICHMAN:No way.PRESIDENT:It's a shame. There could be clemency inthis case and at the proper time, having in mind the extraordinary sentences of Magruder, and so forth and so on, but youknow damn well...HALDEMAN:It's gotta be down the road PRESIDENT:It's ridiculous. They all know that.Colson knew that. I mean when you talked toColson and he talked to me.EHRLICHMAN:The, uh, Magruder thing is 4 o'clock andit's still on.HALDEMAN:Yeah. I think I have to go confirm it.EHRLICHMAN:All right. HALDEMAN:Should I?EHRLICHMAN:I think so. It's an opportunity -- Now thequestion is whether I ought to get a hold of Kleindienst for, say 5 o'clock and get this thing all wrapped up.PRESIDENT:Have you determined it should be Kleindienstrather than Silbert?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Dean's right about that. I'm sure.PRESIDENT:I didn't know you'd talked to Dean.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I did, I asked Dean's advice on this.He said Silbert would ask you to wait a minute, he'd step out of the room, he'd comeback to get you and he'd walk you right intothe Grand Jury.PRESIDENT:Oh.EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, he, he doesn't dare handle acommunication like that personally, from the standpoint of the later criticism. He says the better route would be to go toKleindienst, who will probably step asideand refer you to the Dean. The Dean, in turn, would say to Henry Petersen, "They'ddone this little investigation over at theWhite House, they've collected a bunch of hearsay, there doesn't seem to be much new, but they've got it there for anybody whowants it." Petersen, in turn, would informSilbert, who would, "thank God, I got more than I can handle here now, we'll wait and interview that guy later."PRESIDENT:The purpose in doing this is what? (Sighs)EHRLICHMAN:The purpose of doing it is to --- PRESIDENT:The White House conducted its investigationand turned it over to the Grand Jury.EHRLICHMAN:Turned it over to the, to the JusticeDepartment.PRESIDENT:Before the indictment?EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:How much are you going to tell them? EHRLICHMAN:I, I think I'd let 'em drag it out of me ina way. I don't know, I just really haven'tthought that part through.PRESIDENT:Because they would say, "Why did the WhiteHouse wait for the Justice Department to doall this?"EHRLICHMAN:"Did the White House know?" is probably theway this would come. YesPRESIDENT:Yes. And you'd say, yes, as a matter offact...EHRLICHMAN:We had, we had been at work on this for sometime. The President, the President...PRESIDENT:...President ordered an independentinvestigation.EHRLICHMAN:...needed it known.PRESIDENT:I had ordered an independent investigationat the time McCord had something to say.Right.EHRLICHMAN:All right. PRESIDENT:At that time, you conducted aninvestigation.EHRLICHMAN:And that a, at the time, I was ready toreport to you my tentative conclusions, and they were no more than that, you felt thatthey were sufficiently serious that, uh,well that, you felt that one overriding aspect of the report was that some people evidently were hanging back feeling thatthey were somehow doing the President afavor. That the President had me personally transmit to them his view that this ought to be a complete open thing, that may or maynot have played some part in Jeb Magruder'ssubsequent disclosures to the Grand Jury. In any event, uh, uh, rather than for ussimply to hold the information that we didhave in the White House, we turned it over to the Justice Department for whatever disposition they wanted to make of it.(Pause)PRESIDENT:If Mitchell is indicted here, you think he'sgoing to be convicted?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, I think so. I can't guarantee it, butI would be amazed once, once Magruder goes in there.PRESIDENT:But, that's only one man.EHRLICHMAN:Ah, that's plenty.PRESIDENT:Is it? EHRLICHMAN:Oh, yes sir, and uh, well...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) know criminal law?EHRLICHMAN:With all the other stuff they've got, uh,...PRESIDENT:All the other stuff they've got?EHRLICHMAN:...they have a way of corroborating, uh -- ********** Part IIHALDEMAN:They delivered part of it at the time theyasked for it, and the balance at the time they asked for it. My interest wasdelivering all of it as quickly as possible.I don't know what their function was.********** PRESIDENT:Could I just make the suggestion ofMagruder, first, get everything you can fromhim, Uh.HALDEMAN:He's bringing two lawyers with him.EHRLICHMANNaturally. What'll we'll, what we'll do.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Probably one Jewish and one Gentile.(Laughs)PRESIDENT:Well, you know Jeb, I mean, I don't knowwhat, what about (unintelligible) they Strachan, but they want Dean.HALDEMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:Just trying to get the facts and that's allthere is to it.EHRLICHMAN:I'll get back to you...PRESIDENT:Be sure you convey my warm sentiments.EHRLICHMAN:Right.(21 second pause) (Sound of door closing)HALDEMAN:I think I ought to get Strachan squaredaway.PRESIDENT:Sure. HALDEMAN:He covers.PRESIDENT:Well, we'll see what they finally come downto here (unintelligible). I, I frankly think- frankly, frankly I should say I don't know, but based on what Ehrlichman tells meabout the law it's a matter of withholdingevidence, as far as that was concerned.That was Mitchell's point and the matter of motive doesn't seem to be important.moment it's, uh, it's the important...HALDEMAN:Well the only sticky wicket on that is Dean.I can't understand because, 'cause -- in his interest too, as well as everyone else's, tosee the motive for what it was.(27 second pause)PRESIDENT:I guess we're not surprised at Mitchell, arewe?HALDEMAN:No. It's partly true.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:What he's saying is partly true. I don'tthink he did put it together.PRESIDENT:Hmh. He shouldn't - he shouldn't throw theburden over here, Bob, on you. Now, frankly, Colson I understand, but, causeColson certainly put the heat on over there.I don't think John would seriously have believed that you put him up to this thing.HALDEMAN:I told you I didn't. He knows I didn't.(Unintelligible). No question of that.PRESIDENT:I should think he knows it. He let it allhappen himself. (20 second pause) (bangingon desk to beat of music) So he saw more,huh?HALDEMAN:That's what he says. PRESIDNET:You know he'll never - he'll never go toprison. (20 second pause) What do you thinkabout that as a possible thing - does a trial of the former Attorney General of theUnited States bug you? This God damn case.********** HALDEMAN:It really is.(18 second pause)PRESIDENT:He'll have to take the stand at some time.What the hell is this anyhow?
