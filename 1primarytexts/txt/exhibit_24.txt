HALDEMAN ONAPRIL 16, 1973, FROM 9:50 TO 9:59 A.M.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) John, I want him to, uh, touh, before I see Dean. I tell ya what Ireally want, I want him to sign.EHRLICHMAN:Did you get those? PRESIDENT:Yes, I did.PRESIDENT:I'm going to have him sign. I'm going toask him which one he wants to sign and say about that news clip that, uh, it seems tome that I should not, uh, I mean I, I, don'twant to press anything and uh, I'm not, or, or, should I just have him sign it, whether it's effective today or uh, not announce it.What's your advice on that? We've gotplenty of time. Don't worry about that.EHRLICHMAN:Well, my -- as I made them out it occurredto me he ought to sign both of them. Then,you could use whichever one you wanted ornot depending on how circumstances unfold.PRESIDENT:OK, that's right, that's right. GoodEHRLICHMAN:And if he won't. You know, you know what todo at that pant.HALDEMAN:And if he -- you go, you go to Petersen andask you not to...SEVERALVOICES:Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I still have my option, I still have myoption to do that. The second Points Johnthat I want to nail down, uh, what Dean said about other bugs the White House and so forth and so on. Aren't, isn't -- I assumethat's the Plumbing operation.EHRLICHMAN:No, no, no. What he's referring to there... PRESIDENT:about the FBI --EHRLICHMAN:is, is the FBI bugs on the journalists inthe first year.PRESIDENT:This was not from you. He thought thesewere private bugs.EHRLICHMAN:Oh no. No, no. These, these . . PRESIDENT:No, he said they were . . EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, well, I...PRESIDENT:...private bugs.EHRLICHMAN:These were... PRESIDENT:That he knew about.EHRLICHMAN:These were almost all FBI bugs, but notentirely though.PRESIDENT:What, what is he, what is he referring to ifit -- what I'm just saying...EHRLICHMAN:They're all national security.PRESIDENT:ELI, that's what I mean. EHRLICHMAN:But, I...PRESIDENT:I was wondering if -- what's your advice, ifI should not tell him today that anything in that area is national security and privileged.EHRLICHMAN:I think you should, and I think it shouldcover not only that, but the Plumbing operation, and uh, anything else of which he has knowledge.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Say I am impressing that with executivePrivilege right now.PRESIDENT:Executive privilege.EHRLICHMAN:And I don't want to ever hear . PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...that you have discussed those matters...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...with any third person. PRESIDENT:I don't know whether he did. He might have.EHRLICHMAN:Well, you might ask him if he has...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...afterwards, uh, or before. But...PRESIDENT:But I --see, that didn't occur to me lastnight it occurred to me (unintelligible) inwhich case I'm going to get him in.EHRLICHMAN:Now, if you remember that whole operationwas because you were afraid there were leaksout of the NSC.PRESIDENT:That's right, that's right. EHRLICHMAN:And you were trying to find them.PRESIDENT:I thought we were --, I thought they werethrough the FBI.EHRLICHMAN:Well, almost all of them -- PRESIDENT:We were going to do some of them.EHRLICHMAN:Almost all of them were but there was one inGeorgetown at somebody's house that actually never was put on. It wasn't feasible, butit was explored and, and how Dean knowsabout that, I don't know. The FBI files...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Does Liddy know? EHRLICHMAN:I can't, I can't say. I doubt it. I thinkthat was before his time.PRESIDENT:The reason that I made the call while inDean's presence last night was that he said that Liddy's -- Liddy would say how he knowsthis, that Liddy had told the Bureau orsomething like that. I said, "Dean, what should I do?" "Well," he said, "you oughtto get ahold of his attorney." I said"Yeah, (unintelligible) his attorney" (unintelligible) and he said, he said, "Liddy says he will not talk because ofhigher authority." I said, "Now look here,higher authorities, it's not the President, it's Mitchell." And I said, "Well"--so Icalled Petersen, I said, "You are to tellLiddy's attorney that -- or Liddy, that there's, the President's not asking" -- Don't you think that's the correct thing todo?HALDEMAN:That's -- EHRLICHMAN:It can't hurt anything at this point and itcer-tainly is consistent with the things youhad to do with Mitchell and Magruder.PRESIDENT:Such as like what? The --EHRLICHMAN:Remove any impediment against theirtestifying by reason of any misplaced loyalty to you.PRESIDENT:One thing I was, uh, Bob will run over withyou (unintelligible), the uh, uh, subject isvery important to just tick it off briefly, before one, that if you and he can sit downtoday and put both your cases down at theirworst as how you think it's going to come out, you know, so that I can look at them and as I say, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonnamake any God damn hasty decisions until Isee what the hell, how this bounces around, because -- Petersen is obviously reacting tothe Magruder thing.BULL:[At door] John Dean is here, Mr. President. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) about five or ten minutes.(Unintelligible) building construction(unintelligible) Christ! Uh, it's obviouslydisturbed so that --and they're out to demonstrate over there doing this job. The second point is that uh, I would like also ascenario evolved with regard to, uh, thePresident's role, in other words, when the President began to find out about this, whathe did, I think it's a pretty good roleJohn, I'm, I'm not sure of it. It's as good as I can guess because remember I got Dean in, first I said I wanted him to report,sent him to Camp David. He came back andsaid he couldn't and I want to ask him about that today, and then you, and I'd like youto give Steve your report and everything youdid -- see what I mean. Also, then, third, there is the PR thing, as to, when we, when we disclosed that and how.EHRLICHMAN:Ziegler has just left my office. He feelswe have no more than twelve hours.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, he, he's got some, uh, input from thePost and uh, it's his estimate that unless we take the initiative by nine o'clock tonight,PRESIDENT:Uh hum. ~EHRLICHMAN:uh, it will be too late. Now, for thatreason, I would suggest that Ziegler sit in a meeting with Petersen and that you and Ziegler persuade Petersen that theannouncement has to come from the WhiteHouse.PRESIDENT:I'll tell him.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, otherwise the Justice Department will,of course, try andPRESIDENT:Uh, huh. EHRLICHMANpre-empt this while thing.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:But I think it would be a good idea for youto spend, uh,...PRESIDENT:I don't -- I think, I think I've got to getPetersen in alone first.EHRLICHMAN:Sure, sure, I understand. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) then I'll pull Ziegler inHALDEMAN:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Uh. PRESIDENT:That's a very good point.EHRLICHMAN:Now, you may want to listen to Ron for sometime ahead of time. He's got this well thought through and, and well laid out, andI think he's quite dispassionate about it,quite, quite, uh...HALDEMAN:Well, we'11 go over that with him. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, we'll do that now while you're gone.HALDEMAN:There's one point in -- before you talk toDean that, that I, occurred to me last night that doesn't fit together. Maybe it doesn'tmatter, and that is you said, last night, asI understood it, that Petersen had told you that Liddy has not talked.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:And that they can't get Liddy to talk.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Dean told us that Liddy had told them everything.EHRLICHMAN:Told the U.S. Attorney everything. HALDEMAN:There's something screwy... EHRLICHMAN:Informally.HALDEMAN:There's something screwy.PRESIDENT:I know that, I know that, but I... HALDEMAN:Petersen's either lying to you or Dean Islying to usPRESIDENT:I may be, maybe a little bold but, what Ithink is probably closer to the truth is that Dean started this business a few weeksago with his attorneys...HALDEMAN:Uh um. EHRLICHMAN:Uh um.PRESIDENT:...and decided to save his ass and hisattorney's, went in and probably the U.S. Attorney gave him a snow job and said that you're -- that Liddy has talked.EHRLICHMAN:Either that or Dean used that story as acover-upPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:...in case anything started to seep out.PRESIDENT:Did a cover-up.HALDEMAN:Yeah. Then it would of come from Liddyrather than...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah.HALDEMAN:...from him. PRESIDENT:How's Ron think it ought to be done? Ishould do it.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, Ron thinks that it ought to be done fromhere, uh, that uh... well, he hasn't said whether you should do it. Uh, I mentionedit to him the other day that you thought youshould do it here in the Press room, if you did it at all.PRESIDENT:I could do it right here in the Oval Office.EHRLICHMAN:Yes, uh, but he, he wants to get out thefact that uh, Dean disserved you, that theDean report was inadequate, it didn't go far enough, that, uh, several weeks ago, uh, you reinstituted uh, uh, an examination ofthe...PRESIDENT:I began my personal investigation of thecase.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, and that this culminated in a wholeseries of actionsPRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:over the weekend.PRESIDENT:Personal investigation of the case in that Ispent the weekend working on it. I think that's what we've got to say. The Dean rep,report, did not, did not, uh...HALDEMAN:That this is the week of Mitchell being hereSaturday is very important to the circumstances.PRESIDENT:Thaws right. But uh, the President askedEhrlichman to conduct his own investigation.EHRLICHMAN:Well, now, if I'm going to be, if I'm goingto be splashed on this thing, you're betteroff not having another discredited Dean.PRESIDENT:Yeah, well, somebody's got to do it. EHRLICHMAN:Well, you can downplay who did it.HALDEMAN:You can say you did it yourself by talkingto all the people...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...concerned.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:You talked to me and Ehrlichman andeverybody else...SEVERALVOICES:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I, I made my own investigation of thematter.EHRLICHMAN:I think that's that's the way.PRESIDENT:My own investigation of the matter. But Ididn't talk to Mitchell, see.EHRLICHMAN:Well, they say who did and you delegated meto do that. I mean that's, that's -- but, uh, ...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Ehrlichman(unintelligible)-- look you're splash thoughis only on this one God damn thing.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think there's a, there's a judgmentcall here, ...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...as to whether you want the quoteEhrlichman report unquote...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...out in the, in the media. PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:(unintelligible) because they'll make a bigthing about the Dean report...PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...found out that Dean was guilty and theEhrlichman report found out thatEhrlichman...PRESIDENT:Right. No, no. Now query, uh, would youmind telling Moore to see Gray or is thatout of the question. I mean he, you cantalk to him can't you. The only point is time is of the essence right now. I, youknow, I, I, I, I've got odds and ends heretoday that I have to...EHRLICHMAN:I, I understand PRESIDENT:No, I'll do it.EHRLICHMAN:No, no, I'll take care of it.PRESIDENT:Alright, what you can say is -- give him thetwo by four, say now, look here, here's thesituation. Have you talked to Fielding yetto find out what the situation is?EHRLICHMAN:No. No. No, as a matter of fact, I've gota problem Were. I'm going to have Mooretalk to Fielding also, ...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:and find out what was in there, because Idon't want to know.PRESIDENT:Right, that's right (unintelligible) that'sgreat.EHRLICHMAN:And then Moore can advise you.PRESIDENT:OK, and, uh, -- then, I don't know whatstatement -- I'd like to have Ron, maybe between now and the time -- I, I, I, I, I'veput off my, the meeting with the guy at1:30, John.EHRLICHMAN:Um. PRESIDENT:Uh, Petersen, I mean, I had to because Icouldn't get time to go through...EHRLICHMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:...what he wants. (unintelligible) butthat's just well enough because it gives mea chance when I get back to take my breath and take a look at that.EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:And be ready for it. But uh, but I'm, uh,I'm not going to let him, uh, him put this out that the Justice Department dragged this out of the White House. You God damnedrights. In fact I'll, uh, -- now I can havehim do it.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'll tell you what you might do ishave him standing by you...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...just standing there, you do it, and thenyou say Petersen here is...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...working with me on this. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yesterday, yesterday, I, I, uh, I,uh, I, I, talked to Mr. Kleindienst. Uh,he, uh, removed himself, uh, from my, uh, some investigation of people that are involved (unintelligible) some case. Idirected it, uh, to Petersen. I made adecision on Petersen myself but he wanted a special prosecutor.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:I, I, said alright, we'll go with Petersen,say that's right Petersen will be with me and Mr. Petersen is in charge of this and so forth and so on. I want Petersen to be ableto say what I (unintelligible) that I madethe record with him like nobody's business last night.EHRLICHMAN:Well, he's got every incentive, so.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Well, now in, in seeing Dean now, ... PRESIDENT:Yeah, but the question is...EHRLICHMAN:...I think uh, uh, the point is that in, in,uh, taking these letters from him, uh, it would be the agreement that neither he noryou would announce it immediately.PRESIDENT:No. EHRLICHMAN:So the announcement would be an yourdiscretion, ...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...and the decision would be in yourdiscretion as to which way you go.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:But that in view -- and you might ask himwhether he intends to plead guilty or not.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Or...EHRLICHMAN:Or not guilty, Because that will weigh...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...in your, in your ultimate decision. PRESIDENT:That's right, that's right.HALDEMAN:Then we've got a cop out.EHRLICHMAN:Well, then that will come out. PRESIDENT:That's right, I'm going to find out(unintelligible) well, let me say that if,if he, if he, uh, he gets a cop out he's gonna, he's gonna be dead. Which really (unintelligible). You can't have him aroundhere with the kind of stuff he's going tocop out about.HALDEMAN:Oh, no.EHRLICHMAN:Ask him what you should say publicly aboutthe Dean report.PRESIDENT:Yeah. He said, he told me, he says therewas no Dean report. I, uh, don't understandit. I think it was an oral report. I said, didn't I ask you what it's final outcome is?Yes. Didn't you say nobody's involved?Yes. I said was anybody involved? No.EHRLICHMAN:I see. PRESIDENT:Well, I went right down the line.EHRLICHMAN:You thought that, that's all was said.PRESIDENT:On the part of Ehrlichman, Colson and Dean,I said did you know; he said no. So atleast his line on that is that he didn'tknow about it before, prior knowledge.EHRLICHMAN:OK. PRESIDENT:Only one point that, uh, occurs to me thatuh, that, uh, he did discuss with me the,this need, for funds for Hunt. At least I remember the...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Did he come in, who did he discuss thatwith, (unintelligible) that Hunt needed attorney fees.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Did he do that to you personally? PRESIDENT:Yeah. He discussed it and asked about it.I said I don't know whether you can get it.I, I, I, I didn't but, but what I meant isthat it was so, uh --EHRLICHMAN:Well, you know what I was telling him at thesa-, at that time,...PRESIDENT:Uh huhm. EHRLICHMAN:...was that that should not be aconsideration this thing.PRESIDENT:Uh humm.EHRLICHMAN:And you know...PRESIDENT:And then they went back and, and so Mitchelltook care of it, I mean, ah...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, but not on, not on account of anyjeopardy to me obviously.PRESIDENT:Dean -- Huh?EHRLICHMAN:Not on account of any jeopardy to me. Imean he did that for his own purposes.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Mitchell.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Because I was saying look fellows if,if that's the only thing he's doing, is blackmailing me, why forget it, you know.PRESIDENT:Wait, wait, Hunt sent a message to you. Ididn't know about that.EHRLICHMAN:No, he didn't send it to me. He sent it to,to Dean about me.PRESIDENT:I didn't know that.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:What did he say I'm gonna talk aboutEhrlichman? (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:He's referring of course to the things thatwere done before.EHRLICHMAN:Sure.HALDEMAN:He said, I, I'm gonna pull the plug on allthe dirty stuff.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.HALDEMAN:He also said something about that.EHRLICHMAN: Now, also, you know, in thinking aboutthis...PRESIDENT:You told him, you told (unintelligible).Alright go ahead.EHRLICHMAN:...uh, in thinking about this... PRESIDENT:But who, but, but...HALDEMAN:John stonewall, stonewalled that completely.(Unintelligible) Dean, he doesn't have anything, there is nothing.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, do you remember when we were planningthe Hawaiian trip. The very activediscussion we had about Clark McGregor goingout and making a full disclosure on Watergate.PRESIDENT:Um hmm.EHRLICHMAN:And we had a plan.PRESIDENT:Right, that I was, I in on it. EHLRICHMAN:Well, you were -- we discussed with you thepossibility. The idea was that you'd be outof town and it wouldn't get on you.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Remember?PRESIDENT:Uh huh.EHRLICHMAN:And you know who shot that down? PRESIDENT:Uh, Dean?EHRLICHMAN:Dean and McGregor.HALDEMAN:And McGregor? EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Why?EHRLICHMAN:Because they felt that it would be damagingto the campaign.PRESIDENT:Oh, we all know that's a phony. EHRLICHMAN:But, somewhere, I think I did a memo on thatand I'm having it looked for now. But, inany event, uh, we made a kind of a full court press at that time. Remember, we wereat San Clemente and we were going to haveMcGregor come out there.PRESIDENT:Uh huh. EHRLICHMAN:And we had a lot of conversations on thephone and I blasted him and badgered him andurged him. And he dug his heels in and dug his heels in.HALDEMAN:At least five times during this period, Iwould get Dean into my office or he'd come in you know, with his problems and stuff. And we'd go through the whole thing. Ispoke to you of this a couple of, of thosetimes at least. I said, "John, why don'tyou just put the whole thing out and go withit." He said, "Oh no, we can't do that."And he can't -- he knows...PRESIDENT:What is the story behind what happened onthat, on that fee for, for representing, thelast thing for, for Hunt. Then, I mean, hementioned it to me and I, I...EHRLICHMAN:I know, I know none of the facts. Uh, Deantransmitted to me the threat...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...which he had received personally fromBittman and that, and, ...PRESIDENT:Right, right. Go ahead, go ahead.EHRLICHMAN:I said to John, "Look, if, if we're going tolive with this...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...all our lives, the hell with it." PRESIDENT:Right, good, good, good, then what? EHRLICHMAN:So then he went back to Mitchell,apparently, because the next thing I knewabout it, we had a meeting in Bob's office about something else and...PRESIDENT:MitchellEHRLICHMAN:Mitchell came in and Mitchell said I'vetaken care of it.PRESIDENT:Okay.
