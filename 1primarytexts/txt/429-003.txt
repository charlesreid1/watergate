After our talk yesterday, Ireferred to&#352;I was aiming at the Ervin Committee at that point (unintelligible) discussed. Figures though&#352;I mean--Len Garment's (unintelligible). Talked to Petersen again today and, uh, he was down here at the White House. And whatever he's charged with, lie'sgot (unintelligible) Just figures you can't keepthem (tape noise)--walked out in the sun (unintelligible) and put them, and put them, ahead of Mitchell. But I just don't think (tape noise). Did you have any different views today?ROGERS:No, I didn't.PRESIDENT:Do you think this is the right step(unintelligible)?ROGERS:I do.(Tape Noise)PRESIDENT:&#8211;can occur -- It's going to be--it's going to bebloody&#8211;APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.2ROGERSI think thatPRESIDENT:&#8211;believe me. ROGERS:&#8211;the top people in government deserve the sameconsideration&#8211;PRESIDENT:as a Communi-&#8211; ROGERS:&#8211;as anybody else.PRESIDENT:Our damn rights.ROGERSNot any more, but just as much, and, uh&#8211; PRESIDENT:But the idea that a top person in government is,uh-- uh, it isn't the question beyond reproach, you know. A person could be beyond reproach. Take me--I should have been fired many times--because I've been so heavily critized in thepress, many (unintelligible) things I didn't do.ROGERS:Yeah PRESIDENT:You remember. ROGERS:Well, as a matter of fact, it's a, a little bitthe same attitude that, uh, Lucius Clay had about you and the fund.PRESIDENT:Right.ROGERS:In comparison with Eisenhower, you should getoff. Well, that was really what he said.PRESIDIENT:I think the people will probably-- they willhave a view that &#338;the New York Times will have a cheap editorial tomorrow that the Presidentshould fire the whole White House staffROGERS:Oh well, that isn&#8482;t--(unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Anybody who did it. But I think the people&#352;Idon't know, correct me if I am wrong, I think they'd like a man who'd stand up to--not to condemn people before they're proven(unintelligible)APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.3ROGERS:Yeah.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). ROGERS:Well, I think that&#8211; PRESIDENT:And I don&#8482;t&#8211; ROGERS:&#8211;that, what did, what did Petersen say on Ehrlichman? Does he have any other evidence except what&#8482;s in that piece of paper? Because ifhe doesn't&#8211;PRESIDENT:Nope. ROGERS:&#8211;there wasn't&#8211; PRESIDENT:Nope. ROGERS:&#8211;anything in there.PRESIDENT:Nope. Well, it's, ah, it's hardly anything.Except that Pat Gray; and, now recollects he did get the God damn piece of paper and, he destroyed it, because he was told it was political material, and had nothing to do with Watergate. He says (unintelligible). There's no place in the FBI to (unintelligible) it--it's anunbelievable story.ROGERS:Well, Ehrlichman didn't tell him to destroy it? PRESIDENT:Hell no. Gray went back--Dean didn't give it tohim. (unintelligible) Ehrlichman&#8482;s--and, incidentally, I, ah, I put it hard to Petersen. (Unintelligible) Used your name, and uh, (tapenoise) I talked to Bill Rogers about ityesterday and I had a very (unintelligible) (tape noise) I said, "He looked over this and he said you don' t have much of a case onEhrlichman.&#64258; (Unintelligible/REMOVED) (TapeNoise)ROGERS:That piece of paper didn't have anything onEhrlichman.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.4PRESIDENT:Yeah. (Unintelligible). They're trying likehell to just frighten people to death. (Unintelligible) to send `em to jail and so forth. Strachan--they're trying to break him. I don&#8482;t (unintelligible) telling him he can either be a witness or a defendant. So uh,-- well, uh,the other thing&#352;and I told Haldeman, I said,"Tell him to be a witness."ROGERS:What's happened to Dean? PRESIDENT:They may deal with him. And that's, why I putin that statement, I hope--that's the point. I said, &#64257;Look, I talked to Rogers.&#64258; I said, "Wethink we have a grave problem in giving immunityto the President&#8482;s Counsel. He said "But, suppose that it&#8482;s Dean&#8218;s testimony that we need to get Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Then should we give him imm--, shouldn't we give him immunity?&#64258; I said, "No-- not unless you have corroboration."ROGERS:Well, (unintelligible), what you do, Mr.President on things like that, is you, you say to a fellow, " Well, you&#8482;ve got to--you violated the law. You've got to be indicted. Well consider the help you&#8482;ve given us when it comes to the question of sentence." In other words,you&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. ROGERS:&#8211;hold out the prospect to him, you see. PRESIDENT:Um hmm. But how could you give John Dean, thePresident's Counsel, total immunity--when he's involved? He, he admits involvement throughout.ROGERS:Of course, if, if you gave him immunity&#8211;PRESIDENT:But I&#8211; ROGERSYou&#352;you get&#8211; PRESIDENT:I (unintelligible) said, by no means. I&#8482;d takethe rap (unintelligible).APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.5ROGERS:They'd think that you worked it out so DeanPRESIDENT:Well, they&#8482;re going to s--, Then the other way&#352;the way that Dean&#8482;s people, the U.S. Attorney&#8482;s people&#352;but, Peterson said he agreed with that. "He was trying to convince the U.S. Attorneys of that. But they were hot on trying to give himimmunity (unintelligible). And they want to getHaldeman and Ehrlichman, frankly. As and, and, and they said, and then, I, I--and then (unintelligible) cop out there (unintelligible) (Tape Noise) Why do you think they should go? (unintelligible) on what basis? Here's what wehave in mind. I'll tell you what this statementwas on They're gonna have Magruder in open court eventually. Haven't made the deal with him, either, but they will. (Unintelligible). The question's simply this (unintelligible) plead guity. They're gonna put out a statement in which they will name other, (unintelligible)what they call non-indictable co-conspirators&#352;the names of people that Dean has charged.ROGERS:Yes. PRESIDEIT:That's all (unintelligible with Tape Noise). Hesaid Sirica, otherwise, will ask him questions and he's gonna testify publicly in open courtabout other people. I think that is a hell of aprejudicial thing to do to the rights of an individual--but I don't (unintelligible).ROGERS:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:And I, and I said&#352;and then they said, &#64257;Haldemanand Ehrlichman will not be on that list if you,uh, if they take a leave&#352;if you fire them.&#64258; Isaid, "Are you telling me if I fire them, you won't prosecute 'em?&#64258; "Oh, no, no, but I mean they won&#8482;t be on that list.&#64258; "Because", he said," if they're on that list they'll have to-- " And then they said--Ah, ah, I said, "Well,what are you saying?&#64258; He said, &#64257;Well, we justfelt we. giving you an option, that, that you could ahead of the herd basically, by just letting them go.&#64258; But on the other hand, Bill, I think,APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.6PRESIDENT:I think that whether they're on the list or-CONT.:if I let `em go, they&#8482;re on the list anyway. Itappears that I just--I heard they were going to be on the list and I fired them and they were on it. Then, then it looks as if we&#8482;re not prosecuting. That's my problem. We're, notprosecuting my two top people and I let `em go.I don't think that makes sense at all--or do you agree? I, am I missing something here?ROGERS:You don't seem to. PPESIDENT:Well tell me that&#352;Well, wouldn't it look bad? ROGERSOh, sure.PRESIDENT:Bad.ROGERS:From your standpoint. Yeah. PRESIDENT:If I let Haldeman and Ehrlichman go and theydidn't have them on the list, they will call them before the Grand Jury and then indict them if they get information. Jesus Christ-ROGERS:But if you see, Mr. President, the, the onlyreason a judge questions a defendant whenthere's a plea of guilty&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. ROGERS:&#8211;is to make sure that he's pleadingvoluntarily...PRESIDENT:Yeah.ROGERS&#8211;and that he knows the nature of his plea.PRESIDENT:Now then-- right, right. But Sirica hasexceeded that hasn't he, Bill? That's the point.ROGERS:Well&#8211; PRESIDENT:He's asking now who else was involved. Seethat's what he's gonna ask. "Was he involved?"APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.7ROGERS:It, it seems to me that if he's doing that&#352;-Ithink he'll (unintelligible) McCord.PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s that's what they're saying. ROGERSWell, if, he does that, that's a perversionofthe Grand Jury process. The whole idea of the Grand Jury process is to protect people&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.ROGERS:&#8211;until they&#8482;re indicted. And once they areindicted, then they are presumed to be innocent and then they go to trial. One of the reasons you have a Grand Jury proceeding is so you don&#8482;t have innocent names made news (unintelligible)to the public.PRESIDENT:Well, I'll tell you. Let me put it this way.(Unintelligible/REMOVED). Uh, frankly, I thinkhe's going to beat it. I don't think it's goingto help him, if, if by letting him go I know that he&#8482;s, he's gone to the prosecution.ROGERS:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I told him--ROGERS:You shouldn't--you shouldn't be faced with thoseproblems.PRESIDENT:I know I don't have anybody (unintelligible).Don't you agree with me that, that, that, that was&#352;-that you know, I am concerned about mypeople. I know that Haldeman and Ehrlichman arenot guilty of a God-damn thing. You know what I mean. It's only tangential on that, Bill-- tangential. Sure they knew they were raising money for these God-damn defendants, but they, here they were busy in the campaign. They, Imean, I mean with me, with me&#8211;ROGERS:Yeah.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.8PRESIDENT:Ehrlichman was handling the whole domestic thingand Haldeman was with me all the time. Christ he must have worked (unintelligible). It was all over with Mitchell. Mitchell is the son-of-a- bitch in this whole thing--and frankly, Dean was handling it for White House. (Unintelligible).Our people were aware that he was. We wereaware (unintelligible).ROGERS:How, how did you leave it with Petersen? I don'tknow whether--I think from now on you better let him run with the ball. I don&#8482;t know&#8211;PRESIDENT:I have. I left it with Petersen. He&#8482;s gonnareport to me and I said, "If you get anycorroborative testimony, I&#8482;d like to know." I think that&#8482;s better.ROGERS:Sure. PRESIDENT:And, and if I get some corroborative testimony,I said, "I&#8482;d like to be warned and I can call in my people and say, &#64257;Look, I found this out andI&#8482;ve got information and you, and you--Therefore, you ought toconsider whether you shouldn&#8482;t resign.&#64258; That&#8482;s all I told him. Well, I'm not going yo talk to him any more about that. After all, I&#8482;m the President of the God- damn country--and I'm going to get on with itand meet Italians and Germans and all theseotherRESTRICTED-&#64257;B&#64258;ROGERS:Oh, you do that. I-think you; I think that,uh...PRESIDENT:I've been living with this for, since around the30th of March that's all I've been doing forhalf the time now, you know. Having all these (unintelligible) that I can trust. What trust. I trust Ehrlichnan. I had him working on it. I must say he completed the job. We got to the bottom of the thinq. (Unintelligible) Mitchelland questioned (unintelligible). This is beforeMagruder (unintelligible). And he said there is a possible, possible, uh, situation of the, of the aftermath, of the--what do you call it? Uh-APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.9ROGERS:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENTif the individuals knew that the purpose was tokeep people from talking in, in court&#8211;ROGERS:In court&#8211; PRESMENT:Not openly. Apparently, it&#8482;s, uh--You mightwanta keep &#8218;em from talking--but he said,"Anyway&#64258;, he said, &#64257;that&#8482;s the problem.&#64258; Sowhat the hell. (Unintelligible/REMOVED)Haldeman and his kids, Ehrlichman and Dean andhis kids. You know what I mean? You go home at night (unintelliqible). I&#8482;m thinking of the possibility of their mocking their great career.They&#8482;ve served, this Administration--marvelouslyfor 4 years. Then all of a sudden, shit they're (Unintelligible). I&#8482;ll tell you, they, if they aren&#8482;t convicted, Bill, they'll, they'll come out, you know what I mean. (Unintelligible) charge, and everbody's gonna understand. This'll be in better perspective in a year, Ithink.ROGERS:I think so. I think once that the&#352;well, thefirst brush will be--it, uh&#8211;PRESIDENT:&#8211;terrible ROGERS:&#8211;will be terrible. PRESIDENT:Yes, sir,ROGERS:No doubt about that.PRESIDENT:Oh, Christ yes. ROGERS:Uh, and it will&#352;it has so many littleramificationsPRESIDENT:Yeah. ROGERS:&#8211;to the story,PRESIDENT:Yeah. Right, right.ROGERS:But when it's all finished&#8211;APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.10PRESIDENT:Watergate mess, that's what it is.ROGERS:&#8211;when it&#8482;s all finished--I don't know&#8211; PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). The Jury indicts, moves.We're going to get onwith (unintelligible) this country. A lot of people in the country have, uh&#352;we may find they, theydo know the President's doing the best he can.God damn thing. If I wanted to cover-up&#352;they probably think the President can't cover-up. If I wanted to, I sure haven't done it very well, have I? You can see it&#8211;ROGERS:Not only that (unintelligible) prosecute(unintelligible) your own people.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) prosecuted Mitchell. ROGERS:At any of these times, did he give you anyindication of what he's going to do with (Unintelligible)?PRSIDENT:Make a deal, with both--make a deal with Dean.Yeah, make a deal. I would think with Dean theywould just say, "Look son, if you're indicted,you're coming along.&#64258; "Gee, fellows, what the hell is (unintelligible)" and any of (unintelligible). But he's going to try this whole "Administration I would expect. And my view on that is let him try the wholeAdministration. Ron Ziegler makes aninteresting point. He said, "Dean had, in February, had said, I, for nine months conducted this investigation. Now he comes in and charges co inaction.&#64258; God dammit, why didn't he come in earlier and tell me these things, Bill? Whydidn't he do it? If he knew I would think that&#8211;ROGERS:It's one of those things that I just--(TapeNoise) if they have Mitchell.PRESIDENT:Oh, shit. ROGERS:Well, these things happened.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.11PRESIDENT:And once it did happen, not cutting it off rightthen--stepping forward and saying, &#64257;I flubbed this. These kids shouldn&#8482;t have done this and that&#8482;s not really best judge.&#64258; Good God Almighty, uh, (unintelligible). They just thought that might hurt the election, shit.ROGERS:Same thing is true in Vesco. That case he&#8482;sinvolved in--PRESIDENT:Belongs to the courts I'd rather have it therethan in the Committee.ROGERS:Oh, sure. PRESIDENT:Wouldn't you? At least the court doesn't tryto&#8211;ROGERS:Well, that&#8482;s the way it&#8482;s supposed to be. That&#8482;sthe system. The system is&#8211;PRESIDENT:It sure shows the system works, though, doesn&#8482;tit? I mean, I get Petersen, had him in here all day on Sunday, had him on Monday, I had him here today. I fired out my statement, and I said&#8211;RROGERS:What&#8482;d he say about your statement?PRESIDENT:Petersen? Oh, he thought it was fine. I, I, Igot to thank him for it.ROGERS:Is he willing to (unintelligible) accuse otherpeople in open court?PRESIDENT:A judge like Sirica. (unintelligible).ROGERS:Well, I could see it, I could see--Sirica was,he was suspicious there was a cover-up.PRESIDENT:That's right. Right. ROGERS:He was trying to, he was trying to put pressureon the ones who knew so he could move to&#8211;APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.12PRESIDENT:No only to confess about themselves, but aboutother ones. On that point, of course, they'd say that Magruder has acknowledged, Magruder has confessed--but what about others? What about (unintelligible)?ROGERS:What I mean is here you&#8482;ve got a willingwitness. Before he was doing it to reluctantdefendants. Here you got a willing, as I understand it, a willing witness.PRESIDENT:Who will testify. ROGERS:Who will testify, who's been working with theprosecutor and who's going to, going to, will becalled before the Grand Jury. Why the hellhe's--that (unintelligible) open court. That's the&#352;that&#8482;s what the Grand Jury's for. Makes a nice little backdrop for your Italian dinner, doesn&#8482;t it?PRESIDENT:Oh, it&#8482;ll be alright. They'll have a finedinner (intelligible). They just heard thestory. (Unintelligible) "Thank God, thePresident's finally said something about Watergate.&#64258; That, I think, is going to he the partial reaction.ROGERS:I do too. PRESIDENT:I don't know. I m not taking any&#8211;ROGERS:No. (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:&#8211;comfort out of it, because for a period of timeit's going to be painful. "Mitchell gets (unintelligible). When possibly Haldeman and Ehrlichman gets&#8211;ROGERS:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:They're talking to them now. I've asked themboth to come over here for a minute when they get (unintelligible). I feel frankly that we should. And a question that he makes now which is still open, you see, he still left it open. They, they'll leave if evidence that Deanbrought to my attention&#8211;APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.13ROGERS:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Of course, if I have other sources. Now, if hedoesn't have enough to sink 'em, but he makes these, he's doing enough to sink them, in order to get (unintelligible). Whether or not Haldeman and Ehrlichman ought to wait untiltheir names are publicly brought into this.Magruder shouldn&#8482;t. He said he&#8482;d give us twelve hours notice on that, but I&#352;I think that probably it&#8482;s going to be tomorrow.ROGERS:I think John and Bob should have more time totalk to their lawyer first (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Your immediate reaction, though, is--ROGERS:(Unintelligible) my reaction is I don'tunderstandPRESIDENT:What should I do? ROGERS:&#8211;what the hell they're going to--what, whatMagruder's going to do? I don&#8482;t, uh, it seems to me if Dean has mentioned them that way thatthey ought to them, uh, take a leave of absence.PRESIDENT:Yeah. ROGERS:I don&#8482;t see how&#8211; PRESIDENT:But you would wait until their names werementioned? That's the whole point.ROGERS:Yeah. I don&#8482;t see on what basis can you, youcan do it. Now in the case of&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well, on this basis now. Let&#8482;s say that thePresident had knowledge from the U.S. Attorney that charges had been made against them. But, that me emphasize, I nailed him hard. I said, &#64257;Now let&#8482;s&#352;&#64257; I said, &#64257;Rogers and I read thiswhole thing over. But they&#8482;re uncorroborated.&#64258;He says, &#64257;I agree.&#64258; But he wants me to sack &#8218;em.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.14ROGERS:He can't corroborate it?PRESIDENT:And I have a feeling for a, for a guy that'ssupposed to uphold the right of innocent before (unintelligible) guilty. Well, let me say this. I've got to live with my self. I don't want to do it in that (unintelligible). That isn&#8482;tfair. On the other hand, I&#8482;m trying to think oftheir standpoint. If they're going to get--if they could get some advantage, either&#352;-any advantage by not thereby being named in. in this statement and then, of course not even being indicted. Maybe that's something.ROGERS:That's a decision&#8211;PRESIDENT:But they re gonna&#8211; ROGERS:That's a decision they almost have to make. PRESIDENT:They, they, on the other, hand, they're going tobe called. They&#8482;ll be indicted and called. Although, I guess really appearing as non- indictable co-conspirators&#352;what the hell everthat means (unintelligible).ROGERS:When you have a, a case that&#8482;s serious and youhave people who are on the periphery, and you want to name them, ah, in order to have them available as a witness, you name them as a co- conspirator without indicting them. Well, well,for the common person&#8211;PRESIDENT:&#8211;these guys are available. ROGERS:&#8211;for the common person--that s just as bad asbeing indicted. Expecially, er, (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)ROGERS:You can't clear you name. Uh, in other words,if you&#8482;re indicated, uh, then you have the opportunity to clear the record. Go to trial, get an acquittal, that you (unintelligible) just as if it didn&#8482;t happen. If you&#8482;re named as a co-conspirator and forced to resign, thenyou&#8482;re convicted without a trial.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.15ROGERS:In case I'm not really--you got to protect(CONT&#8482;D)them because I don't--I think probably in thefinal analysis they--I'm afraid, I&#8482;m, afraid Bob is probably in&#8211;PRESIDENT:&#8211;gonna be indicted? ROGERS:&#8211;in trouble. But, ah&#8211;PRESIDENT:I&#8482;m not sure he's indictable.ROGERS:I&#8482;m not sure he'll be indicted but his&#8211; PRESIDENT:Well, staying too close to the money. He nevercan explain that. In terms of legal, uh, involvement though but he could never explain to the people (unintelligible) by Mitchell, by, byDean, (unintelligible) of the defense?ROGERS:Why don't, why don&#8482;t we do this?(Unintelligible)&#352;or, they&#8482;re just talking to lawyers. Well you won&#8482;t have a chance to, to assimilate it. (Unintelligible).PPESIDENT:We11. ROGERS:And if you're going to have tweleve hours.PRESIDENT:Yeah twelve. I would like for you to put yourmind to, to the problem, if you would, because I really think we&#8482;ve got to start helping &#8218;em. Help advise them. They're, they're in the eye of the hurricane.ROGERS:All right. It gives us a little time to see howyour, how your statement plays.PRESIDENT:Always had a suspicion Mitchell had done it(unintelligible) every God-damn thing. (Unintelligible). Always.ROGERS:Oh. PRESIDENT:But that he probably didn't know about&#352;know whatI mean? My feeling was that MitchellAPRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.16PRESIDENT:(CONTINUED):basically always thought Magruder(unintelligible) God-damn thing. Mitchell just wasn't tending the shop. That's what I understand.ROGERS:I&#8482;m surprised about Dean. I thought, I thought&#352;Well from the beginning, I thought Magruder liedand I thought Mitchell, Mitchell probably&#352;he may well have given the go ahead and said, &#64257;Oh yeah, to hell with this,&#64258; and the damn thing was then approved.PRESIDENT:Yeah. "Don't tell me about it."ROGERS"Go ahead. &#64257;Don't tell me. Go ahead and doit.&#64258; Ah, well I&#8482;m surprised about Dean because I didn&#8482;t think&#8211;PRESIDENT:Dean claims that he didn't have anything to dowith having them, with having them go ahead. Understand that&#352;After that Dean came in in terms of the obstruction of justice. There&#8482;s wherehe&#8482;s vulnerable. That&#8482;s all. He&#8482;s not, he&#8482;snot vulnerable on the first part in my opinion. I think he&#8211;ROGERS:From the same position if he&#8482;s gotten two peoplehe&#8482;s trying to bargain with&#352;Deana dd, and Magruder&#352;and he&#352;did he say he got the writtenstatements from both of them?PRESIDENT:I think what they&#8482;ve done is they&#8482;ve sat downand debriefed. That&#8482;s what they call it. (Unintelligible) with an agreement certainly, though. Where Dean is concerned, nothing they can do to shake him. On that one he standsfirm.ROGERS:(Unintelligible) I would think that the onefellow that had to know about this and, uh, should take a leave of absence is Dean.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) what about his(unintelligible)? It looks like he's thescapegoat (unintelligible) set him off.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.17ROGERS:We don&#8482;t.PRESIDENT:&#8211;worse than he is. ROGERS:Well I think your point is true enough. Heappears to be an underling, although he&#8211;PRESIDENT:He was the one. ROGERS:Pretty hard to, pretty hard to say, the lawyersfor the&#8211;PRSIDENT:Well he was--he was not. Not in this matter, Ican assure you. He handled the whole thing. He was depending upon--directing, in fact, when I started my investigation on the 21st of March. Isaw Dean at least three times. At Camp David,he was to write the son-of-a-bitch up so wecould put out a statement. He said, &#64257;I really can&#8482;t write a statement that you can put out.&#64258; That&#8482;s, so I must say, I&#8482;ve done everything I can to get to the bottom, Bill, as you can see. I said, I said, &#64257;John, you got to let it all hang out--now find out--you got to tell me whatthe hell the score is so we&#8482;ll know how to dealwith this. We&#8482;re not going to be nibbled to death by a thousand, you know, uh, hurts.&#64258; That&#8482;s, that&#8482;s exactly what we&#8482;ve done. So we&#8482;ve got just as--the time when McCord, which I, I (unintelligible). There are--at least,he&#8482;s made a lot of allegations hat he--are nottrue. But there&#8482;s enough there that would put anybody on notice that without a doubt there&#8482;s something wrong.ROGERS:Yeah. PRESIDENT:That's why I had to move and I have&#352;at least Iproduced&#352;good-- I thought the statement shouldreveal that I have been working on the son-of-a- bitch since the twenty-first of March.ROGERS:What are we doing? &#64257;(Unintelligible) why don&#8482;twe&#352;why don&#8482;t we not meet any more tonight and then&#8211;APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.18ROGERS:(Unintelligible). In the, in the, in the realsense, it&#8482;s up to the&#352;it&#8482;s up to John and Bob.PRESIDENT:Yeah. ROGERS:It&#8482;s damn difficult for anybody else who doesn&#8482;tknow what the hell he&#8482;s talking about. For example, I don&#8482;t really know. you know, what thefacts are.PRESIDENT:Yeah. ROGERS:I, I, I&#8211; PRESIDENT:I&#8482;m not sure that I know. ROGERS:You don&#8482;t either. So it&#8482;s very difficult forothers whose judgement tends to be superficial.Although those are sophisticated fellows--John,after all, is a lawyer, so he claims that he&#8482;s (unintelligible), a thoughtful kind of a fellow, and he isn&#8482;t, isn&#8482;t shaken now, isn&#8482;t a fellow that&#8482;s just a rambling idiot.PRESIDENT:Yeah--he&#8482;s taking hold. Had everybody over thismorning. Going to fight, discredit Dean--discredit the prosecutor, you know, ah, going tofight. That&#8482;ll be one hell of a little fight but (unintelligible) the Administration (Unintelligible).ROGERS(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Dean's pissed off.(Tape Noise)ROGERS:(Unintelligible). You don't expect the head ofthe FBI to pick up and burn the God-damn stuff. You can put it in your safe and say it is unrelated to the investigation. But, burn it, makes you look like a common crook.PRESIDENT:We&#8482;re working as hard as we can. The guy we&#8482;rethinking of, Bill (unintelligible) a Democrat, Irish, Catholic, bachelor, 42 years of age.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.19PRESIDENT:(CONTINUED):He&#8482;s finishing the Ellsberg case and receivedplaudits for being just as fair as he can. Thank God there&#8482;s a jurist of that kind. And based on (unintelligible). And I did, I think he&#8482;d get a hundred percent because he has, ah,he has investigative experience. A great manfor the job.ROGERS:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:He&#8482;ll get a hundred votes in the Senate.(Unintelligible). &#64257;Why did you burn it?&#64258; Wouldn&#8482;t you say, &#64257;There&#8482;s no place in the FBI.We have nothing to do with politics. This ispolitical material. Turned it over to us, showed it to us because they wanted to be sure they weren&#8482;t suppressing anything it (unintelligible). (Unintelligible) Thought the best thing to do was the--FBI first.&#64258;HALDEMAN:Do you want us or not?PRESIDENT:Ah&#352;-sure, come on in, then.ROGERS:I was just saying to the President I thoughtmaybe we oughta wait until overnight. (Unintelligible) the two of you (unintelligible) just not feeling (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:We talked to your Mr. Wilson. He&#8482;s a fine chap.(Unintelligible)UNIDENTIFIED:Wilson? An old-timer? HALDEMAN:Nothing like&#352;contrary to your feeling that wewouldn&#8482;t want to work with him, I, I think we&#8482;ll find him very good&#8211;ROGERS:and tough.EHRLICHMAN:He&#8482;s very knowledgeable. HALDEMAN:Sharp as hell. Technically, he&#8482;s, he&#8482;s old,but, but mentally he&#8482;s, he&#8482;s&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;very bright. PRESIDENT:Just let me say, I&#8482;m so glad that you have a--somebody to talk to. I definitely&#8211;APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.20ROGERS:My only reservation would be (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Well, that's a problem. If we go to trial, he&#8482;sgonna be able&#352;he&#8482;s got a heart problem and all that so you can't&#8211;PRESIDENT:You, you don't need a trial lawyer&#8211; HALDEMAN:We need brains right now.PRESIDENT:What you need is brains, judgement.EHRLICMMAN:Well, he knows the cast of characters. He knowsPetersen. He knows Glanzer. He knows all these people and, uh...HALDEMAN:&#8211;and he already despises them. EHRLICHMAN:All the people we don't like.(Laughter)HALDEMAN:Maybe he started out that way before we said,anything.ROGERS:Well, I'm glad because I was worried about his(unintelligible). I gave&#8211;PRESIDENT:Bill has a, Bill brought&#352;incidentally, ah, Iasked him about it again, how he liked theGarment approach. And he said, &#64257;No problem.&#64258;We should go with him. I told him this is the only question you see, (unintelligible), I don&#8482;t have anybody to talk to. I&#8482;m not gonna talk to Petersen any more. That&#8482;s done, and I&#352; except, except to suck all, all the informationI often got from him. You know what I mean.EHRLICHMAN:Wilson said to us, he said, "Be ware ofPetersen. He talks.&#64258; He said, uh, he cited a case that he had that Petersen was involved in&#8211;HALDEMAN:And he said that one problem in dealing with himwas that every point he makes is accompained bya story, and that (unintelligible).APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.21PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). Well, then maybe I'll, allI'll do with Petersen--he said that he'd give me 12 hours notice with regard to the Magruder thing and I think I want that.HALDEMAN:Yeah, okay. PRESIDENT:Bill doesn&#8482;t know what the hell that, how thatprocedure works&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Let me tell you what that is. Wilson explainedthat to us, too. He said that where a man goes in on an information, and pleads guilty, in this District, it is customary for the judge to interrogate if he wishes to. And also for thereto be filed a, a statement of the case, uh, inthe nature of the information. Now the information which they will file, instead of an indictment, names co-conspirators in the conspiracy charge who are not indicted. That does not mean that you won&#8482;t be indicted later. It means for the purpose of that informationwhich is then filed, your are not indicted. Andso this is a list of people who in, in a description of a conspiracy pattern are co- conspirators. His analysis of the pros and cons of this are--that for the prosecutor to come forward and say, &#64257;If you&#8482;ll suspend thesebirds, I will name them in the list of co-conspirators,&#64258; gets the prosecutor off a difficult political hook. Because when the judge asks, &#64257;Where there any other co- conspirators and, and so on?&#64258; He can say, Well, they have already been suspended, ah,&#8211;PRESIDENT:B-but...EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and may be indicted.&#64258; Now, we reserve the rightto indict them but we are going to have them before the Grand Jury.ROGERS:So, are they going to help a bit? EHRLICHMAN:Well, this is, it doesn't help us.PRESIDENT:That's -the point&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:It helps the prosecutor with his problem. Onthe other hand, he says there's a, there is aAPRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.22EHRLICHMAN:(CONTINUED):certain negative in it, from a political:standpoint for the Administration in that the question will arise, "Well, why weren&#8482;t their names on there if they're co-conspirators?"PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:Somebody's covering up.ROGERS:Yes. That's, it. HALDEMAN:That&#8482;s, that' s worse than puttin' them on thelist.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, and so, uh, he said&#8211; ROGERS:I don't know, John. And let me go back, forjust a moment on this procedure. Theinformation a is filed by the prosecutor himself, without a, without a Grand Jury action?HALDEMAN:Yeah. ROGERS:Ah, if, if the, prosecutor names, for allpractical purposes, he's convicted &#8218;en.PRESIDENT:That's right.ROGERS:&#8211;particularly in the&#8211;PRESIDENT:&#8211;in the public mind. ROGERS:Particularly that you are going to leave publicservices&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:That's what Wilson said. HALDEMAN:That's what Wilson said.PRESIDENT:If they are indicted.ROGERS:Well, you've been indicted. PRESIDENT:That' s right. ROGERS:Of course. EHRLICHMAN:They could list you as, list you as a co-conspirator, don't call you to the Grand Jury,don't file, ah, don't take an indictment againstyou...HALDEMAN:&#8211;force the President to suspend you and&#8211;APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.23ROGERS:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Let&#8482;s face it. ROGERS:The indictment, Bob, is a charge--theindictment&#8211;PRESIDENT:It 'doesn't convict anybody. ROGERS:What the Constitution provides is that beforecharges (unintelligible) a group of citizens canview the evidence.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;in secret. ROGERS:In secret. To see if there is sufficientevidence to make a public charge against them.PRESIDENT:Yup.ROGERS:That's the protection that everybody has. Ah,if there is an exception and I guess there is in this case, the lesser crime would be this case, the lesser crime would be the result. But, I think, in this case the gravity is such that that&#8482;s all baloney. That&#8482;s alright for somebody stealing automobile (unintelligible) from thesidewalk or something but, know, people in, inpublic positions (uninte11ligible) are entitled to the protection of the Grand Jury. Because if they, they want to make a public charge against an individual-- present it to the Grand Jury. (Unintelligible). That's, the system. But hereyou have a perversion of the system.EHURLICHMAN:Sure. ROGERS:If you're named in an information&#8211; PRESIDENT:Bill,&#8211; ROGERS:&#8211;defintely keeps the government, hell, as far asyou're concerned, you're both concerned you&#8482;re&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Bill,&#8211;ROGERS:&#8211;guilty. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. They have this, they have this capacityby using that process. They could ruin you and never give you a day in court.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.24ROGERS:Of courseEHRLICHMAN:They could list you as, list you as a co-conspirator, don&#8482;t call you to the Grand Jury, don&#8482;t file, ah, don&#8482;t take an indictment against you&#8211;.HALDEMAN:&#8211;force the President to suspend you and&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and you&#8482;re cooked forever. You&#8482;re aconspirator in the Watergate case.ROGERS:Publicly, as far as the public is concerned, youare indicted even if they don&#8482;t call it that.EHRLICHMAN:That&#8482;s right. ROGERS:The president has been forced to have you leave.EHRLICHMAN:It&#8482;s non-actionable. It&#8482;s privileged. Youcan&#8482;t sue for slander.HALDEMAN:We do have a public record in that regardthough, in that we have a public position which commands substantial attention.ROGERS:(Unintelligible) you see that&#352;see, Bob, see, theprotection of the Grand Jury gives the citizenis that first the charge is heard in public.HALDEMAN:That&#8482;s right. To turn this around. ROGERS:And then the charge--then, then everybody shutsup. The evidence is not disclosed. Nobody says a word and the Judge cautions everybody to take the responsibility (unintelligible) you go totrial. And everything is then controlled by therules of evidence. The, then the, the Jury makes a decision based on the evidence. That&#8482;s the system. Now if you do it the other way, you don&#8482;t get the trial. You both would be indicted and convicted in public, by the public,beforehand.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.25EHRLICHMAN:That's a tough political call--that we framed upthere in this conversation, we don&#8482;t need to decide here beyond mentioning it, but it&#8482;s something that will have to be decided. Our relationship to Dean probably was client to attorney. Because we were already doing some--present in all these transactions. What I saidto Dean and what Dean said to me in private conversation with no third party present--could be a (Unintelligible) of privilege. The question is, if requested to by the prosecutor, would we waive the privilege? It is that Deanconversation where he says he came and told methat Liddy had confessed.PRESIDENT:But he did it in California, didn't he? EHRLICHMAN:Well, the, the only reason to tell me was notfor me as me but because I was one of the two conduits that he had to his boss. He didn&#8482;t have, I mean, the organizational set-up was thatway.HALDEMAN:The President&#8482;s log is very interesting. I&#8482;veonly gotten through August, but from the time of the Watergate break-in until the end of August when he signed your bills, uh, signed your notes, in the office, you never saw John Dean.PRESIDENT:So that's, of courser something that(unintelligible).HALDEMANDuring July and August the President had nocommunication with Dean at all.EHRLICHMAN:Now, he gave a lot of legal advice about thiscase. (Unintelligible) and all that, butthere's also, uh, uh&#352;developed a poorrelationship and sooner or later the President is going to have to decide whether he wants to assert his privilege-&#352;if Dean becomes&#8211;PRESIDENT:My privilege&#352;uh, lawyer-client privilege? EHRLICHMAN:Yes. In Dean&#8482;s communications to me and mycommunications to him. And the same with Bob.I think that&#8482;s a tough problem. You probably won't want to reserve it.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.26PRESIDENT:I&#8482;ll take a look. (Unintelligible). What toyou think about that?ROGERS:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:It&#8482;s probably the first time it&#8482;s come up(unintelligible) (laughter) in this setting (unintelligible) uh, Mr. Wilson (unintelligible)think about that awhile.HALDEMAN:Great old guy. EHRLICHMAN:He was at the White a House once before. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:The Dixon-Yates thing. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) budget (unintelligible) Herefused (unintelligible)EHRLICHMANCanal is open. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) he stayed at the White Housefor several months.ROGERS:My only, thought on (unintelligible/REMOVED) atall. (Unintelligible/REMOVED)EHRLICHMAN:I, I, I, I think--ROGERS:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Yeah. ROGERS:Well, what it, what it really means is&#352;it ishard to understand, but, uh, he was Counsel to you as well as to the President.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah. I, I appreciate what you&#8482;re sayingand that&#8482;s that is important, and I understand.ROGERS:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Dean? He dealt with one of us.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.27EHRLICHMAN:It&#8482;s our capacity to make decision.(Unintelligible/REMOVED) an advisor in thatsituation. (Unintelligible) an advisor in thatsituation. (Unintelligible) and sometimes he followed and sometimes he didn&#8482;t.PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s common. (Unintelligible) place.HALDEMAN:Yeah.ROGERS:Trouble is, (unintelligible). Although(unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) ROGERS:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:Sure that&#8482;s right and I deferred to him.UNIDENTIFIED:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Well hell, I deferred to him in this damnedinvestigation. (Tape Noise) I remember you said, &#64257;I think you ought to talk to John Dean.&#64258; Remember. And I hauled him in here. And, Christ, I (unintelligible) ad infinitum and carted him off to Camp David.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) I deferred to him onmostoccasions.ROGERS:Well, don't think it over tonight? I, I,&#8211; PRESIDENT:Well, let&#8482;s, let&#8482;s part with one thing. I don&#8482;tsee anything to be gained be the, uh, procedure of Haldeman and Ehrlichman. You see, here&#8482;s theproblem (unintelligible). Kleindienst, Bill, onSunday&#352;they both came in and said, &#64257;Because of Haldeman and Ehrlichman&#352;-just the fact that, they&#8482;re (unintelligible) ah, both of these clowns, uh, you know implicated that they ought to resign. They haven&#8482;t served you well, Mr.President,&#64258; and (unintelligible).ROGERS:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:They said, Make them resign, resign, resign,&#64258; Isaid, Well, God damn it, I can&#8482;t do it on uncorroborated testimony.&#64258; The point is--think-- a moment of truth for them when theyAPRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.28PRESIDENT:(CONTINUED):come "in--and say they&#8482;ve got corroborativetestimony. Do I have to examine the God-damned testimony? I say "Look, fellows, I think under these circumstances, you had better voluntarily say that, uh--.&#64258; See what I mean? That&#8482;s whatI, that&#8482;s my concern, I don&#8482;t (Tape Noise) Billmade the point that a-person in public office should have no more and no less rights than a person out of a public office. That's, that's my theory. Right, Bill?HALDEMAN:Well, there is a good counter argument which isthat a person in public office has a higherobligation than a person not in public office. This is (unintelligible).ROGERS:I think, though, that matter is for theindividual to decide (unintelligible). That in effect (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I think that if we turned up in this crazyinformation&#352;junk--even though we are not chargedwith a crime, and in the ultimate sense--I could write you a letter and say that due to these charges, that obviously I don&#8482;t want to impair your situation and I am going to take a leave.PRESIDENT:You con1d say I have asked you to put me onleave until the charges are cleared up.EHRLICHMAN:Sure, and I think that is the way, directionfrom which it ought to come.PRESIDENT:I personally think that, that's really thecourse of action we should take and let them, let them, let them put it out if they want to bethat way. And if they do, because you&#8482;re angryyou immediately say, &#64257;I am, ah, I am confident that these charges will not stand up and that I, that I, and so forth.&#64258; That I--and, &#64257;My usefulness, of course, will be seriously impaired and I therefore request a leave untilthe matter is cleared up.&#64258; I think that&#8482;s--Ithink we can all agree on the respect.ERLICHMAN:I might put a&#8211; PRESIDENT:It's like an indictment.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.29EHRLICHMAN:...put a P.S. on there and say, "I am shockedwith the procedure followed and when I am reinstated I am going to see to it that the Justice Department changes its procedure.&#64258;ROGERS:If, if the prosecutor came to the President (unintelligible) and advanced sufficientevidence, for you to ask then to resign, and helooks at that evidence and says, "I, I agree&#64258; (unintelligible). But in this kind of a case, not that, normally, that kind of a judgement wouldn&#8482;t, wouldn&#8482;t mean indictment&#352;that&#8482;s all we have (unintelligible) in effect, Dean would bedoing a greater disservice to you than abonafide Grand Jury indictment.PRESIDENT:That's right, he would. ROGERS:He&#8482;s working for and was already decided before(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:think that&#8211; ROGERS:&#8211;could come on the case.PRESIDENT:&#8211;I think that before you have your day in court.That really means something to me.ROGERS:Well, if, if you were to resolve, pick theresult (unintelligible) Attorney General, that&#8482;s a different matter, Mr. President. I don&#8482;t--the thing I think is--based on what Petersen gave tothe President, which I looked at, I don&#8482;t, Idon&#8482;t think there&#8482;s sufficient there. There may be something I don&#8482;t know about. (Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Well, I put those to Wilson and, uh, he said,&#64257;Well (unintelligible).&#64258; You know, his reactionwas&#8211;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).ROGERS:(Unintelligible/REMOVED) said that you hadmeetings (unintelligible).APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.30PRESIDENT:Yeah.ROGERS:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:That's what Dean's saying. ROGERS:And then, after that&#8211; PRESIDENT:That cannot be (unintelligible), Bill. ROGERS:Well even, supposing you had said that. Supposeyou said that. Then, then there wasn&#8482;t&#352;then, itisn&#8482;t what ya say, it&#8482;s what, it&#8482;s what ya did that&#8482;s&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. ROGERS:So, what, what did they do? Well, they turnedall, everything in the safe over to the FBI.They turned over the materials dealing with theWatergate to the agents that were investigating it, they turned over other material that did not relate to the Watergate and was not under investigation to the dead of the FBI. Now how in hell can you say that&#8482;s obstruction of justice, to turn over all the evidence to the FBI?PRESIDENT:Except that when Pat Gray burned it, it makes itlook it&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) "Deep Six.&#64258; PRESIDENT:And (unintelligible) ROGERS:Well not, Pat Gray, I mean (unintelligible) PatGray was told to do that. He said that that&#8482;s(unintelligible)--PRESIDENT:He was not told to do that.(REEL 2 BEGINS)ROGERS:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:On the other business, which is very suspiciousand that&#8482;s the business of &#64257;should he leave thecountry,&#64258; I&#8482;ve checked with everybody in thatmeeting and they don&#8482;t remember anything like that. It turns out Dean called Liddy and told him to have Hunt leave the country. Colson recalls Dean mentioning this to him, no in my office,APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.31EHRLICHMAN:and Colson saying to Dean, &#64257;The stupid bastard,(CONTINUED)what a terrible mistake.&#64258; And then it wascountermanded, so I&#8211;(END of REEL 1)HALDEMAN:&#8211;and he didn&#8482;t leave the country. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and he didn't leave the country. And so I suspectthat Dean may have acted unilaterally on that.PRESIDENT:Here again&#8211; HALDEMAN:Colson brought him up short.PRESIDENT:Here he&#8482;s trying to pass this up to Ehrlichman,too.EHRLICHMAN:Well, he&#8482;s going to have an explanation for why hedid it.PRESIDENT:But is that going to come out from the others ifthey said, &#64257;He was told to leave the country?&#64258;&#352;Oh, look, Hunt&#8482;s already said it.EHRLICHMAN:Well, yeah. There&#8482;s no, there&#8482;s no question thathe got orders from Liddy who said that, &#64257;myprincipals?&#64258; and he said, &#64257;John Dean.&#64258;PRESIDENT:John Dean said, "Oh no, it's Ehrlichman." EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. (Tape Noise) get into one of these "hesaid&#64258;, &#64257;I said&#64258; (unintelligible). It's going to be miserable. But the probabilities (unintelligible) surrounding circumstances at least as of now--look (unintelligible) Now I now I (unintelligible)illusions about this process, when you get a testof credibilities. Everybody gets used up. There is nothing left at the end of that. So you just have to, you just have to expect that, that, that&#8482;s the end of the ball game.PRESIDENT:Well, it is for this time,(unintelligible/REMOVED). The three, the three-fifty thing is the toughest thing, Bob,(unintelligible). Mainly, to me there&#8482;s noquestion about it, whether it&#8482;s been justbasically, that, that they had knowledge that it was going to go to the defendants and so forth. They wanted it for that purpose. And the question is what you thought it was. And then, then they&#8482;ll say that they don&#8482;t believe you. That&#8482;s what it-- down to that.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.32(10 Seconds Unintelligible/REMOVED)PRESIDENT:There again, though, course they have a routethrough this (unintelligible/REMOVED).

It&#8482;s -- possibly we may ask your advice tomorrow with all&#8211;ROGERS:I have reason to feel that you got John Wilson.HALDEMAN:We sure appreciate your help. ROGERS:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:He was enormously gratified to hear that you hadrecommended him.HALDEMAN:We told him that you had suggested him and itwas the only name you could suggest and he said,that, "Well, Bill and I have been on the sameside and on opposite sides. He wouldn&#8482;t speak to me on one matter."EHRLICHMAN:It was on the Swiss deal-- HALDEMAN:That's right it, something he wouldn&#8482;t speak tome (unintelligible) never (unintelligible)worked over here three days a week and never sawPresident Eisenhower. Never got an authographed picture and so we said, &#64257;We thought maybe in this case that could be arranged.(Laughter)APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.33PRESIDENT:Provided he had nothing to do with Watergate!(Laughter)EHRLICHMAN:Well obviously this guy is very clean. HALDEMAN:By the looks of it. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well, so are you, God damn it. ROGERS:Okay. Good bye, Mr. President.EHRLICHMAN:See you a little later. Thank, you, bye.PRESIDENT:I&#8482;m glad he feels good about having the lawyer-- HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Very good lawyer. HALDEMAN:Yeah. I, I don&#8482;t know about John. I don&#8482;t knowanything about lawyers. I never had one before,so. For exactly the reasons that, Bill thoughtwe wouldn&#8482;t like him&#352;he&#8482;s on old man and we won&#8482;t like working&#352;I do like him.PRESIDENT:Now o1d is he? Seventy? HALDEMAN:Seventy-two. PRESIDENT:Well, he's well-preserved. HALDEMAN:He's, he's had some, you know, he hasdifficulties (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Very exceptional mind. HALDEMAN:But I&#8482;ll tell you the guy has got--his mindisn&#8482;t slow at all. He does have the problem of having to go back and tell ya stories.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). Yeah. I don't, I don't -- Ifeel very good about him.PRESIDENT:Well, it's good to have him. Very good. This isa fight.HALDEMAN:I need&#352;a--he is so devoted to the other things.He's just devoted to the cause. He said, hesaid, "It's a great honor to meet, meet youmen." (Unintelligible)APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.34PRESIDENT:What is his reaction to the whole God-damnthing? Comedy, tragedy? Tragedy of errors?HALDEMAN:He didn&#8482;t, he didn&#8482;t, he didn&#8482;t characterize it.(Telephone rings) He didn&#8482;t, ah--PRESIDENT:(Pick up phone) Hello. Oh you&#8482;ve been busy?Yeah. How&#8482;s, how&#8482;d it go? The 21st, rather.Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, for later. That&#8482;s right.Either way. That&#8482;s right. (Unintelligible) Well, get a question about whether, it matters, whether I talked to Mitchell. Huh? Yeah, that&#8482;s right, Mitchell. But there was a, there was a time, they&#8482;ll say, did ya ever, duringthis period, from the 21st on, did you talk toMitchell? Very good. (Unintelligible). Very good, good answer-- All right, Ron Good luck. (Hangs up phone). Well (unintelligible). I just feel that, that, I feel that, I mean I just couldn&#8482;t do that. Now they may (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I tell ya. I think you've put him in a, you&#8482;veput him in a box on that. They are going to have to have some damn good reason for that, that Sirica thing.PRESIDENT:Dean's credibility is totally destroyed, youknow.HALDEMAN: Dean (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Sure, Dean (unintelligible) charge of theinvestigation.EHRLICHMAN:Did they ask him that? PRESIDENT:Yes. I put it up to Ron and (unintelligible).I made this point to Ron. I said, &#64257;You knowDean unintelligible) the White House, theAdministration, and so forth.&#64258; (Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:That's a good statement, if I say so. HALEDMAN:It is good. It puts you, no, it puts youexactly in the position that you should be innow.PRESIDENT:We&#8482;ll get the shit kicked out of us by the presson it.HALDEMAN:&#8211;for giving in on and so forth.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.35PRESIDENT:Oh, giving in on Ervin, well, oh Ervin&#8211;HALDEMAN:Why do you think they&#8482;ll kick&#8211; PRESIDENT:Oh Ervin, oh, no, oh Ervin&#8482;s great&#352;hell, thatdoesn&#8482;t that doesn&#8482;t bother me a bit. I was always ready to give in on Ervin and I said, &#64257;This is very satisfactory now. I think we&#8482;venow accomplished our purpose. This is a gooddeal.&#64258; I said, &#64257;It not only applies to this case but it can apply to other (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:I ad libbed that when I said it. I worked itin. But, no, I meant to get the shit kicked outof the press. But, uh, &#64257;why did the presidentact so late on this case? Why didn&#8482;t he act earlier on this matter? He had the charges floating around.&#64258; The answer is that they are, they were charges that were just floating, I think. I mean, really, that&#8482;s true, there were newspaper charges and so forth.EHRLICHMAN:Well, (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) relying on Dean, frankly. HALDEMAN:Well, then speed was not of the essence in thiscase. It wasn&#8482;t a matter of where whereby moving quickly you would stop something. It was done. It was a matter now of doing it properly.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Not quickly. (Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) do what&#8482;s right fellas. Youknow, that&#8482;s the point, on that, the whole Garment thing. But, ah, there is this tendency John, to talk, and basically I, I thought(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Totally non-plussed by that. He said, &#64257;Where&#8482;sthe Attorney General?&#64258; He&#8482;s taken himself out of it. (Unintelligible) the Deputy Attorney General? He&#8482;s not involved in it. Where&#8482;s the Chief District Attorney? Where&#8482;s Titus whoshould be on top of this? Why did Silbert callme instead of Titus? (Unintelligible) There&#8482;s a (unintelligible) of old boys from theAPRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.36HALDEMAN:Justice Department. Silbert, he&#8482;s an old(CONT.)boy from the Justice Department, and others, andthey band together.&#64258; He said, &#64257;Did John Dean ever work for the Justice Department?&#64258; He also said, &#64257; I bet you those lawyers that Dean has and Magruder has both were old JusticeDepartment types.&#64258; He says that Glanzer is avery bad operator. He knows him well. He doesn&#8482;t know Silbert, be knows Glanzer well.EHRLICHMAN:He knows Glanzer very well. HALDEMAN:Says he's a Bad guy. (Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Well, don&#8482;t you both agree though, John, Bob?HALDEMAN:He did it. But I would argue with the, the L.A.Times leak this morning. (Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I knew about that leak, ah, it was going to comeyesterday.HALDEMAN:No, I don&#8482;t think it was intended as that. AndI don&#8482;t--not because it triggered us, but because it set the stage. It, It, let out aheadof time that the White House was going to moveon something, And then, by God, you did.PRESIDENT:Well, did that story say the White House wasgoing to move? Oh, oh, oh. Heads are going to roll. That probably, that probably came directly from Dean. I think Dean did that.HALDEMAN:&#64257;White House likely to admit some Watergateresponsibility-&#352;will make a dramatic admission on one or more high level officials, bear responsibility.&#64258; It doesn&#8482;t say White House officials. Now, uh, uh, uh, your action now, saying something, you know, substantialdevelopments, and then when the Mitchell bombbreaks, that&#8482;s all going to fit together rather, rather well.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.37PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah (unintelligible/REMOVED).HALDEMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) make out. Tell us about thattransaction and (unintelligible. (Unintelligible). It&#8482;s about not letting (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:He said, he said it was the 22,000, was thedifference in money material, into the case (unintelligible. Did he keep the money or was there something (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well, he called the same day, too, didn&#8482;t he? HALDEMAN:Called the next day. He called within twenty-four hours.EHRLICHMAN:That was the next day. Testified on Thursdayand called on Friday. (Tape Noise) They are using every lever they can lay their hands on&#352; these guys that say that.HALDEMAN:I saw on ABC News tonight, which also fits intoall this, possibly. It says &#64257;in he last threeweeks in the White House, Haldeman has beencoming down very hard telling everybody if you have anything to say, say it now. This was the message that was given to Mitchell Saturday at the White House. Haldeman evinced no protection and no apologies. Anyone and everything will bedisclosed.&#64258; It, it should have been Ehrlichmaninstead of Haldeman, or get out White House (unintelligible) for cracking down hard on the Watergate.PRESIDENT:That's not bad. HALDEMAN:It&#8482;s a damned good position to be in. And whenZiegler talked to him he says, &#64257;I can&#8482;t give youanything official on that but I can tell you off the record you are not going off base.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.38PRESIDENT:Bill Gill was on last night?HALDEMAN:No tonight. Gill called and asked forconfirmation. Oh, said he was going with the story and he wanted Ziegler&#8482;s comment. Ziegler said, &#64257;I can&#8482;t give you any comment.&#64258;PRESIDENT:The story probably isn&#8482;t even on.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Well, that&#8482;s what I said to Ron, &#64257;Hold thestatement until tomorrow, and looked up my story (unintelligible) was on. No. It will be on. It&#8482;s on. There&#8482;s another item.PRESIDENT:The right day too. We had to get it out.(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:That&#8482;s right. That&#8482;s right. The Post won&#8482;t putit in tomorrow. If the Post had something to go with tomorrow, I would say they wouldn&#8482;t go. They&#8482;ll hold up now and watch for&#352;they&#8482;re&#352; playing the long game. (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) your point, John, about the(unintelligible), I think we, I think we have,we&#8482;ve, we&#8482;ve sped the process up. We&#8482;re takin&#8482; a hell of a deep big cut. But this kind of, this, this kind of stuff here would have had stories for three or four months.HALDEMAN:That&#8482;s right.PRESIDENT:That Ervin. Right.HALDEMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:We get into the Grand Jury and then they get anindictment.EHRLICHMAN:Well, there's no question that it&#8482;s the best waycompared to the&#352;better than the Ervin process.It&#8482;s absolutely essential to go it this way.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.39PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:If it weren&#8482;t for the fact (unintelligible)possibility of indictments and so forth, it&#8482;s been my theory (unintelligible) this God-damn thing to the Grand Jury.EHRLICHMAN:Yep.HALDEMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:And ah, you know, I mean, and not, the&#8211; HALDEMAN:We have to face the possibility of indictmentsand those would, those would have come anyway. They wouldn&#8482;t have let you get away with(unintelligible)&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well I think what would happen really,(unintelligible) with Ervin&#8482;s problem, (unintelligible) I, we refer this to the Grand Jury.EHRLICHMAN:They&#8482;d have murdered you. HALDEMAN:Then they&#8482;d be out every night on television&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:They'd have murdered youHALDEMAN:&#8211;demanding that you fire everybody and demandingthat you do that and that.EHRLICHMAN:Well&#8211; HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) that anyway. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;as a matter of fact, you might have turned theset on some day and watched your White HouseCounsel crap&#352;for the glorious television &#338;as a complete surprise to you.HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Oh, (unintelligible) you got the(unintelligible)?APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.40HALDEMAN:Sure. He pulls it up there.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible). I would suggest that youimmediately approve a new White House counsel. I have a candidate.PRESIDENT:Good. EHRLICHMAN:And that&#8482;s this guy Thompson who tried Kerner,(tape noise) high corruption. He&#8482;s tough,bright, dedicated to public service, attractive, clean.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:He&#8482;s tried (unintelligible) three cases thisyear. He tried the Kerner case &#338;that&#8482;s what&#8482;sgonna help him politically.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:No. Would he be loyal to the President? EHRLICHMAN:He&#8482;s, he&#8482;s, he&#8482;s got every reason to be. I&#352;hewas here today which is what made me think of him. Big, tall, good-looking guy, very robust. But, he&#8482;s also just gives Daley fits because ofhis anti-corruption stand. He&#8482;s the nation&#8482;sleading corruption cleaner-outer at the moment. And he would be, he seemed to, to, to personify a new broom sweeping clean.PRESIDENT:Could he be the director of the FBI? EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah, he could.PPESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:He&#8482;s worth waiting for but if you don&#8482;t want towait, you sure could go with this guy. He runs a great big office. There&#8482;s 70 lawyers or something like that.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.41HALDEMAN:It isn't, the point, though, is I know you don tthink it's important, but the White House counsel is important.PRESIDENT:Sure, oh, oh no, of course I know it'simportant.HALDEMAN:He&#8482;s important at this, this, the uh, when itfalls apart like this you see the importance.He handles a hell of a lot of stuff&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:&#8211;on, on our behalf that is important if it goeswrong and it&#8482;s totally insignificant as long as it goes right.PRESIDENT:Now, let&#8482;s face it, up to this thing, Deanhandled a lot of stuff well.HALDEMAN:That&#8482;s right. Yes. EHRLICHMAN:I would, I would hate to have you appear in theposition of not have&#352;of sort of conditionally holding the job open much beyond the time that Dean is&#8211;PRESIDENT:I'll say, this. I think that one thing forsure, John, is (unintelligible, with tape noise) I would, ah, I think that I&#8482;ve got to play, I want to play&#352;I know the Dean thing very well&#352;we have played it pretty, fairly well. I think what we ought to do&#352;make or deal or not withDean this week. (Unintelligible) in allcertainty (unintelligible). His, I don&#8482;t see how Dean can possibly miss being in whatever they put out on Magruder.HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:He can't miss being in it. And the way this guytalks, I think all of you, all of you, everybody(unintelligible).APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.42EHRLICHMAN:He may get it. We&#8482;ll just have Mr. Wilson goaround and talk with the U.S. Attorney types. (Unintelligible), and say, &#64257;Okay, you are about to, you&#8482;re about to ruin these guys. I just want you to know that they are going to have to go out and protect themselves. You&#8482;ll have, youare going to be, you&#8482;re going to be, you&#8482;regoing to be in a problem.&#64258; (Unintelligible) I mean. He has quite a close relationship with Titus. (Unintelligible) get much of a total on this. This statement, and he&#8482;s going to make it, make it any thing he can--make a(unintelligible) press for--not immunity, butfunctional immunity, so-called, where he doesn&#8482;t need to make a side deal with the boys and they can grant immunity. And uh, that, uh, that would be my hunch.PRESIDENT:All right, we shall go over&#352;come in. In otherwords he'll try the, say the same old thing fromnow on.EHRLICHMAN:I would, I would assume so to justify or forcehim to go to Sirica to try to and get immunity (unintelligible)&#8211;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;showing to the Judge what kind of a witnessthis is. So on, and get them off the hook ofthe Executive Branch by having the Judge grant the immunity. (Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible/REMOVED). I think, the Judgecan attach that statement. Really can.EHRLICHMAN:See, you're, you're putting yourself with the(unintelligible) on that.PRESIDENT:I am just saying that immunity is not granted toany major&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:I think that will be read as, as relating toMitchell and, uh,&#8211;APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.43PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:...people of that ilk as well. PRESIDENT:Oh, sure. HALDEMAN:They may decide not to read it as. PRESIDENT:That's right, that&#8482;s the point. HALDEMAN:That&#8482;s correct.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Dean&#8482;ll&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Well&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) HALEDMAN:But, uh&#8211;PRESIDENT:No, I, I&#352;but I, I have told the(unintelligible), I told the Assistant Attorney General, specifically, that nobody should be granted immunity and that includes Dean. (Unintelligible) Rogers agrees with this and the, uh,&#8211;HALDEMAN:The other point that our attorney makes, whichis significant&#352;hold on&#352;that&#8482;s right, the Judgecan grant immunity, but that in the Executive, only the Attorney General can grant it. That holds somewhere else too.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Dean is the only one who cansink Haldeman or Ehrlichman.(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:How am I going to explain it, after making thisstatement? What do I do--say &#64257;Dean is some little, little clerk?&#64258; He&#8482;s my Counsellor, for Christ sake.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.44PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s right, he&#8482;s involved in the Gray thing.They are not going to throw the, throw the whole thing in there. (Unintelligible) no intention to see Dean again unless it&#8482;s useful--I don&#8482;t think you can control him, and uh, he&#8482;s fanatic. I don&#8482;t think, you, you feel, uh, I mean, itwould be useful, let me know.EHRLICHMAN:I will tell you what is lurking in the back ofmy mind is that, based on the chain of circumstances, Dean may be provoked to make a public statement which is slanderous and hostile.PRESIDENT:Another thing. I would like the libel suits. Ithink both of you, and Bob particularly, you ought to have--get yourself a libel lawyer, Bob, and check the, or have Wilson--I&#8482;d use the most vicious libel lawyer there is. I&#8482;d sue every son-of-a-bitch (unintelligible). There have been stories over this period of time. Thatwill make&#352;--that also helps with the public,public opinion. Sue, sue right down the line. It doesn&#8482;t make any difference now about the taking depositions and the rest, does it? The important thing is the story&#8482;s big and I think you ought to go out and, uh, sue people forlibel.HALDEMAN:Do you mean Senator Weicker? PRESIDENT:He's covered. EHRLICHMAN:Oh, he's not, (unintelligible) Issues andAnswers.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) or using newspaper interviews.EHRLICHMAN:That's right.HALDEMAN:It was not on the Floor, he&#8482;s too fuckingstupid. (Laughter)PRESIDENT:Well, well, well the point is though, did he&#352;thething with Weicker is, is whether he said (unintelligible). Was it libelous?APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.45HALDEMAN:Cer--, I think so. I better ask a lawyer.(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Was he that specific&#8211; HALDEMAN:He was damned specific. PRESIDENT:&#8211;that Haldeman knew? HALDEMAN:Yes. &#64257;That, that Haldeman directed and Haldemanwas in personal command of all personnel.&#64258; Irepeat, &#64257;all personnel at the Re-election Committee.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Good, sue him. EHRLICHMAN:I think we should. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:He said that I was in personal command of Liddy,I mean Hunt&#8211;PRESIDENT:I would sue Weicker. HALDEMAN:&#8211;and McCord&#8211; PRESIDENT:I would sue Weicker. HALDEMAN:I have never met or heard of him. PRESIDENT:I would sue Weicker and I&#8482;d depose him God-damnfast. Ask him about the 65 G&#8482;s. John, thislibel thing. You may as well get at the libel thing and have yourself a little, have yourself a little fun.EHRLICHMAN:Might make expenses. EHRLICHMAN:Operating procedure-wise, we&#8482;ve got to main--,ormy recommending, recommendation would be that weshould maintain the facade of normalAPRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.46operations as long as you&#8482;ve taken thisposition. I don&#8482;t think we want to look like something is radically changed.PRESIDENT:Nope. HALDEMAN:Then I think we should come into the office atthe normal time in the morning&#8211;PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:&#8211;and, uh&#8211; PRESIDENT:Have your staff meetings,&#8211; HALDEMAN:Right. PPESIDENT:&#8211;plus you should at the meeting tomorrow withthe energy conference and you should be at theah, the, the, us, Quadriad meeting. You&#8482;re God-damn right.HALDEMAN:Come and go and go as we go along. PRESIDENT:Until, unless and until something happens.(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Now the only exception here is Dean. HALDEMAN:Dean Should not. But nobody will know whetherhe does his normal job or not. But see that&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well&#8211; HALDEMAN:&#8211;nobody gives a damn. PRESIDENT:The basic&#8211; HALDEMAN:He is not visible, and he&#8482;s been out of here fora month anyway.EHRLICHMAN:Any objection to going to Florida this weekend,if you go?APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.47PRESIDENT:Would you like to go&#8211;or?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Would you like to go? HALDEMAN:I don&#8482;t expect to get much sunshine, but&#8211; PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:It might help.HALDEMAN:I think we should unless, unless our lawyerkeeps us here and he could.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:We normally would and I think we should. PRESIDENT:Oh, I think you should, Bob. Right. Nowunderstand that, if they, if they crack thisopenly&#8211;HALDEMAN:Oh well, than that would be a problem. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I think probably(unintelligible) but, uh&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:One concession that I would ask, and that isthat, that people on leave be considered for use of Camp David occasionally.PRESIDENT:Let me say what I had in mind. (Unintelligiblewith tape noise) I want you to go forward and if this thing comes out, which I can&#8482;t believe, I want you to go forward to beat the rap, at all costs, to beat the God damned rap. They&#8482;ll have one hell of a time proving it. Yours is alittle tougher I think, uh, Bob, and uh, itshouldn&#8482;t be&#352;three damned hundred and. That&#8482;s why I hope, I hope you could raise with the Judge, and, your, your attorney--that, please give, gave you the law on that point.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.48HALEDMAN:Yes sir. On that point, yeah. We haven&#8482;tgotten into (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:What the hell is the law on obstruction ofjustice? Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:He&#8482;s briefing that tonight for us. HALDEMAN:He says it&#8482;s, it&#8482;s damn tough, loose.EHRLICHMAN:He cites Glanzer as the major, leading authorityon it. He uses it like a bludgeon.PRESIDENT:Only it it&#8482;s a (unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:Oh, he hasn&#8482;t given us that yet. HALDEMAN:He didn&#8482;t, he didn&#8482;t give us the opinion. Hejust said, &#64257;I&#8482;ll, I&#8482;ll tell you on, on, on thetop that it&#8482;s very tough. It&#8482;s, it&#8482;s loose,broad and cases go all the way.&#64258;PRESIDENT:I hope he has an opinion sometime on(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Why the hell (unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Remember I was a little suspicious of Chuck. Iwas not&#352;after all, I said, &#64257;Dean it, uh, what&#8482;she talking to these people for? And rememberthe way I put it is, &#64257;He was saying, &#64257;gee, I&#8482;ve talked to these guys and they&#8482;re mind &#338;picking.&#64258; And I said&#8211;HALDEMAN:Well, they&#8482;re not in error. PRESIDENT:And I said, "I think they are taken.&#64258; Remember?I said that.HALDEMAN:Sure did. PRESIDENT:Well, I don&#8482;t&#352;-I think he was being taken(unintelligible).APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.49EHRLICHMAN:Well I think he figured rape was inevitable sohe was going to enjoy it.PRESIDENT:Remember, Bob, remember, I said, &#64257;I think theyare taking Dean.&#64258;HALDEMAN:Sure do. EHRLICHMAN:Well, as I said before, we beat the rap but we&#8482;redamaged goods.PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s right. You can&#8482;t go back in thegovernment, but I will tell you one thing you can do (unintelligible). ( 10 second pause ) You&#8482;re not damaged goods as far as I am concerned. And ah, it&#8482;s one hell of a thing.The point is that--and let&#8482;s wait and see whathappensHALDEMAN:Sure. Of course. EHRLICHMAN:See where we are. PRESIDENT:We ought to expect the worst but I think that,that what I would like both of you to consider, uh, 50% of your time also for editing, etc., andso forth and so on, with the Foundation. TheFoundation is going to be a hell of a big thing, it&#8482;s gotta be. These first four years are terribly important and so forth. And, uh, I mean, uh, after all, you understand, that if&#352; looking down the road, looking down the road, asfar as uh,--you say your Dad was good at lookingdown the road?HALDEMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:If you are indicted and tried and foundinnocent, it washes away.HALDEMAN: Well&#8211;PRESIDENT:Agree?HALDEMAN:I don&#8482;t&#8211; PRESIDENT:&#8211;for government service, I mean.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 5:20 TO 7:14 P.M.50EHRLICHMAN:On, or for the practice of law.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Really. EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:That isn't true, John. EHRLICHMAN:It depends on the circumstances. HALDEMAN:Yeah, it does.(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:There is nothing I can be discouraged about atthis point. But it&#8482;s, ah, I think we&#8482;ve just about had it. I think the odds are against it.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:Well I&#8482;m not (unintelligible) traffic cases.PRESIDENT:The hell with the traffic cases.

I don&#8482;t, uh I don&#8482;t&#352;uh, I&#8482;ll tell you, my feeling on this is that, I may be an optimist, I&#8482;m just not willing to believe thatthe process will result in a indictment and(unintelligible).

And their checks in this thing are notoverwhelming, but they&#8482;re there and he has justgot to find the right buttons to, ah, push to make it come out right. For that reason, while we maintain the fa&#231;ade for participation (unintelligible) realistically (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I understand that, I understand that.

How old is he?EHRLICHMAN: Look like he&#8482;s about in his late 30&#8482;s. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) general. EHRLICHMAN:How about constitutionally (unintelligible)? PRESIDENT:How about moving Len over there and getting holdof the guy there in New York? (Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:That&#8482;s, that&#8482;s the best parlay that&#8482;s occurredto me, (unintelligible).(Unintelligible/REMOVED)PRESIDENT:Quite technically we can do it.EHRLICHMAN:It&#8482;s reported as saying that I never thought thePresident was very comfortable with the phrase&#64257;guaranteed annual income&#64258;.
