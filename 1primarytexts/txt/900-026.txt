So we should just trying to figure out what our line should be today. I said,"That's fine.&#64258; You still think it's to ourinterest not to have Dean get the, be given immunity?EHRLICHMAN:(Sighs) Uh, he has immunity, he's got todeliver.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah. It's a veritable piece of,it's an incentive for him to lie.EHRLICHMAN:But, the, the problem here is that he hasone incentive to deliver against Bob and me. He has another incentive, on the other hand,if he doesn't take immunity to deliveragainst you.PRESIDENT:That's right.APRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.2EHRLICHMAN:Now, Bob and I parsed out pretty carefully,what his, what his, Bob's recollection ofthe meeting that you had with Dean was, theblackmail bits of stuff.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And, it's Bob's recollection that there'snothing in that meeting, even if it were tape recorded and, and published, that could harm you in the sense of you appearing toobstruct justice.PRESIDENT:Well, the way I suppose you could have itwas that, uh, he got that information andthat set my mind agoing, but we talked aboutblackmail and the cost and so forth, and then I just set up on our own doing our (unintelligible) and so forth. Now,--EHRLICHMAN:You had, according to the records, and wewere, we've been back in trying to reconstruct the stuff from records, you had a series of meetings with Dean --PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Eight or nine of them. PRESIDENT:Oh, that many?EHRLICHMAN:Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, all in a row,oh, well that may be five or six, but anyway, quite a few, several of them running over an hour...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:and -- PRESIDENT:Well, some of those are not more than oneminute each.APRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.3EHRLICHMAN:That's correct. That's correct, and Idon't, I don't have any way of knowing whatwas said in there, or what he was giving youthrough that whole process. Moore's at the Grand Jury today.PRESIDENT:That's fine.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know why. Uh, he just called to saythat held been called in. But, uh, uh, a lot will depend, I guess, on what took placein those meetings that neither Bob nor Iwere in, where you talked to Dean and he talked to you, as to whether there's anyvulnerability from the standpoint of...PRESIDENT:Oh, hey Bob, tell him I'm sorry, but I hadsomething come up.UNIDENTIFIED:Right, fifteen minutes?PRESIDENT:It'll be about 3:15, and put in Kissinger at3:45 now.UNIDENTIFIED:Right, sir. PRESIDENT:Fine. I'm sorry.EHRLICHMAN:In other words, if, if he doesn't getimmunity and he seeks to do the Presidency damage, which I don't think he would do, I,I, thinking more about it, I just don'tthink he's made that way, but, assuming he did...PRESIDENT:His lawyers are made that way.EHRLICHMAN:you, you have to ask yourself what tookplace in those private meetings that might have given him any ammunition. 'Cause hewould have...PRESIDENT:I can begin that, if I remember what wassaid.APRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.4EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. It's awful hard to know.PRESIDENT:I don't know, I mean ---EHRLICHMAN:But, that was a period of time, uh,PRESIDENT:You're talking about the Dean report, uh, -- EHRLICHMAN:that was a period of time before you senthim to Camp David to write it.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:And, I think it's reasonable to assume thatthe blasts in the newspapers, the Mc Cordrevelations, the Gray Hearings, and thecharges against Dean, all took place along in that period of time. You were trying tofigure out what to do about Pat Gray...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:You were trying to find out from Dean whatthe circumstances of his contacts with Graymay have been...PRESIDNET:Right. EHRLICHMAN:uh, about the raw files, the raw FBI files. PRESIDENT:(unintelligible), or else we're talkingabout this case, and, uh, ---EHRLICHMAN:Well, -- PRESIDENT:What do you do, uh, why I had, particularlywith regard to the rest, and if, if he'scertain he brought in information of that kind with regard to the obstruction of justiceEHRLICHMAN:Good.APRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.5PRESIDENT:The fact that I did not ask, act on it then,is --EHRLICHMAN:Well, but you did, you began to act on it,you see, and your course of conduct took you over the, uh, uh, trip to San Clemente, andback, and then all that week after you wereback --PRESIDENT:When did I put you in charge? EHRLICHMAN:30th of March.PRESIDENT:And, why? What did I say?EHRLICHMAN:Well, according to the notes, uh, Mc Cordhad made his charges...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:and, uh, Gray had made his charges that Deanhad lied...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:and you said to me, "look, Dean has to stepout of this...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:"...and you'll just have to get in it andtake it over because I've got to havesomebody to talk to and somebody who can advise me."PRESIDENT:Right. Right.EHRLICHMAN:So, that was at noon, we left for Californiaat three, and between noon and three, if you remember, I went upstairs and drafted aletter from you to me...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:that set that out...APRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.6PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:and I handed that to you on the airplane andyou dated and signed itPRESIDENT:Okay. Right. EHRLICHMAN:and I have that in the files.PRESIDENT:Now, what report did-you make to me? Whatwas that report you made that you were supposed to say that you got hold of, uh,EHRLICHMAN:I had a handwrittenPRESIDENT:Yeah, what, yeah, you didn't have any, whatin, what in, what in essence was it? Did it indicate that Mitchell was involved?EHRLICHMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:Magruder? EHRLICHMAN: Yes. PRESIDENT:Based on what, what Magruder --EHRLICHMAN:Based on what O'Brien told me and what, uh,Magruder had, had, Magruder and not yet talked to me, you see.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:But, based on what Paul O'Brien had told me,based on what, uh, Dean had told me ...PRESIDENT:what did it have for obstruction?EHRLICHMAN:Uh, it had that there were a number ofpeople involved, that it was, that they included, uh, uh, Mitchell, uh,PRESIDENT:Mardian.APRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.7EHRLICHMAN: MardianPRESIDENT:La Rue.EHRLICHMAN:La Rue, Magruder and Dean...PRESIDENT:Uh, huh. EHRLICHMAN:although I, I, it was not possible for me tosay whether Dean's culpability was criminalor not.PRESIDENT:And that was all in your report? EHRLICHMAN:That was in there.PRESIDENT:Have you got those notes?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir, I sure do. PRESIDENT:Good.EHRLICHMAN:They're still in long hand.PRESIDENT:That's right. That all right EHRLICHMAN: Okay. PRESIDENT:that's all right.PRESIDENT:Leave them in longhandEHRLICHMAN:All right. PRESIDENT:Leave them in longhand. EHRLICHMAN:All right. There's eight, eight, it's fourpages both sides.PRESIDENT:Than you called, uh, Kleindienst, and toldhim about that?EHRLICHMAN:Well, if you remember, I talked to you, youhad me see Mitchell, you had me see Magruder, and then I called Kleindienst from your office, and said that, what I hadPRESIDENT:You said--APRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.8EHRLICHMAN:...was largely duplicated by what Magruderhad told me.PRESIDENT:Oh. You called him after MagruderPRESIDENT:had talked to him? EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:But, uh, you were planning that before?EHRLICHMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:You never had talked to him, EHRLICHMAN:That's correct.PRESIDENT:you told me you had talked to him...EHRLICHMAN:'At's right. PRESIDENT:By the time you saw me tomorrow. So,basically, we both came to the wire at thesame time?EHRLICHMAN:That's, that's about it. PRESIDENT:That's pretty good.EHRLICHMAN:That's about it.PRESIDENT:No, I think what Dean is referring to, John,must be that, that they stuck with that and then prior to the Watergate and the nationalsecurityEHRLICHMAN:Well, uh, -- PRESIDENT:On that, we just have to be stonewalling, ofcourse.EHRLICHMAN:That's, that's in the laps of the gods asIsee it, and, uh, --PRESIDENT:Dean and Hunt and all were --APRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.9EHRLICHMAN:I tell you the, again, the, uh,authorization for that, I've been goingthrough my old files up there.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:The way that project was finally representedto me was that it was a covert look at somefiles, which could be read to be that they walked in when the nurse wasn't looking and they flipped through the file. Uh, -PRESIDENT:This the Ellsburg case?EHRLICHMAN:Yes. It wasn't until much later that welearned that they had actually conducted aburglary.PRESIDENT:What about the other thing, the wire, the,wiretapping?EHRLICHMAN:The wiretapping, in most cases, uh, wasconducted under the statute byPRESIDENT:The Bureau. EHRLICHMAN:leave of the Attorney General by the Bureau. PRESIDENT:What about the, but we did some privatewiretapping?EHRLICHMAN:Well, except it never came off, you see. Itwas never conducted, they could never do it.We had the idea --PRESIDENT:Dean had told me he thought it was done. EHRLICHMAN:He may, he may have, but, uh, uh, the only,the only private one that I know of that wasnot actually conducted by the Bureau underproper sanction was one that was gonna be attempted, in Georgetown,...APRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.10PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:and they were, they were never able to doit.PRESIDENT:That's pretty good. EHRLICHMAN: Yep.PRESIDENT:Third point, uh, should I get Dean insometime and talk to him about my various --EHRLICHMAN:I tell you, Ziegler's got a pretty goodthing going with him.PRESIDENT:That's difficult.EHRLICHMAN:And, they talk, and Ron seems to keep himcalmed down. Now, there is one problem, uh,Fred Fielding called me this morning...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...and said, "What shall I do with all thesenotification of subpoena and so forth whenthey come in here" Fred, and I said, "Fred,I can't advise you what to do.&#64258; And he said, "well shall I talk to?&#64258; And I said, "Well, I can't tell you, why don't you talkwith the President.&#64258; And, uh, (Laughs) helooked sort of non-plussed but, uh, there is a problem there, they have no leadership inthat office. Dean's hiding out at home and,uh,PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:just a question of getting somebody in thereto take that overPRESIDENT:The problem with Dean's office is not toodifficult. He didn't want to be down there.APRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.11EHRLICHMAN:Apparently, apparently, is it, do you havethat arrangement with him, that he's -PRESIDENT:No, no. I didn't get him on that.EHRLICHMAN:He just left? PRESIDENT:No. I didn't, I never thought it would, uh,I didn't think Dean would want tostayaiayfrom things.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'm just going to make a note thatwe've got to figure out something to doabout continuity in that office.PRESIDENT:Uh, if you don't think it ought to be done,tell me.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, uh, the, the routine stuff maybe,'member we said yesterday what we would do is have him check everything with Moore, but if Moore's going to be out of pocket, uh,then that isn't going to work.PRESIDENT:God damn it, it'd been marvelous. EHRLICHMAN:It could, and, and, in terms that, uh, -- PRESIDENT:of knowledge.EHRLICHMAN:In checking back in my records, it'sfascinating. I have had no more than two meetings a month with Dean over a period ofa year, uh, in, alone. I have had severalmeetings involving Dean and Moore. I have had several meetings involving Dean and Bob. Uh, he, he, couple of months, maybe. And,uh, -PRESIDENT:I was thinking that, uh, after this meetingtoday, I might go up to Camp David and tryto see if I can break my sleeping pattern,but,...APRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.12EHRLICHMAN:Good, --PRESIDENT:Do you think it'd be all right if you go up?EHRLICHMAN:If you'd like me to, sure.PRESIDENT:And Bob might go up EHRLICHMAN:Be happy to.PRESIDENT:You have a little rest on your hands.EHRLICHMAN: Okay. PRESIDENT:It's necessary as hell. EHRLICHMAN: Fine.PRESIDENT:You don't think that would present any-aw,the hell with it, we're gonna go ahead and act as if we'reEHRLICHMAN:doing business sure.PRESIDENT:They'd figure we're talking, maybe get, getHenry to go-no he's a pain in the ass (unintelligible). Uh, well, the Dean trick,let's put it in basic terms of charges andso forth, was shocking, God damned Dean, but, uh, it was my mistake, I was just trying to find out what to do and he seemedto be working toward the same end. But, letme ask you this, John, the only problem that I see is whether or not the conversationthat occurred in Dean's reporting to me,whether or not he interpreted that, and you, and and, we, sort of a concerted plan here at the White House to see how we couldabsolve the White House and others,(unintelligible) this is part of the cover-up.EHRLICHMAN:Well, you know, I&#8482;ve been giving that a lotof thought, trying to parse it out, I, I had a talk with Clark Mc Gregor today, because right after the convention...APRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.13PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:uh, I wanted to see us make a clean breastofPRESIDENT:I know EHRLICHMAN:to 1701 situation...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:and I called Clark to get hisrecollection...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:of that whole thing. He said Dean providedhim with a scenario at that time, uh, typed out.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:And he said it was such a phony... PRESIDENT:Bit. EHRLICHMAN:...thing, that that's what turned him off.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And I&#8482;m finding out all the way throughhere, John was a guy that, that always put blocks. That he...PRESIDENT:He's a clever fellow like that son of abitch (unintelligible) Mitchell.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) that's that's, you see thething I'm telling you, heuas downfieldblocking for Mitchell the whole time.PRESIDENT:Then our, then we can just brush him(unintelligible) .EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, and he's got a conflict of interests,because he's not looking out for you,PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.14EHRLICHMAN:...he's looking out for Mitchell, andsomehow or all an other, I imagine, in hismind, he ver, sincerely thought there was acoincidence of interest.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:But, it's a fatal flaw. And I can remembervery vividly Bob coming in seven or eight months ago and saying, "Do you know what we're doing?&#64258; He said, "We're savingMitchell's ass."PRESIDENT:Bob Haldeman, you mean? EHRLICHMAN: Yeah.PRESIDENT:Before the election?EHRLICHMAN:To me. PRESIDENT:Before the election? EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. Well, I don't know,PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Before or around that time, it was six,eight months ago. He said, everthing we're doing around here, all the heat we'retaking, all the gas we're taking, he said,"I think Mitchell's behind this thing, and I think that if we went to disclose this wholething, that's who would fall." Well, quitehonestly, I suspected the same thing...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...without having any evidence of it andthat's the reason I wanted to open it all upafter he was gone.PRESIDENT:Now Dean, now Dean tried to keep you(unintelligible)?APRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.15EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Yeah. It's a tough one well, uh, asI get into these -PRESIDENT:Well on the immunity thing, let me say, I&#8482;m,uh, I'm leaving it, frankly, that I put that chart across the table,EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...now they've got to make up their minds.I think I've, that is the right thing to do in any event.EHRLICHMAN:It, it certainly read right.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:You know, from the standpoint --PRESIDENT:I think more than that part of reading, Itold the Assistant Attorney General I thought it, it was wrong to, uh, I thought it was, so they'd probably come in and askDean to keep his (unintelligible) shut. Idon't think his --EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Yeah. PRESIDENT:He obviously can't believe that from talkingto Ziegler (unintelligible) that during thistime the U.S. Attorney was forecasting this, that and the other, and so forth. I thinkat that time, they were sucking him in.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Yeah. PRESIDENT:Sucking him in. EHRLICHMAN:Or he was sucking us in, I don't know which.PRESIDENT:Well, the idea being, well, I can get thesebig fish for you.APRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.16EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. They're going to bring the things hewas saying to us.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Right.EHRLICHMAN:All the time we're lulling and, uh, saying,you know, that they're not after all of us--PRESIDENT:Well, when I talked to him, John, I saidthis, now I think that, John let me tell you this, I said to Dean, I said" Any conversation you have with me is privileged.You understand?&#64258; He said, "Yes, Iunderstand.&#64258; I said, "Any conversation in the national security area, even if you'rethere, is privileged. You understand that?&#64258;He said, "fine." "Everything else is not privileged," so I went through all the whole thing. But that, that doesn't necessarilyrestrict the President, does it?EHRLICHMAN:Well, our fellows, our lawyers are trying tofigure out how that privilege is asserted. You might, it might be an interesting thingto put Petersen to work on that. Ask him togive you a brief on how your Executive Privilege is asserted in a criminal case ofthis kind to keep a witness from making thenational security disclosures.PRESIDENT:(Sighs) EHRLICHMAN:Let him run a brief out for you.PRESIDENT:What other (unintelligible). Uh, the, uh,oh, the, the, he didn't tell me about Moore coming down and discussing things with him,so, and uh, -oh, he said the ErvinCommittee, they're having problems with Senator Ervin's Committee, but the Counsel has defeated, uh, the, if you ask me, kindof, that silly thing Kleindienst worked outto subpoena the records onAPRIL 18, 1973, FROM 3:05 TO 3:23 P.M.17Mc Cord and, uh, LaRue, I don't know, therewere a couple others he mentioned, but theyEHRLICHMAN:The FBI reports?PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN: Huh.PRESIDENT:And, of course, this just drives Petersen upa wall. The Prosecutors (unintelligible) threatened to go on.EHRLICHMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:They'll be all right. (Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Hum, hum, hum. Well, they can fight with acadaver.PRESIDENT:I think they're, I just, I virtually thoughtthe, the, uh, Committee, and the Prosecution, I don't think there so God damn sure there of their ground on you and Bob.I just don't think it's true. I don't knowwhether or not you'll analyze it after you think about it a couple of days, but, --EHRLICHMAN:I fell better about it after getting intothe facts under the, --PRESIDENT:Well, apart from the facts, the way it isJohn, why don't you circle around and getthat Hunt and (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Fine. PRESIDENT:What? EHRLICHMAN:Burns has got a couple of personality(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I, I (unintelligible) straighten that out. EHRLICHMAN:Good.
