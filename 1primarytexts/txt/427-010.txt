Uh,PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:I was working on a draft when you called. PRESIDENT:Good. I've got to see Rogers in two orthree minutes, so, uh [unintelligible].Thought we'd have it ready for [unintelligible] for Christ's sakes when I haven&#8482;t heard.___________________*The quotation marks used in this transcriptare for convenience and do not indicateverbatim quotation by the speaker.DEAN:Uh, I, I think I was -calling Dick Moore inon it, 'cause Dick has been workingPRESIDENT:Good. DEAN:on some of these othersPRESIDENT:Good.DEAN:and, uh PRESIDENT:What would be best, rather than give it in afew pieces though, why don't you, uhDEAN:Put one together. PRESIDENT:All right. DEAN:It&#8482;s got a strong thrust. It puts you wayout front.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible]. You get, finally get thelead statement out of it.DEAN:Well, this is, this is the, there's a toughquestion in here that I'd really like to drive it home,PRESIDENT:Yeah sure.DEAN:is the degree of biting the bullet right atthis hour. Now there's one paragraphPRESIDENT:There are the questions of timing. DEAN:Questions of timing, but there's just alsothe question of -I have one paragraph inhere where it says what you&#8482;re doing as a result of what's come to your attention-2-and some of it goes to the Petersen thingand, and the fact--PRESIDENT:Uh huh. Uh huh. DEAN:One of the points is that you've advised allmembers of the White House Staff who'll becalled before the Grand Jury that, effective immediately, they'll be on administrativeleave until such time as the Grand Jurycompletes its work. Now here's the, uh,PRESIDENT:Um huh. DEAN:tough paragraph, if you go this far: "Inthis connection, I have not even spared inthis decision my closest staff advisors and included in this action are H. R. Haldeman,Assistant to the President, John Ehrlichman,Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs, and John Dean, Counsel to the President.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Um huh.DEAN:Now, you can do that or you can leave thatout and let them guess who is on administrative leave.PRESIDENT:Anybody called before the Crand Jury.DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible]-3-DEAN:[Unintelligible] that no man--PRESIDENT:bite the, the bullet on, uh, Dean, Haldeman,and Ehrlichman. So then -now the other thing -the Garment line. Have you talked toLen?DEAN:No, I haven't. PRESIDENT:Well, I'd like you to talk with him.DEAN:All right.PRESIDENT:His line, he says thatparticularlyEhrlichman.DEAN:I have a, I have aPRESIDENT:Say he should just resign, right now. Butthe trouble with that is that I just don't think Petersen -Here's &#338;Petersen says,incidentally, on your letter, he thinks it'sprobably better, just better to get the letter, to get a letter in hand, to get the, to get where you can sit down, uh, and Isaid, "Well, uh, what, what do you thinkabout it?" I, I -He said, "There's still negotiating with your attorneys.&#64258;DEAN:Um huh.-4-PRESIDENT:And I said, well, I don't want to doanything to [unintelligible] negotiation or jeopardize the rights [unintelligible] defendant. He feels that the, that[unintelligible] wasn't clear, but he is notrecommending it.DEAN:Um huh.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]. He says, stand clear.However, of tie probable prosecution, that it Would not be harmful to an individual, you know, if, if we had the resignations inhand, so at least, you know [unintelligible]I put them on leave, for [unintelligible].DEAN:Um huh.PRESIDENT:Well there you have --Well you have--Letme s--, let meDEAN:Well, PRESIDENT:see what you had in mind.DEAN:I have,PRESIDENT:Let's just talk about it. DEAN:I have a letter, uh PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] so bad [unintelligible] aletter.DEAN:Uh, to -what I thought, I thought was fair.-5-DEAN:Fair to everybody.PRESIDENT:This is for getting [unintelligible]? DEAN:Amy of the critics, yeah, I, I, I wrote, uh,uh, ""Dear Mr. President: You informed methat Bob Haldeman and John Ehrlichman haveverbally tendered their request to give them immediate and indefinite leave of absencefrom the staff. So I declare I wish also toconfirm my similar request that I be given such a leave of absence from the staff.&#64258; This doesn't raise anything.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] nothing.DEAN:Well, uh, no I, I think that, uh-- PRESIDENT:I'm just [unintelligible]DEAN:I think there is the problem--PRESIDENT:You don't want to go if they stay. DEAN:There is a problem for you of the scapegoatthe--, theory.PRESIDENT:Making use of it?DEAN:That's right. That's right. PRESIDENT:Like Magruder's been a scapegoat forMitchell.-6-DEAN:That's right. Uh, you know, everybody whois appearing before the Grand Jury. Who This does not impute guilt to anybody. UhPRESIDENT:Put it this way, I think rather thanLeonard's [unintelligible]DEAN:[Clears throat] PRESIDENT:And the truth of the matter, uh[unintelligible] trouble before[unintelligible)]. Yes, I guess that, I can say that, that, that I, that you are -"You"' is not a polite word. You've[unintelligible] responsibility. We orallyhave, we orally have said thatDEAN:That&#8482;s right.PRESIDENT:in this case, and that, uh --DEAN:The only man you're dealing with isPetersen. The only role I have is to help fill in any information I canPRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:to deal with the, the public relations ofthe problem, so that, you know, you know what-7-PRESIDENT:But you could say, you; could say,definitely, John you could say, "The President talked to me about it. He said [unintelligible) till it cleared up.''DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:And, uh [unintelligible] I don't know thatthe [unintelligible] will end.And[unintelligible] Haldeman.DEAN:[Unintelligible] unnecessary. PRESIDENT:And that goes out ahead of, frankly theMagruder-Mitchell head-chop business.DEAN:That's right; what's the tiling on that? Doyou know?PRESIDENT:Yeah, we haven't made a deal with--wehaven't made--any a deal with Magruder, uh,or Magruder's lawyers yet. Magruder is bearing in tight on the Ervin Committee and on Sirica. [Unintelligible] Haig. I mean,I, and I've asked youDEAN:Right. PRESIDENT:from time to time your judgments, and I mayask Ehrlichman about this or that. But Imeant -I, I don't want him to, I don't wanthim to talk to anybody else, except, you know,-8-except when preparing this sort of thing.DEAN:Right. PRESIDENT:But I mean, uh, other, sort of, people that DEAN:"I'm not doing any investigative work&#352;&#64257;PRESIDENT:Well, that's what I -peopleDEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:should not come in to tell you that[unintelligible] go before the Grand Jury,for Christ's sakes, or the Attorney General.DEAN:And I've turned that off, essentially threeweeks ago. [Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Good. [Unintelligible] three weeks, anyway,have you?DEAN:No sir.PRESIDENT:Have them realize: March twenty-first.We've got to go check back and see [unintelligible]DEAN:[Unintelligible/REMOVED] assess the overallproblem for the White House.[Unintelligible] technical problems.-9-PRESIDENT:Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. He thinks that, u[unintelligible]. What kind of a,problem [unintelligible] and Haldeman have.DEAN:I think the thought of having -being thefirst who testifies is very painful for me.PRESIDENT:Just tell the truth. DEAN:That's right. That's what I'm going to do.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]DEAN:Amen. PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible) when I say I'm thinking.They don't think it's funny.[Unintelligible/REMOVED]. What I reallyneed then, is to say -One thing thatPetersen did raise with me that[unintelligible] bit [unintelligible] withregard to, uh, uh, Ehr--, Haldeman push? What I said, now, was &#64257;Hal--, Did Haldeman have prior knowledge? Did he know, didEhrlichman know, did Dean know?&#64258; And yousaid, &#64257;No.&#64258; Beforehand.DEAN:That&#8482;s right. PRESIDENT:Right. And he suggests that I say nothing.He told me this, he says: "If Dean istestifying" -"No, he's-10-not testifying to his conversations," hesaid that "He came over to Haldeman after that brief meeting and told him about the plan, which is the whole [unintelligible]&#64258;.(Unintelligible) says, "You're right.&#64258; So,his point being that actually Haldeman, then, did know.DEAN:No, I, I, I disagree with thatinterpretation. But,PRESIDENT:You see, DEAN:I didn't--PRESIDENT:my -tell you what, I didn't know, but I, I--DEAN:My ingression was-- PRESIDENT:If that was the case you see, John, then,uh, I, uh, I would have to s--, then I wouldhave to, uh -he has told me something that's different from what you've told me.DEAN:No. I, I've always reported it exactly thatway, be cause Bob has told me he didn'tknow. Now, I know I didn't know, because I feel that--PRESIDENT:What about this, this conversation?[Unintelligible]. He said, "I have donesomething about it.&#64258;DEAN:I,-11-PRESIDENT:Bob's [unintelligible] Bdb's responsibilityto talk to him.DEAN:I think what happened, I think whathappened, Mr. President, is that everyoneassumed that John Mitchell would neverapprove anything like this. I just assumed it. I told him I was not going to have anyfurther dealings with Liddy or anybody overthere on this and I didn't.PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah, yeah. DEAN:And, I didn't have the foggiest notion whatthey were doing.PRESIDENT:That's what you had told me, you know. Wewent, uh, through it over and over.DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:I, I, I didn't know. I didn't know, ofcourse.DEAN:But I don't think -Bob tells me he did nothave knowledge. Now, the question is -theother thing is I cannot even describe, I couldn't describe twenty minutes after the meeting, uh, what Liddy was presenting. Itwas the most spectacular sales pitch you'veever seen, in codes and charts, and right out of James Bond.-12-PRESIDENT:Operation Gemstone.DEAN:Well, that's what I'm told, now later, afterthe fact, they called it -I don't remember. I, I told Bob, I said, "They're talkingabout bugging; they're talking aboutkidnapping, and they're talking about, uh, mugging squads -take people down from SanDiego south of the border."PRESIDENT:Who did you told to, uh -You told Bob this? DEAN:Yes, I did. PRESIDENT:And he said?DEAN:He said, &#64257;Absolutely no&#64258;.PRESIDENT:No. DEAN:No.PRESIDENT:So you will so testify, then.DEAN:That's right. Absolutely. PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] DEAN:That's correct. But I don't know, and Iassume that, uh -Bob didn't -never told meto the contrary that nothing happened from the time of that meeting where he-13-told me to, "Don't do anything about it andjust stay away from it, don't talk to them.&#64258; And Liddy agreed not to. I said to Liddy, "The last thing is that I'm never going totalk to you about this again, Gordon.&#64258; WhatI thought was, that inaction would result in their, in their [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Inaction from you.DEAN:Inaction from me. Without my hands at thatstagePRESIDENT:Yeah, but then you, then when it happened --DEAN:I don't knowPRESIDENT:You don't even know the Mitchell thing, doyou?DEAN:Well, I, I don't have direct know--PRESIDENT:Magruder says, DEAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:he says that, uh [unintelligible] I, I feelthat your statement is consistent with whatyou told me earlier.DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:I wish you would tell, uh [unintelligible].I don't reallyDEAN:[Unintelligible] come down strong on ---14-PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible) White House and Haldeman[unintelligible]. You admit that he said, he said, "Absolutely not," and he agreed.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:That's what, uh (unintelligible]DEAN:And Bob and I have gone over that after thefact, and he recalls my coming into thatofficePRESIDENT:Yeah. Uh huh. DEAN:and telling him PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:that, about this crazy scheme that's beingcooked up.PRESIDENT:You want to go over and get, uh, gettogether, uh--DEAN:I'll work on this statement PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] DEAN:and then we'll have something.PRESIDENT:Uh huh.DEAN:Too much to, to put people on administrative-15-leave that are going to go before the GrandJury.PRESIDENT:Bill Rogers. They're gonna have him overthere [unintelligible]DEAN:And so I think thatPRESIDENT:Everybody's in the middle of this, John. DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:None of us can really, none of us, I don'tthink, uh [unintelligible]DEAN:All I'm trying to think is how to get youout in front.PRESIDENT:That's right. The whole point. I don'tknow how. It's just, uh, hard to think of it. I tried to get to talk, uh, with[unintelligible] negotiate for Magruder.DEAN:Can't [unintelligible] -Yes, I said, "Noabuse."PRESIDENT:Right.DEAN:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] Magruder [unintelligiblej DEAN:They're taking him into court to do this. PRESIDENT:Huh?DEAN:They're going to take Magru&#352;--16-PRESIDENT:I know.DEAN:--der into court to do this. [Unintelligible]RESIDENT:Lou Lavelle [Phonetic] went.DEAN:I know.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] DEAN:I don't think we're going to have many leaksout of the Grand Jury or, or the[unintelligible] court. Local court et cetera.PRESIDENT:Uh, buy uh, what do you think John[unintelligible] operating too short -by aday.DEAN:What about Hunt, too.PRESIDENT:You, Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Magruderknows. I'd like to follow that. [Unintelligible]DEAN:What -How can he respond to that? I don'tunderstand that.PRESIDENT:Uh huh. DEAN:[Unintelligible] his testimony before theGrand Jury.PRESIDENT:This testimony makes a statement[unintelligible]-17-DEAN:I can't in public statement without namingany individuals. [Unintelligible] the rights of that individual. That's why I don&#8482;t think that I, I can't foresee whathe's going to say. [Unintelligible] namingany, any individual.PRESIDENT:You see, I think my own (unintelligible] Irequested that the U.S. Attorney call beforethe Grand Jury.DEAN:[Unintelligible] all, all your staff. PRESIDENT:I am to cooperate.DEAN:Um huh.PRESIDENT:How about trying that for a little[unintelligible] John? [Unintelligible] ifthe White House staff gets called before theGrand Jury and questioned.DEAN:The prosecution will [unintelligible] neededsomebody to wash or, or the like. They mayor may not want to hear, and by the way, Iwould, I would bounce that one off Henry, uh--PRESIDENT:Yeah, Ehrlichman and Haldeman and Magruder.DEAN:It is, it has been? Or--PKESIDENT:We can always find reasons.-18-DEAN:And Hunt's.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] oh, my God, we've got toleave (unintelligible] Ehrlichman and Haldeman predict, thank God [unintelligible]world. They were on top; they're shot down.DEAN:That's right. [Unintelligible]. The otherthing that always worried um is not gettingshot down, but not giving out enough, andstarting a, a chain going that we didn't want, because we didn't give enough. Uh, would, uh -[coughs][Unintelligible]unfortunately, the source of the problem,and it's just, it's mind boggling but you think about it, uh--PRESIDENT:And--DEAN:He didn't care PRESIDENT:All across [unintelligible] DEAN:That's right Lord knows. Lord knows[unintelligible]PRESIDENT:And after he didn't turn it off-- DEAN:And then we bailed him out, and that's whywe have a problem.-19-PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] and then you said the wholeWhite House at least, uh, up to you, and Ehrlichman, Haldeman after regretfully dealing with the fact. We've just got tokeep the thing from going upstairs, toMitchell, I mean, your conversation with MagruderDEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:The fact that, uh, you're supposed tosupport him&#352;-everybody--DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:and therefore Mitchell and [unintelligible]DEAN:Oh, Mitchell, Mitchell was making heavycomments about, you know, if Hunt and Liddyblow, the White House will have a biggerproblem than he will, sort of things.PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:Whatever they had done over here would bequite embarrassing during the election,also.PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:And I suppose there's some truth in that.No hard facts. Just [unintelligible)Ellsberg's office, and things like that.-20-PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] that wouldn't have beenvery good.DEAN:You know, uh, you know, poor Bud Krogh, uh,is just miserable, knowing what he knows.PRESIDENT:Meaning Ellsberg?DEAN:Yeah, he's -- PRESIDENT:Yeah, well [unintelligible]DEAN:Hopefully not. There's no reason it shouldbe. The only evidence that they have which they must That's one of the reasons I have argued against a special prosecutor. Thespecial prosecutor is going to run acrossevidence that's screwy. [Unintelligible) that picture, that picture in front of thedoctor's office. [Unintelligible] can't getinto that.PRESIDENT:This is not their ca-that they're-- DEAN:That's not their case. It just got forcedon them.PRESIDENT:That's right. DEAN:When I was first, you know, first talking,uh, with regard to [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]DEAN:they wanted to just, just, just the originaltime run these guys through the Grand Jury,with immunity, and see what came out.-21-PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]DEAN:Uh, let us fight our battle with the Senate. PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] DEAN:Absolutely.PRESIDENT:We've been through this particular[unintelligible]DEAN:They pulled it out inch by inch, uh, andit'll just, uh, it'll bring you down with itin this [unintelligible] committee.PRESIDENT:Well, it hurts, as you say. DEAN:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:It won't pull us down. [Unintelligible], Wecan wait and handle it in the [unintelligible] court.DEAN:We never--PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] virtually nine months.[Unintelligible]DEAN:Dean couldn't get there with the facts.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] they'll ask.DEAN:I didn't have the power to compel Mitchellor Magruder-22-to tell me what had happened. I justsurmised that had happened.PRESIDENT:The (unintelligible] DEAN:I've been, uh, to be very honest, I'vetalked about it around here before I got into see you for many, many months. Uh, I said, you know, I said the containmenttheory is not working anymore so you mightas well forget it.PRESIDENT:Right. That's what you came in to see me?Fine.DEAN:Fine. It works. Finally, I started comingin to see you and that's when we started getting action.PRESIDENT:I have no right [unintelligible]DEAN:Then I was told by all of those afterjoining this, that'd be talking surrender. I'm not talking surrender. I'm talkingrealistically. [Unintelligible]investigation going. They've got subpoena power, immunity power, and they're going to break somebody up there, just as pure -And,uh, I've always said that it's a dominosituation--One, one goes -and that's exactly what's happened here, Mr. President.PRESIDENT:The poor guys.-23-DEAN:The poor men and the [unintelligible] allthe way around.PRESIDENT:Secretaries, [unintelligible) DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT& DEAN:[Unintelligible] DEAN:How do you want to handle it: Ehrlichman,Haldeman and Dean?PRESIDENT:That's a good question. [Unintelligible]the biggest part of that question is when, under the circumstances it's, uh--DEAN:Here's the argument I, I've been meaning totell you: First of all, there is, there's, there is potential There are prima faciesituations right now that are very difficultin, uh, to prove in context that -been made aware of. Uh, does that thereby make it necessary for you to make a judgment thatthose people should leave the staff untiltheir, their name is cleared?PRESIDENT:It makes it necessary for me to relieve themof any duty if this peaks.DEAN:That's right.-24-PRESIDENT:Which I have done. It makes it necessaryfor me to [unintelligible] Haldeman turn it down, which I end up.DEAN:But thatI don't know --PRESIDENT:I'm happy to discuss it with him, butwhether, you just say let's go all out and tromp their ass. I do not--DEAN:That's the tougher question, because one,that's pitting you in the position of being the, the judge and trier of the facts.PRESIDENT:Before--DEAN:Before all the facts. are in, necessarily.PRESIDENT:That's really my problem on that. I mean, Iso this fellow says that, and this fellowsays thatthat's I the thing that concernsme.DEAN:Will, maybe that's the way this ought to behandled, publicly. Say, "I have certaininformation about -you know, allegationshave been made about persons, some publicly -some have not become public yet--but I am not in a position where I can make any"PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah.DEAN:"judgements, because all the facts aren't inyet."-25-PRESIDENT:But you really think, John, don't you, that,uh, you [unintelligible] in the meantime--DEAN:Okay. PRESIDENT:Your statement, this statement is terriblyimportant. And, then frankly, somethingvery shortly beforehand [unintelligible]. Right?DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:I'll talk to you on Thursday.[Unintelligible] Thank you.DEAN:Yes sir.PRESIDENT:Would you say that you [unintelligible]move, uh [unintelligible] in this area?DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:And, uh [unintelligible].-26-
