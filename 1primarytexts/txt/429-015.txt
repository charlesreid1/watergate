You know, itcould be a lot -- ask me what I said to you,in your presence.PRESIDENT:I don't think that'll be asked. MOORE:(Unintelligible) Special Counsel. I don'tthink it will. But they say, "Have you evertalked to the President about it?" I think they'll say that that matter is one ofExecutive Privilege.PRESIDENT:Yes. Well, now I... MOORE:(Unintelligible)... PRESIDENT:What I would say, I'd say, "Of course Ihave."MOORE:Yes. PRESIDENT:"Of course, I have. And there's, uh, thePresident's--...APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.4MOORE:...position.PRESIDENT:"The President's view is my personal pointof view."MOORE:Good. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)MOORE:Well, that's good. I'd much prefer thatbut, uh,...PRESIDENT:I'd say, "Yes, of course I have. ThePresident's uh, expressed his views and hisviews are accurate" or whatever you want tosay.MOORE:It was very well expressed. But, uh,...PRESIDENT:But go ahead, uh, what, what did Chapmantell you to do?MOORE:He said, "Look, you've got to tell thetruth." He said, "About the last thing thePresident needs is any more non-truthtelling."PRESIDENT:That's right. MOORE:He said, "You don't to have phrase it theway they want you to phrase it." Put itthat way.PRESIDENT:Exactly right. Which of course they'regonna try to, they're gonna try to, get youto phrase it in the a way that will sink somebody else.MOORE:I know.PRESIDENT:Can't do.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.5MOORE:I know. And, uh, uh, (tape noise) has toldyou --I, I guess, but we don't know what itis but -- of course, I had met himprivately.PRESIDENT:There's the problem.MOORE:Yeah. Uh -- uh -- when I -- what he wouldsigh and say this thing was getting so awful and he'd hint around and duck.PRESIDENT:When was this?MOORE:Oh, over the last -- I got active in this --course I was in on the Segretti thing--PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:We discussed that back in October and thenagain in December.PRESIDENT:Right. MOORE:And I met Chapin-about it. In an advisoryrole. And then, uh, in Watergate I, was on,occasionally on something (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible with tape noise) about thisin January?MOORE:Oh, no, during -sometime in -betweenDecember and say February.PRESIDENT:Oh, after the election.MOORE:Oh, yes, yeah.PRESIDENT:Now, okay. MOORE:Before the election, my roleconsisted-wasn't a very good task, but theystarted meeting -- Cliff Miller and I weresort of PR advisors to Mitchell, Stans, and--APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.6PRESIDENT:Well, didn't -- in those before theelection, uh, Ziegler tells me that allthose who talked to Dean, Dean's flatlysaid, nobody in the White House was involved."MOORE:Dean--PRESIDENT:Cause I asked him that question. You knowthat's the first thing I asked him...MOORE:Sure.PRESIDENT:...throughout. I said, "now, John I've gotto know this one thing, was anybody in the White House involved"? He said, "No." Andwe, then, of course, came to the postperiod.MOORE:He had always denied... PRESIDENT:And that he...MOORE:...(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...denied, denied that he was involved. MOORE:That's right. PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:Whathe acknowledged to me, and was thegeneral type of thing, he said, "Oh, Liddy came in with the damnedest plan" and he said"it involved all kinds of crazy things."PRESIDENT:Right. That was plan number one. MOORE:"And I said get those charts the hell out ofhere, that sort of thing, can't contemplatesomething like that. That shouldn't be...PRESIDENT:..."talked about (unintelligible). MOORE:..."in the presence of Attorney General."APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.7PRESIDENT:Right. Right.MOORE:Dean has told you a good...PRESIDENT:...told me though, he told me about histhree conversations and so forth.MOORE:Yeah. Well...PRESIDENT:He's been very forthcoming about that.MOORE:Yeah. Well, he told me that and I said,"Well, John, I, I would have a, a hard, hard time believing that John Mitchell knew thisthing was going on."PRESIDENT:--I asked Dean early, you know, when Ifirst--MOORE:Yeah.PRESIDENT:when I first got into was when, uh,basically just before the whole goddamn thing that, that crazy McCord got into it.MOORE:Right.PRESIDENT:And I'm glad, I'm glad it's out. I want itdone. Finished. Don't you agree?MOORE:Absolutely finished.PRESIDENT:Get the son-of-a-bitch finished. I thoughtit should have been long ago,...MOORE:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...what the, what the --I'm afraid that ourgreat, dear friend, John Mitchell is the culprit. Cause John Mitchell knew about it. John Mitchell just couldn't bear goingbefore--frankly saying right after the capersaying, "well, whoa, whoa this was a terrible thing. I didn't approve of thisspecific and I condem it." And that's whathe should have said. But he didn't do it.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.8MOORE:Yeah.PRESIDENT:As a result, ever since then they've had theresponsibility of taking care of thedefendants' counsel and some of their expenses and so forth and so on. Andgetting other people involved and that'sjust been wrong.MOORE:You said it the first time, a cover-up--zealots do things in the campaign whichis one thing, is bad enough...PRESIDENT:Right MOOORE:...but covering 'em up is what kills ya,.PRESIDENT:That's right, that's right.MOORE:And that's what-- PRESIDENT:As far as my knowledge is concerned, that'sthe real tragedy. I didn't really, I neversaw Dean until after the election. Well,except to sign my wills, as I recall. And I never, even occurred to me to ask him because apparently he had told -- I, I,before my press conference in California,for Ziegler, Ziegler's been asking for guidance and I said, "what is thesituation?" He said, "Well, I talked toDean." I said, "Does he say nobody was involved?" He said, "all right, then you can say that." It's the only thing we coulddo, wasn't it? What else could we --MOORE:Absolutely, and, then t-- but has he... PRESIDENT:But I think, I really think, I really think,Dean, naturally he was covering Mitchell(unintelligible with tape noise) What do you think?MOORE:Well, I don't know, well, I was not thatclose to his side of it, you know, at thattime. (Unintelligible) that was August 29th.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.9PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:It made you sick, so, I was involved in theconvention, getting ready for it,...PRESIDENT:Right. MOORE:...and so forth. And this thing stilllooked like nothing but a, almost as Ronsaid, a third rate burglary. (Unintelligible). And, uh, I, I don't recall being surprised at his finding or, orquestioning him. I frankly thought, at thattime, that this was Liddy (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:Just took off.MOORE:...money. PRESIDENT:Well, I thought that too. MOORE:That it wasn't (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:That was my belief throughout,(unintelligible). I would have maybe called Mitchell and said, "John for Christ's sakes...MOORE:Yeah. Yeah.PRESIDENT:"...let's do it." I, I, of course Icouldn't believe anybody as smart asMitchell would ever have allowed(unintelligible) So stupid.MOORE:So unlike him. I saw him for a year overthere, you know. You know you can't do thatkind of thing you do...PRESIDENT:That's right. (tape noise) come on now toDean and when you began to get -- what's,what's there to know.MOORE:Well,-- PRESIDENT:I like those cigars.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.10MOORE:To the best of my recollection, I really gotinvolved when, and it makes sense, uh, rightafter the Senate passed the resolutionsetting up the Committee.PRESIDENT:Right.MOORE:Which was mid-February. (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:As a matter of fact, Dick, it's aninteresting coincidence, the first time I ever saw Dean was when you and Dean came intogether. Remember you and Dean came intogether that day.MOORE:Yes. (Unintelligible) Executive privilegediscussion in the press conference(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:That's right. MOORE:Now, I did state that well, after one ofthose meetings, that, "John, things aremoving into a point where the President may be being disserved, maybe doesn't know what the, what the problems are." John washinting, at that time, about the darnproblems.PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:And I think he told me that he was gonna(unintelligible) it or--PRESIDENT:Come in and see me alone. MOORE:That's right, he did. Yes.PRESIDENT:He did. By his credit, he came in. He saidnow -- he didn't lay it, yes, he laid it out pretty much. He laid out his concern thatMitchell did know about the four meetingswhere Mitchell testified or put out a line--or not testified. Where Magruder denied there was any. He said that waswrong, and he went on to -- he didn'tindicate the subornation of perjury point which apparently, he's stuck into very deepnow where he, he pointed to Magruder in histestimony.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.11MOORE:Yeah.PRESIDENT:See that's about it.MOORE:Occasionally, he would say to me, you know,"I've got to struggle with this thing without doing that. I, I haven't meant todo anything," he said, "but Magruder's gonnatry to finger me or somebody else."PRESIDENT:Yeah. How's he gonna handle it? MOORE:He said, "What I told him was you've gottatell the truth." He said, "I told him whatkinds of questions he was going to be asked. I talked to him, but I never and, and I'dsay 'It's up to you' (unintelligible). "PRESIDENT:He told me the same thing. MOORE:Yeah. And I believe him. PRESIDENT:Cause I, uh, -huh?MOORE:I believe John.PRESIDENT:You don't believe do you believe him now? MOORE:Uh, No. I, w-well, I think the bigger liaris Magruder. (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well Magruder is.MOORE:Yeah. Well Magruder is, is, is -thequestion of credibility.PRESIDENT:Magruder's lying more than Dean?MOORE:I think so. I have a personal complaint... PRESIDENT:Is Magruder trying to do Dean in? MOORE:Yeah. They hate each other, Magruder, Deantold me...APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.12PRESIDENT:I just -- what?MOORE:Dean told me, at some point, you know, hesaid, "the one I worry about in all this isMagruder." He said, he's not gonna go down alone. He's saying that if he goes down,he's gonna take the whole cover-up,particularly me. This is so. (Tape noise) "I coached him on his testimonies. I didn't, I didn't. I gave him his options.I told him what the options were."PRESIDENT:Yeah. MOORE:And, uh, he said...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) tell you about Magruder?MOORE:He said, "what's" -I mean he was talkingabout Bob Finch and said, "by the way, Jeb Magruder came up here and, what's wrong withhim because he was telling all kinds ofcrazy tales (tape noise) conducting a meeting on a job hunt -- a job interview. Uh, uh, (unintelligible) had gone to greatlengths to get him an opportunity for a, fora job interview and had him come up-- (tape noise) talk to Dean for a minute.(Unintelligible) Bob was sitting around withthe Secretary of State in California. (Unintelligible) (tape noise) I told Finch "what's the matter with this kid?" Can'tany of us put a job but he wanted my supportfor uh, a candidacy.Yeah, Yeah (tape noise)...(tape noise) Incredible isn't it?(Unintelligible).I gotta -- And then he said no, but I dohave enough support. For instance, LenFirestone said he's all for it (tape noise)You and I and Len Firestone and some of the (tape noise) in Len's office and (tapenoise) chance.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.13PRESIDENT:Chance.MOORE:No chance except in industry, but no dice.Oh. Better plan prove a lie. So Pat saidwhat's, what's with that Kid?PRESIDENT:So maybe Dean is the, correct then.MOORE:So--PRESIDENT:Now go ahead now. MOORE:Well, in any place, Jeb is a name dropperand, I mean, just judging, from the man Iknow probably always exaggerates his role alittle bit. Likeable. Ya know did a good job in so many things.PRESIDENT:I don't know him at all.MOORE:But in this contest of credibility I would go with, uh...PRESIDENT:Dean.MOORE:...anybody, but, but Jeb Magruder.(Unintelligible) thing to know. Jeb had his part in the midst of a point where he poke John instead of defending him. I'm givingup hope on John.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Magruder. MOORE:I mean, I, I, I'm not.PRESIDENT:I'm afraid, I'm afraid. I'm afraid whatbasically they had La Rue in, La Rue by virtually the same, John's employee, he must know some things and, uh, (unintelligible).MOORE:I don't know, you know, you know everythingor do you? I know nothing. I don't know but a spectator --APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.14PRESIDENT:I don't know I, I frankly don't know--MOORE:I don't think you ought to--PRESIDENT:I'm just not going to askMOORE:...Just doesn't make any damn difference-- PRESIDENT:This doesn't make any difference I meanabout...Christ, I love all these people,they're all doing it for me, uh, er, uh they thought, but La Rue, and uh, Mardian, the rest were in the cover-up, they had to be(tape noise) (Unintelligible) Let's get backto Dean and uh. Then what happened after - remember you and he came in the office, thenhe came in alone, then I saw him at leastthree or four other times because I thought he was in charge of the damn thing.MOORE:Well, he was.PRESIDENT:And then we had him, when he went to CampDavid what happened? Were you with him there to help him write that paper.MOORE:No, no, he was up there and, right now heseemed to be quite, quite upsent. He wasall right (unintelligible) I talked to him on the phone. He called me(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:At Camp David? MOORE:He was up there for-- PRESIDENT:You know why I sent him there because he wasunder,--Everybody was out at his house and Isaid, I said,...MOORE:...(Unintelligible)APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.15PRESIDENT:...and I said "John, we need a, --Ya know,my whole view was, all, all along."Remember, Dick, let's get out a report. Wenever, there was no Dean report to correlate.MOORE:Right, Right.PRESIDENT:Let's get the whole thing out. Get all thewhole business of Segretti and the rest. He was trying to write it -- came back and saidhe couldn't write it.MOORE:He was, uh, I don't think he was in verygood form up there. I don't know what itwas. Wife was never there. Uh--but hewas--hard to describe, just had a feeling, he was, conversation with him wandered a little bit and he was ...He was nervous andconcerned (unintelligible) was involved. Hesaid, "(unintelligible) I just went walking in the woods for two hours. I can't put this together." and you know, uh(unintelligible with tape noise). I neversaw it but--PRESIDENT:I think his problem was that when he put ittogether he saw that he was involved.MOORE:This thing began to focus on and inactuality until the last few weeks he was very capable, but-some conversation; someDean said, uh, you know that, something thathe knew beforehand, before it was in the press. He said to the U.S. Attorney whichwas the first time he'd ever said that,--about Watergate. The press said he told them that he knew about Watergate.PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:So he said that would make, one person inthe White House who did know the facts who would be the author of the report.PRESIDENT:No, uh. His answer to that ' would be thathe knew that such a plan was presented but he did not know that it was approved.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.16MOORE:I see. (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Sure that could be. I didn't that's whatHaldeman told me. I kept asking him, I saidnow...MOORE:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...cause hell the moment that I knew that heknew about it, I'd have to fire him. But he never said that.MOORE:No. I meant as of, all I, know, is I sawthis third item in the paper, saying thefirst time he said that he knew what it was all about. I guess he didn't. That it waspresented, but not that it was approved.PRESIDENT:That was his, that was his story and I... MOORE:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:...am inclined to agree with him.MOORE:I, that, that's right.PRESIDENT:I'm inclined to agree with him. MOORE:I think (unintelligible) PRESIDENT:John Dean was too smart to have this manbabble on.MOORE:Somebody must have said it. I still think,at that point it still seems to me, whathappened was that (unintelligible with tapenoise) getting information these guys were going to do all kinds of things to it, protect the President, protect thesurrogates. You want to know what the,these guys are going to do to us...PRESIDENT:You're the one we're protecting, aren't you?MOORE:...and protect the Convention and Liddypresented an elaborate plan. You know (unintelligible) kidnapping. (unintelligible).APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.17PRESIDENT:Kidnapping? Well I don't know. Kidnapping.MOORE:Yeah, kidnap the ringleaders of thedemonstrators (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Have Liddy (unintelligible) MOORE:Well, he wore a shoulder holster when he wasa young attorney (unintelligible). Whatdoes that prove? What does that prove? And, uh, I thought, therefore, that what got approved was, okay, you do need a budget,you do need a (unintelligible), you do needthis work, but keep,...PRESIDENT:But they didn't approve anything.(unintelligible)MOORE:...keep, keep it within the law and we'll doit. Don't tell us anymore about it.PRESIDENT:That's, that's got to be Mitchell.MOORE:That's got to be Mitchell. Yes, and, andhe's gonna have a credibility contest with, uh, several people but, uh, particularly Magruder. Well, several people but Magruder--PRESIDENT:Magruder is, I think, a consummate liar atthe present time.MOORE:Ah, he...PRESIDENT:They can't give him immunity can they? AndI don't see how they can give Dean immunity.MOORE:Uh, I guess they could if they wanted to,but--PRESIDENT:Give Magruder immunity, I suppose. MOORE:Well, I don't know what they're... what theU.S. Attorney's Office is gunning for but Iassume they're gunning for Haldeman and possibly Ehrlichman, away.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.18PRESIDENT:I think (unintelligible) Ehrlichman(unintelligible) either top or bottom. I, Imean on a conspirarcy.MOORE:But with Haldeman they start at the top.When it began they did things, they even(unintelligible) If the Segretti rubs off(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Uh huh. MOORE:But, uh, you have, Chapin and then you haveto spell out the damnedest, three hundredfifty thousand. Did anybody show you Jack Anderson's column (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Uh huh.MOORE:And, uh, people would say how could you takethat much money out of the White House without Haldeman's approval? "I didn't sayI did it on my own." I think he did. Ah,but they'll say he authorized it. (tape noise). Dean told him to do it.PRESIDENT:You told them you needed the money and soforth. Well, coming along here...MOORE:Yeah. PRESIDENT:I look back at Dean's -Dean has now saidthey're not going to make him a scapegoat.MOORE:Yeah. PRESIDENT:I didn't notice anything this time. Wellwhat's he talking about? Who's he talkingabout? Haldeman?MOORE:Haldeman and Ehrlichman. He, he PRESIDENT:Why's he mad at them?MOORE:Well...PRESIDENT:What did they do to him?APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.19MOORE:In his defense. I think--Well, Sir,obviously he's been talking to his new wifewho said, "John, you're (unintelligible) nowthese guys pushed you into this (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:In other words that he was an agent of thosewho...MOORE:...these fellas talked you into it. PRESIDENT:Now, how was Ehrlichman in on that agent,let me tell you, in what respect?MOORE:Well... PRESIDENT:How, how do you see that? Tell me what doyou...MOORE:Well, I, I don't know, uh... PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) MOORE:...if he has any problems. Well, he was-forone thing he said this isn't gonna be madepublic--, answered "I didn't say that, I mean, you are crazy. Ehrlichman had nothing to do with all this."PRESIDENT:Ehrlichman had no prior knowledge...MOORE:That's for sure. PRESIDENT:...about any of this.MOORE:Of course, nobody here had prior knowledge.PRESIDENT:And I think -- Well, they claim Haldeman didin this respect, they say that a budget was sent over. This is the story. That it wasdropped. The, uh, and it was sent toStrachan and Strachan, it is assumed, sent it to Ehrlichman. Strachan denies evergetting a budget showing that there wasbugging in it and of course, therefore, Haldeman, of course, denies that he ever saw it, and I believe Haldeman. I don't thinkHaldeman lies.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.20MOORE:I don't think Haldeman lies.PRESIDENT:The other point is that they said that the,the, that the tape was sent over and ofcourse, Strachan says we got material that says confidential sources report, but thathe...MOORE:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...didn't know, no idea that, it was thatand, of course, Haldeman probably, then, hesaid the stuff was so useless that he didn'teven have Haldeman see it. Now that's what they said. I believe that.MOORE:I don't know what I want, but what thehell...PRESIDENT:So Dean, Dean can't testify on that point.He can't say that -- or Magruder. Magrudercan't say -- Magruder can say he sent it,but, uh, nobody can say that it got here.MOORE:That's right. PRESIDENT:Go ahead. Come back to Dean on Ehrlichman.What else does he say Ehrlichman...MOORE:Well, he starts by saying -- it goes back... PRESIDENT:YeahMOORE:Those people (unintelligible) that goes backto the Plumbers.PRESIDENT:Yes. The Liddy's. That was all in the, allin the national security area, Dick. I knowall about that.MOORE:All right. I was just... PRESIDENT:That involved -- that involved -- I knowexactly what it was. It involved the timeof the ... what the hell was it. The--APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.21MOORE:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Edgar Hoover wouldn't do Ellsberg becauseLouis, uh, Marx, the daughter was married.Marx was a friend of Hoover's. You know the story there.MOORE:Ahh.PRESIDENT:The toy man. The daughter was married toEllsberg and Edgar -- just personally -- just couldn't bring himself to get into it.So we had to do something on Ellsberg and,and the capabilities up here to try to get information on the Ellsberg case. But nowon that score... There was no bugging, Ifound. They had the FBI do bugging once it got into the case, let me assure you, but, but as far as the -- there was this crazything where Hunt goes out and breaks intothe psychiatrist's office and has a picture taken. I mean, I mean, uh, (unintelligible) look at some files and so forth. But,Ehrlichman, Ehrlichman had no knowledge of,of that particular thing. He did not approve anything like that and so forth andso on. And I don't know what-Dean's talkin'about the Plumbers. Is that it?...APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.22MOORE:He never spelled it out in all this time.we've said, this is gonna be(unintelligible) burglary rifling thepsychiatrist's files.PRESIDENT:Yeah. What else?MOORE:And, uh, then he got vague. Never--PRESIDENT:He got vague? MOORE:He mentions Krogh as having a problem Ithink it has to do with the same thing. Buthe says things'd be better off not knowing.(Unintelligible) well, by this time(unintelligible/REMOVED) see Dita Beard...PRESIDENT:Yeah, that was Hunt.MOORE:And, and then Hunt and Liddy, uh--and, and Ifelt (unintelligible) because Chuck had had the disposition of this guy...PRESIDENT:Ha, ha.MOORE:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.23PRESIDENT:Except, except Dean and he says he's notgonna be a scapegoat.MOORE:Yeah. He's gonna testify I think that...PRESIDENT:Lash out on that sort of thing. MOORE:Oh, yeah. Yeah.PRESIDENT:Don't you think so?MOORE:He might. He might. Uh,... PRESIDENT:Is that relevant in a trial? MOORE:Well, in the Grand Jury anything isrelevant. See Dean isn't going to the GrandJury.PRESIDENT:Well, I told Petersen however, toldPetersen, I said, "Now, uh, bring outanything else you want," but I said, "you cannot go into the national security area." I said that first thing. That's proper totell him, don't you agree?MOORE:I would think so. PRESIDENT:...if it was national security. MOORE:Yes, certainly.PRESIDENT:I said, I said the, uh, Ellsberg--and I toldhim exactly what this involves, this national security stuff. I said if it'sanything else, you can ask 'em anything.MOORE:I think this grand jury and this prosecutorhave so much under cover. (Unintelligible). I don't know these U.S. Attorneys, Glanzer,Silbert,...PRESIDENT:Yeah. Really tough. I don't know, that'stheir job.MOORE:Yeah, sure it is, but I don't think they'regonna be looking for stuff like that. I think they're gonna, if they can, if they can complete the Watergate and relatedthings, I think they're even gonna probablydrop, pretty much, the Segretti side of this thing.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.24PRESIDENT:Well, that's nothing, Segretti plead the,self-incrimination and what shit.MOORE:That's right. So...PRESIDENT:Now what else has Dean got on--on Haldeman?I just, I didn't--MOORE:I don't know. Well, well, uh, my problem isthat, uh, it all relates to post June, June 17 arrangements to, payments to...PRESIDENT:That Haldeman was in that?MOORE:Well, I don't know. I don't know, sir.PRESIDENT:Does Dean say he was? MOORE:Well, let me tell you what he said about,uh,--Well, at the La Costa meeting--did JohnEhrlichman talk to you about the La Costa meeting?PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.That's right. In California.MOORE:Yes. Just the background so that--let megive you the focus or perspective. We got sent for...PRESIDENT:Dean was there?MOORE:Yes. Dean and I got sent for on a Fridayafternoon, the day after the Senate passedthe resolution...PRESIDENT:Right. MOORE:...for the Select Committee. Could we comeout for the weekend to talk about the,...PRESIDENT:Right.MOORE:...the Watergate. PRESIDENT:Right.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.25MOORE:We got the airplane and we went...PRESIDENT:That was at Hal--at our initiative, wasn't.it?MOORE:Sure. PRESIDENT:I ordered that.MOORE:That's right. So, we had two people...PRESIDENT:I just wanted to be sure--the President'strying to in-, investigate this thing. I think I was.MOORE:Yes, I got that loud and clear because ourbags were packed, we were in the hall we were going to take one week at(unintelligible) we were able to divertto,...PRESIDENT:Yeah. MOORE:...to the airport. I went to California--PRESIDENT:So you went to La Costa. So what happenedthen?MOORE:Well, we had two meetings: h, one onSaturday, one on Sunday. Several hourseach. Uh, one up in uh, Ehrlichman's officeat the compound and the other one at the cottage at La Costa.PRESIDENT:You didn't see me on that occasion?MOORE:No, sir. No. You were there. PRESIDENT:I was boating. But, I didn't, they didn'tintercept me.MOORE:You were boating. This was--actually whatit wasPRESIDENT:...brainstorming.MOORE:...was, was this: Alright, you guys, theCommittee is formed, they got, they passed the resolution, what are we ready to (unintelligible).APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.26PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). Alright.MOORE:And the answer was we're not, uh, going tobe organized, we're not set up for it. Uh,we (unintelligible) yes, we're gonna be working and studying but we didn't have anyorganization, we didn't have people who dotrial, books...PRESIDENT:Right. MOORE:...and do research and this kind of thing.PRESIDENT:Right.MOORE:So, well, we're gonna see what we canexpect, we've got everything, television,the make-up of the committee, what kind ofthings, can we do anything about what counsel they get. But the first, the very first thing was, well, isn't this, I thinkthat, in a sense, a job for the Committee.Uh, the White House can't be answering every day, uh, it came to us, but through the Committee. So the Committee's got to be setup in public so they, can hire people,lawyers, (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:Yeah. That's best.MOORE:...And I remember the worst thing thatsomeone said was, "Well, have you had a lot of input from John Mitchell? Is he making plans? Is he, uh, got the Committee undercontrol?" "No, he's back in New Yorkpracticing law. We haven't heard from him at all." "Well, Dick, will you, after thismeeting, would you go up and see him andfill him in on this whole damn thing, and get him to...PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:"...some things such as hire people, getsome (unintelligible) this group,...PRESIDENT:Right.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.27MOORE:...spend all their time here.PRESIDENT:Right.MOORE:Quite a few things on the list.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible.) MOORE:And uh, so that, that's everything, well,that was set up the first day. Now, ofcourse, there was all this kind of discussion on the second day--I don't know the exact words, there was a referenceto--about Dean, "by the way, they need moremoney for those fellows."PRESIDENT:Right, and?MOORE:I don't think anybody raised it. I amparaphrasing the thing. Uh (tape noise) I. can't say, I don't know how it came up but maybe it's Mitchell's turn, maybe he can dosome of it. This was the first time thatcame, I don't know, at any rate; when in other words, (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Dean said "they need more money."MOORE:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Your recollections are Ehrlichman said tosend them to LaRue.MOORE:I don't know who Ehrlichman or Haldeman or,or, uh, now look...PRESIDENT:Or even Dean. MOORE:"Can't LaRue handle it or something of thatsort?" And it came up as to whether maybeJohn Mitchell and someone, oughta, and, and someone I think, John and this was facetious(unintelligible) said "Maybe Rockefeller canget us some money. Oh, he could always get all he wants from Rockefeller--all he has to do is ask Rockefeller, we know about that."PRESIDENT:Well, now on that...APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.28MOORE:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Money for what?MOORE:Well, I didn't ask...PRESIDENT:That's the point. MOORE:But, I sensed that, that, uh(unintelligible) on that. So it wassuggested, "Dick, you go up there, tell John, you know, relay this to him." And I didn't react or think about it particularly(unintelligible) see what they say.PRESIDENT:But, As far as that conversation isconcerned, I'm just trying to get it, youknow, in terms of the Ehrlichman, Haldeman,those participating in it.MOORE:Right. PRESIDENT:Dean says they need more money. I presumethat they could say they need more money forattorney's fees or what have you. What are they gonna--Or, was it a payoff to do something else?MOORE:No, you wouldn't say it about that.PRESIDENT:Well, that's the important thing. MOORE:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:That's a damned important point.MOORE:Yes, sir, it, it most certainly is. PRESIDENT:And Dean may have (unintelligible). MOORE:The question is, the question is what wasthe--what, what--was their prior knowledgefrom bottom to Ehrlichman and Haldeman. That there was a fund...PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.29MOORE:...that was being--had been raised and beingreplenished to compensate these fellows forwithholding or altering theirtestimony...(unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:Right. If it was for that purpose...MOORE:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:...it was obstruction. If it was for thepurpose of attorneys fees and so forth, that's a different thing.MOORE:Well, now, uh, that's, that's cheeringbecause no purpose would stick, and I didn't know what--PRESIDENT:I don't know whether I--what the law is, butI would assume that I was, I'm just guessing--MOORE:Well, I would have had the feeling that youdon't have to pay them, but look, what havewe got to do with them? Now the reason why we are paying their lawyer's fees...PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:...is that in return for (tape noise) theirfuneral oration.PRESIDENT:Well what, in effect Ehrlichman andHaldeman, I suppose, could say "Well,listen, that's not our problem, that's Mitchell's problem,MOORE:Uh, that's right.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)MOORE:That's right. PRESIDENT:I don't have to tell you.MOORE:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.30PRESIDENT:MOORE:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;PRESIDENT:That's it, that's right. (Unintelligible)that's a negative setting.MOORE:(Unintelligible) I'm trying, to, the best ofmy ability, I have not, because I can't talkto any body. I've haven't talked to John.PRESIDENT:Yeah. MOORE:Um-but that doesn't quite go to thequestion, even without my trip. What wasthat remark? What was it about? And what was your understanding? Why didn't they askwhat it was for? But, I don't know. Idon't know. I think it is I can see how these things, how you get into them.PRESIDENT:So many things come up.MOORE:I don't know what, what the knowledge was-PRESIDENT:Now, Dean, uh, Dean spoke to me as we wenton--you remember the reason that I, frankly, took him off finally and put Ehrlichman onwas that it was quite clear that he couldn'twrite his damn (unintelligible) too much about it. I didn't want to embarrass himanyway. I thought I could see motion bythen (unintelligible) I didn't put somebody else on it because I didn't want anybody to nail me. The attorney for Hunt, and uh, andhe, and then he pointed out you just can'tgo down this road (unintelligible with tape noise)MOORE:Dean, now thinks (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Dean, Dean, said, well-- MOORE:Does this, uh,--APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.31PRESIDENT:Haldeman is there, Haldeman, I mean Dean,now. This is much later.MOORE:Yes, I would like to--if I may interrupt.Uh, the first time I got the direct notion that they -were appealing through Dean formoney, for silence was about a week beforethe sentencing which--PRESIDENT:This is, much later. This is a much--Thisis toward the end of the--This is toward theend of the time I saw Dean. The last time Isaw him, as a matter of fact (unintelligible) million or something (tapenoise) at all. I said we can't, uh, I said(unintelligible) "--How long--How much did you have to pay." And he said, "a million dollars, you'd have to pay that over fouryears." I said, "you can't do that."MOORE:No, uh-- PRESIDENT:But that was when we, uh,-- MOORE:Never got (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:When we, uh, that was it--MOORE:I, I gave him a lecture on the blackmailthing when, when he planned the schedules,"I got a problem? I just got a word todaythat Hunt had been holding us up. He wants $40,000," I think that was the figure.PRESIDENT:Forty thousand for his silence, and seventythousand for his lawyers. That's what--hetold me this.MOORE:Before held been sentenced. Lots of boldtyping in escrow at the top.PRESIDENT:Yeah. MOORE:And that was a personnel--but, uh, but--APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.32PRESIDENT:You heard about that too (unintelligible) Hementioned that to me too.MOORE:I was alone with him.PRESIDENT:Yeah. MOORE:And that one (unintelligible) I didn't--I'mafraid of never stopped to think ofinstructions, I was sort of, you know--PRESIDENT:I was thinking of it either on thatoccasion. I wasn't prepared to pay any damnblackmail.MOORE:So, I couldn't say that. I said John,whoever you are talking to, and I don't knowwhat it is, tell him let the guy talk to himand get his blackmail, because once you do it, he's dead.PRESIDENT:Well, we could use the blackmail term up inthe Senate.MOORE:Well, you know, I had a client, a clientonce, who was being blackmail--and it nearly killed him.PRESIDENT:That's right.MOORE:I said cut it off now, and there's nothinghe can say at this point.PRESIDENT:Well, Dean, to his credit said that when hewas with me.MOORE:Yeah. Yeah. PRESIDENT:But I understand...MOORE:Yeah, but this wasPRESIDENT:...that was raised later and, uh, that, andthat Mitchell apparently raised the money.MOORE:(unintelligible) John wasn't(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:He did? About that?APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.33MOORE:Well, I don't know if it was that sum ofmoney, but he indi-, indicated to me oncethat, that, that--that, ah, I think it wasin that same thing I don't know--"I mean I have to call Mitchell," he said. Now thiswas after the long, long after La Costa,long after my visit, and when, John laughed about it, I said (unintelligible) -- you know John Mitchell, well, you know, you knowhow, he feels abut the younger fellows. Isaid, "there must be a program, John. We gotta get you to work at the Committee," Ilaughed when I said that and I talked to himand some other people. Do all the things he was supposed to do, about spending more time, you know. Well, you know.PRESIDENT:What'd he say about this money?MOORE:Well... PRESIDENT:... was that discussed? Were you justtalking (unintelligible) about.MOORE:Uh, no um...PRESIDENT:Dean apparently did talk to Mitchell thenabout the payoff, so he'll nail Mitchell .onthat.MOORE:Yeah. I'd say--now, among otherthings--somewhere along the line, I was a little embarrassed...PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:...to ask him. I said, uh, something wassaid about what do you need and the otherguy (unintelligible), the other guy wasRockefeller. (unintelligible/REMOVED)...PRESIDENT:(unintelligible)APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.34MOORE:...and then he said, I think he said,something--"you know after all, I am aparticipant." That, that, that was thefirst thing I'd come to feel (unintelligible) stay out of the situation.PRESIDENT:Well, let me say this, thank God we didn'thave any money. None was given.MOORE:Yeah. Yeah. PRESIDENT:But Dean did raise it. So, I guess we'rein--hmm.MOORE:Now if it came from Mitchell, then,then--this trip of mine if, you know, if I'dhad any feeling, about that oh,(unintelligible) had any sense of where me, are today, I would have called off the trip, but I didn't. I didn't (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:That's right.MOORE:But the trip, uh, the trip, it, it-- PRESIDENT:The trip to Now York. MOORE:The trip to New York to see John, toreport...PRESIDENT:But you didn't really... MOORE:...that, that...PRESIDENT:...two or three times. It just didn'tstrike you.MOORE:No. No. A little bit, but I thought ofit--the way that...PRESIDENT:(unintelligible)MOORE:It was all after the fact. PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.35MOORE:Now, I'm afraid I wasn't--the good lawyer, Ishould have. Here you know, I was playingthe public relations side. If a commitmenthad been made, then raising the money later, doesn't change anything. It's still acover-up job.PRESIDENT:Yep. MOORE:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:And if the purpose is to keep him fromtalking.MOORE:Sure. PRESIDENT:The question is that the purpose is to helpa man who's in trouble. You can do that,but you can't keep him from talking.MOORE:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Isn't that the point?MOORE:It is, but who's gonna believe we wanted tohelp these guys because we felt sorry for them, it, it..*PRESIDENT:Well, I know. That's the point: it's hardto believe.MOORE:Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, the pattern is verydisconcerting on this.PRESIDENT:That's right.MOORE:And now, the point is that there was someknowledge of what that money was for-if it was for taking advantage of the rules(unintelligible) George Bush told me,(unintelligible) the other day. He was complaining about this (unintelligible) drawhim out. "Mardian (unintelligible) to comeover and got me in the corner and said, &#8218;They're asking me for $30,000.&#8482;" The Committee. (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Jesus Christ.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.36MOORE:He said, "If they're trying to raise a fundfor these Watergaters,(unintelligible)figure out (unintelligible) what that is allabout. He was mad at that. (unintelligible). He said, he said, youknow, like so many people, he would say layit a11 out, that--PRESIDENT:He's worried as hell. We -all are. MOORE:But...PRESIDENT:And yet we should lay it all out and that'swhat we've finally done, I guess.MOORE:Well, they're not satisfied. Thismoney--the, the chief thing is--well,.Idon't know what the, fair interpretation is of the $350,000 which...PRESIDENT:That undoubtedly went, it seems to me--wedon't know, it was returned, uh, but itwent, uh,--LaRue got it as an agent, according to Haldeman, as an agent for the Committee, but on the other hand, it's cashand all that. But it went there and, uh,they, they--it certainly would be implied that Haldeman, would, Haldeman approved itfor that purpose. I mean that's whatthey're gonna try to say.MOORE:(unintelligible) and, uh, and I noticed... PRESIDENT:That's Haldeman's vulnerability.MOORE:Yeah. According to, uh, that so-calledtestimony, uh, uh, Strachan said, uh, "I did it. I decided myself to take it back."Well, that's not gonna to do (unintelligiblewith tape noise/REMOVED)PRESIDENT:(unintelligible with tape noise) go intothat.MOORE:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.37PRESIDENT:The one that, that ultimately concerns--the350 is water under the bridge.. The lastone concerns me only because of he mademention in my presence, which he shouldn't have done, but nevertheless he mentioned. Imust say that's what really triggered my own(unintelligible) for Christ's sake. Then I raised the I critical point, "How much is that gonna cost? Cost you a million dollars(unintelligible)"MOORE:This was in a recent conversation you hadwith Dean?PRESIDENT:Almost the last one I had with him.MOORE:Where he said--would, would you repeat thatwhat he said.PRESIDENT:I said what I recall was that--Dick, he wastalking about the problem, you know, I said,the problem with this thing as well the problems of the obstruction and I said "Well, what, like what?" "Well for example,Bittman has speak-spoken to me in the (tapenoise) but after that he called Mitchell, from what I gather.MOORE:He didn't tell you that before the fact.Dean told you this after the fact. After it was all over.PRESIDENT:Oh. You mean before the money was raised?MOORE:I mean at the time that I was in the stringof meetings with you and Dean.PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:(unintelligible with tape noise)PRESIDENT:(unintelligible with tape noise) what thehell did he talk about in those meetings?MOORE:We talked--the first two meetings wereexecutive privilege on our approach tothis...PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.38MOORE:...(unintelligible) committee. The, uh,third meeting, uh, nothing like this. Ageneral question, what are our tactics, whatwe should do we do about preparing.PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:Dean had some ideas such as we ought tochallenge the other Senators to, uh, put their campaign records at the disposal...PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah, he wants to take on(unintelligible)...APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.39MOORE:Yeah. And that, uh, uh, we might get somekind of material from Bill Sullivan. Theseare all tactical things that--,PRESIDENT:Yeah. Oh, I had forgotten Sullivan. MOORE:Yeah.PRESIDENT:He got a report from Sullivan and didn'tthink it was very good actually.MOORE:Yeah. Then we talked about, uh, maintaininga strong position on separation of powersPRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:...but we never got into any factual stuff. PRESIDENT:The money thing was raised with me in a.meeting where Haldeman was there. He raisedthis point about this.MOORE:Uh huh. Well, the damnest stuff open(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:No. Apparently, I think,they got it.MOORE:I think that was (unintelligible). PRESIDENT:He was not unconcerned. No. No. Later(unintelligible). Later, I think, I think,he got-I don't know. I guess they got money.I don't know. Maybe they didn't. Maybe that's why Hunt's talking. But at leastthey're--MOORE:But--if, if anybody takes Mitchell in theworst light, and looking at it, you know--If there is-- Now let me put it like this:There was some knowledge of paymentprocedure, or the need for money, uh, talking about LaCosta. And I'm nottrying...PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.40MOORE:...to make trouble for anybody, I'm tryingto put it--PRESIDENT:But then Ehrlichman could have toldsomebody.MOORE:No, no. What I'm wondering very frankly, isthey were on that, that-they're on thistrack--this, the case they're trying to make, I think, is that either Haldeman or Ehrlichman or both not--only had knowledgeof but approved and perhaps helped theobstruction operation.PRESIDENT:Right.MOORE:That they wanted to keep this, you know,(unintelligible) from coming out and were trying to protect you and...PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:...in a desperate situation they said allright, you know, go ahead and pay them off-- And if this is the case they're trying to prove, I don't know how much of a case theyhave. Uh, uh. John mentions, uh, that,that, uh, they can (unintelligible) with another (unintelligible). He thought itwas, uh, for Hunt--PRESIDENT:John Ehrlichman? MOORE:Yes, John Ehrlichman. Excuse me. Ah. Thathe thought this was for Hunt, tokeep-because otherwise Hunt was going tostart writing articles for Life Magazine toearn some money and-it's to replace that.It's not an obstruction thing. It's a caseof--PRESIDENT:Giving up thing. MOORE:Give him some funds so he wouldn't write,start writing news stories.PRESIDENT:And did Dean mention that to him?APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.41MOORE:No, John mentioned this (unintelligible)It's the kind of thing that they have tohave, I don't know where he got that but seeJohn Dean was talking -- was getting it to Mitchell at the U.S. Attorney, he told me...PRESIDENT:Yes. Sure wasMOORE:...through his lawyer who's apparentlyfriendly over there and, well, he showed me a piece of paper, uh, two or three daysbefore he, or that weekend, (unintelligible)he asked me to come out on something else. He said this -I've been talking to myattorney. Summing up what they're doingover there. He said, "here's what I see" and he had a list of indictments. He had a list of Mitchell, Dean, LaRue, Mardian witha question mark.PRESIDENT:Right, right. MOORE:...and then he had Ehrlichman, Haldeman,Colson, Strachan,APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.42PRESIDENT:How did this money thing. La Costa I didn'tknow this La Costa. And the question of,uh, the, uh, th, uh, Dean said, that what?That La Costa (unintelligible with tape noise).MOOREBy the way, uh, I got him to -- they have,there's a money problem. I can't recall the exact words.PRESIDENT:UnintelligibleMOORE:I'm not a very good reporter.PRESIDENT:Okay. MOORE:They, they need the money. Uh. Haven't gottoo much time or it's...PRESIDENT:Yeah. MOORE:...conclusion or something like that. Oneof the two, either Bob or John said, "Well,can't La Rue get, go on round and, uh, raiseit?" I, I can't remember beyond that...PRESIDENT:Yeah. MOORE:...whether somebody'd said he'd been to thewell too often, or he shouldn't or La Ruewas questionable or I don't know what it was. And then perhaps, that(unintelligible) the word which was(unintelligible) said that, sometimes, (unintelligible) I think it was facetious, said, "All he has to do is ask NelsonRockefeller, and he's got half a milliondollars any time he wants it."PRESIDENT:Who John?MOORE:John Ehrlichman said that. And someonesaid, "Well, Dick, when you see him, why don't you tell him about this." I'm not kidding. It's m problem. It's not theirs.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.43PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:Uh, I think it was the afore stated purpose.I spent five hours with John. I was there,if I'd gone up to ask him that question, I didn't need to-- I expected to be doing thewhole bloomin' thing. Before the Committee(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Now, the other fact beyond that was that,uh, Dean, let's see, uh, regarding, uh...MOORE:(Unintelligible with tape noise) excuse me, excuse me.PRESIDENT:Where were you, after La Costa. And thenthere's another time that you got Deanasking, uh, (unintelligible, with noise).MOORE:Is that about the blackmail or, or John? PRESIDENT:The blackmail.MOORE:The blackmail conversation...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). MOORE:...was in, uh, in, in March. PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:I would say probably. It was about a weekbefore the sentencing which took place around the 21st of March.PRESIDENT:And Dean...MOORE:Dean said to me., "Boy, these punks, I tellya, uh, uh, I just got word that Hunt..." and I thought he said $40,000,"is demandingthat $40,000 be..." anyway a large sum ofmoney, "be placed in his account or in escrow...APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.44PRESIDENT:...(unintelligible).MOORE:"...or deposited before he gets sentencedbecause be wants to have it there and knowit's there before."PRESIDENT:"Before he gets sentenced."MOORE:"Before he gets sentenced." And he said...PRESIDENT:After what happened. MOORE:...(unintelligible). PRESIDENT:He said that to you?MOORE:He said that to me. And I said, ...PFESIDENT:What did you say? MOORE:"John, for heaven's sake, ...PRESIDENT:This is blackmail.MOORE:I said, "This is blackmail and whoever youtalk to, whatever you're doing, tell 'em don't touch it. Uh, let this guy...PRESIDENT:And that's exactly...MOORE:... (Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:And that he reported to me. MOORE:Yeah.PRESIDENT:That's what he said to me. He said this isblackmail, $40,000. (Unintelligible).MOORE:(Unintelligible). If we do this, it's gonnabe goddamn difficult, go on forever and soforth. I -- compounding thing was something. Mitchell, Mitchell. In any conversation I've had it was whatever youdo, don't compound.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.45PRESIDENT:Fine.MOORE:(Unintelligible).APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.46PRESIDENT:After that --, we've got that -- but, ah,there was another meeting, I think, whenDean, (tape noise) Haldeman, er, met inHaldeman's office and Dean asked about that money. (Tape noise) then, uh,, uh, askedMitchell, huh?MOORE:No. I don't he never told me about this. Idon't know.PRESIDENT:Dean-- you think he asked Mitchell for themoney?MOORE:No, I don't. I told -- I would think may benot because of the way John cut it off withme, I (unintelligible) had the feeling hewasn't (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Matter of fact, it was that particular thingthat really triggered my whole -- I said,"Jesus Christ, I mean, these guys are insomething here that we gotta knock off," because I knew - I said, "Christ, you can't be paying blackmail for years for this sortof thing. It's ridiculous." Ridiculous. Isaid, "John, John is how mach is it gonna cost to keep on paying this money? Onemillion dollars?"MOORE:Anybody knows... PRESIDENT:The price goes up. MOORE:It goes up and the day comes when somethinggoes wrong and they'll spill anyway. Sojust never ending, never ending.PRESIDENT:Thank god, we got in it. We got goingthere.MOORE:Uh, uh, but, but...APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.47PRESIDENT:On the plus side, at least, we started doingsomething.MOORE:Oh, listen, I can't tell you about thereaction of the (tape noise) I talked to about the fact. We'd taken ahold, checkedhim out and, things like that --PRESIDENT:The only thing I'm concerned about is my, myknowledge of that particular thing.MOORE:Well,PRESIDENT:I didn't inform the U.S. Attorney of it atthat point, but I, of course I just had all from there, an ex parte thing from Dean.MOORE:Ya.PRESIDENT:But we, we investigated it right away. MOORE:Well, all I got from that that Dean wasasked by someone. I don't think I know bywho (tape noise) who was making that demandand I have no idea whether he ever acted on it or not. I never...PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah.MOORE:...that stuff and I gave him my speech andthat's all I know.PRESIDENT:Blackmail speech, and he gave that to me.MOORE:Ya, ya. But, but ah, what, the earliersituation, uh, that they refer to at uh...PRESIDENT:MAPRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.48MOORE:Well, it worries me in this sense that uh(unintelligible) my first intention uh,uh...PRESIDENT:But your recollections are not totally clearon that.MOORE:That's right. No, they're not. No, Iwouldn't want anybody to think they were. I do think that...PRESIDENT:Now you can't, it can't be said that eitherHaldeman or Ehrlichman did anything aboutit. They both, they didn't raise the money.MOORE:No. The whole question is,...PRESIDENT:They were aware of it.MOORE:...is whether there was any other, how werethey aware of it and, and what did this, was the pattern? Because if this comes out(unintelligible) it nay never cover anyother directionPRESIDENT:Right. MOORE:We've got Dean, who may testify, I don'tknow, I assume he has testified.PRESIDENT:Sure? MOORE:Ya, he is supposed to have said that, getthis, John Ehrlichman told me, that bedidn't make a move throughout this whole thing without consulting Haldeman and Ehrlichman.PRESIDENT:It's Haldeman and Ehrlichman?MOORE:He says Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Ya. Now,Dean is going to say he did a lot, uh,deeply involved in raising funds for the so-called obstruction of justice is the way they've been describing it.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.49PRESIDENT:Ya. (tape noise)MOORE:And it turns out that uh, with all the goodwill in the world, and uh obstructions maygo on, that case could be made against either Bob or John who may end up with anindictment and even...Ya. Think, thinkabout that.PRESIDENT:Well, then (unintelligible) I'm worriedabout in the case of any indictments thehell with the indictments. It doesn't provethe God damned case. Both of them have lawyers, and they're talking to 'em today.MOORE:Oh, now, I'm glad because I don't have to,I, I might as well talk to their lawyers.PRESIDENT:Ya. MOORE:Cause I...APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.50PRESIDENT:Right and do that. Particularly on the LaCosta thing. That's a very important thing,I, uh, wouldn't want to suggest any of perjury, but on that oneRESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258; Imean it just doesn't seem to me that--MOORE:They didn't do anything.PRESIDENT:That's my point. If they did something,, that's a hell of a lot different thing.MOORE:uh...PRESIDENT:Dean discussed the problem but well anyway,that's something else.MOORE:Well, I've been (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I didn't, I didn't frankly,, I never heardof the La Costa thing 'til today. I hadn't heard that before you talked to roe today. I'm gonna...MOORE:Well,PRESIDENT:MOORE:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;PRESIDENT:Right.MOORE:...you that, and moreover, uh...PRESIDENT:What about this? What about yourcommunication with Dean now. He's obviouslyput out a statement.MOORE:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:...that he isn't gonna be a scapegoat. Whydon't you go back and talk to him?APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.51MOORE:Uh,...PRESIDENT:Dangerous?MOORE:I don't think he would talk to me.PRESIDENT:Why? MOORE:Well, uh, first of all,...PRESIDENT:...(unintelligible)MOORE:I got the subpoena today(unintelligible/REMOVED). Dean tells methat one our staff members was(unintelligible). Well, uh, Dean knew it.He says -- The agent told me he knew it. So I went by, opened the door and said "Hey."He said, "Yes I heard." And the firstquestion I asked him is, "who, who'd you talk to at the White House about this." He said, uh, -- I said "OK," (Unintelligible)and I closed the door. Uh, now...PRESIDENT:I don't think there's a thing we can do onDean. I think Dean is...MOORE:Dean is...PRESIDENT:...out to save himself.MOORE:That's right. That statement -- PRESIDENT:But I don't know, I don't know what he cando to save himself. I don't see how. Couldyou think the U.S. Attorney can actually afford to give him -- let's put it this way, if they give him immunity, John, uh, uh, itmay save himself, but then he'll talk. Howcan they give him immunity on everything? He's the guy that -- subornation of perjuryand the other. He's got two terriblecounts, doesn't he?APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.52MOORE:Well, now being realistic, he's gonna makethe case...PRESIDENT:...that he'll nail 'em.MOORE:...that, that the power and the majesty ofthe office and then Haldeman, Ehrlichman(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yeah. Does that get you off though? MOORE:Well,... PRESIDENT:I've asked Petersen about that today.MOORE:It doesn't get you off legally, but if youget -- he's gonna get...PRESIDENT:He'll get a lesser sentence.MOORE:Well, he's gonna go for -- let's start withimmunity on the grounds that this young man who's, took a job over his head, was, got a good story on someone, something to bemodest about, became so much a, a tool ofthese uh, uh (unintelligible) and two of the most powerful men in the world...PRESIDENT:That's right.MOORE:...that, that, uh, he was led down this pathand, and ended up doing-things purely because he felt he had no choice. And theywere not, they were not, voluntary, theywere, uh, this, not the Nuremberg Doctrine now, uh, it's a doctrine of sympathy for this...PRESIDENT:Right.MOORE:...for a young man and so while we don't --under the Nuremberg Doctrine, he's, he'sguilty morally he was so young and(unintelligible)...APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.53PRESIDENT:You see the problem we got here, you see...MOORE:...(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:The problem we got here is that, uh, Deanwill say, he'll have Haldeman and Ehrlichman resign. OK. They're relying on that, ifthey fall on a sword (unintelligible). Theypoint is, let's suppose you do have them resign, fire 'em, you know.MOORE:But, but...PRESIDENT:I don't know as it cuts your losses.MOORE:Is there, uh, a treaty here? Uh, I hadthought that Mike Mansfield, for instance,or someone like that, a decent man -- nobodywants -- sorry, even an, indictment if, if two (unintelligible with tape noise) celebrated persons (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:Yeah. That's right.MOORE:...are indicted by a Grand Jury forsubornation, uh, uh, obstruction of justice, whatever it may be--PRESIDENT:What's the second set? Obstruction?MOORE:Obstruction, obstruction. (Unintelligible).And we already have a, aRESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;PRESIDENT:Right.MOORE:(Unintelligible) loss of law and order(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Correct.MOORE:Then, uh, that just by itself is...APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.54PRESIDENT:That's enough, right.MOORE:...(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:How do you mean? Why Mansfield, I mean...MOORE:Well, what I meant, was...PRESIDENT:...basically, what we have here is the judge.MOORE:Well, what's let's start off with a, uh, lead.The thought would be - what I have that if,that, that the resignation were based on,"Yes, we let, things happened, and we were atthe gate and, uh, we were, failed...PRESIDENT:...(unintelligible). We're innocent.MOORE:(Unintelligible) failed in our --PRESIDENT:"We're innocent. MOORE:"But, but we don't intend - but we let thingshappen which shouldn't have happened. Weshould have been more alert. Uh, we failedthe President and the public's entitled toexpect -- and because of the accusations anddo forth. The (unintelligible) people in highposts. there's no problem of, uh, --PRESIDENT:Well, I put that to Petersen directly. Isaid, I said, "Let's suppose they resign." I said, "Does that change the prosecution?" Hesaid, "No." I suppose he has to say that.MOORE:He has to say it at that point. Now, uh,(tape noise) had -- get some support for kindof a, uh, of a (unintelligible with noise) digin (tape noise) Mitchell.PRESIDENTI think he should come forward and say he wasresponsible for this.MOORE:Yeah. If he, if he did, uh, -- and there'd beother resignations from here and so forth.But, but, I think, in terms of the extreme, inthe public -- the, the press and variousother...APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.55PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).MOORE:That. Kind of, of, an admission of -- notguilty -- but I think that could be resigned,too, for the same reason. So I can be alittle -- in on the -- I, I, -- I hate to sayto him let him resign. I, I can do the same thing. It's alright with me. Not, not to thesame degree. I'm not on their level. Butstill that might satisfy that vultures. Uh,an admission of, of -- whatever excuses youwant to make and rationalizations.PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:(unintelligible) came in to, uh... PRESIDENT:Let me say, though who, would I have themresigning (unintelligible)MOORE:Well, now, how could we...PRESIDENT:I mean how do work that and, uh...MOORE:You've just now, uh, -- what about, what aboutan objective method. You have here a, acredibility case on the obstruction. If inthe part of this package, the Attorney Generalwould say, "These men have resigned. We've examined -- the country needs this -- I didthis, uh, they've admitted -- uh, whatever theword would be, uh, -- a it'ld have to be(unintelligible) drawn, that things havehappened. The truth has come out. I ansatisfied that to the, the, the indictment didda da da offered the possibility of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Uh, the AttorneyGeneral has examined the entire situation; hasagreed to dismiss the Grand Jury. Uh, (tapenoise) the case is a doubtful one at best.And, uh, time to get on to other things andget this case resolved."Now if you had a little sympathy of supportfrom people like Mansfield and even Humphrey,they might want to submit--PRESIDENT:Get it out of the way.MOORE:Get it out of the way and everybody would wantto try not to...APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.56PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)MOORE:...to touch the President. And by the way,nowhere, no how do I run into anybody whothinks it touches you. But if you start (unintelligible) what are you going to do.I think.PRESIDENT:I think, it'll touch me in the sense of, saythe only one -- where Dean, uh, Dean after all, we had these long conversations as, asthe thing began to unfold me andparticularly when he told me about Hunt's demand.MOORE:Well.PFESIDENT:That, that touches me. MOORE:I should have, uh, (unintelligible) -- hardtire. You had a reasonable expec -- I waswatching the date when I heard that he wastalking to you. We were wondering whether you should act...PRESIDENT:Right.MOORE:...(Unintelligible) I was meeting withZiegler and Len at John Ehrlichman's and, uh, I felt you should move pretty quick. Iwas also afraid of a headline like today'sheadline. I thought you ought to get on the front (unintelligible) which you did.PRESIDENT:We moved about the right time, I think.MOORE:(Unintelligible) sentencing demand. Wecould get it, but we could use this line.PRESIDENT:I suppose I should have walked out, lookingback, at the moment Dean told me about theforty, uh, the demand of Hunt, uh.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.57MOORE:No one could have known he'd want to use it-- this. Do we know whether he discussedthese conversations with you?PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible, tape noise) assume he has. MOORE:He shouldn't. That's going pretty far evenfor him...(Unintelligible) statement. Arewe getting any, any information as to what's going on over there? What - Kleindienst or anybody?PRESIDENT:Oh. Petersen talks to me, but I don't knowhow much he levels.MOORE:(Tape noise) The question is of what Deanhas said. (Unintelligible) effect of, let'ssay, the La Costa problem or, or, uh, you have no problem about La Costa. (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:He was going to do the reporting on it.MOORE:Oh, if you hadn't connected your thoughts onwhat to do on this subject, you. And didn't you -- I remember you went up(unintelligible) Thursday. I don't know.PRESIDENT:Yeah. MOORE:You went out on the Sequoia. I think it wasabout 9:30 and I saw the Secret Service menstanding, you were about here (unintelligible) this is something that --PRESIDENT:But that (unintelligible)MOORE:(Unintelligible)APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.58PRESIDENT:...this is at least a week, two weeks afterDean told me about the 40,000, about theHunt thing. (Tape noise) I, but I, mustsay, in that period...MOORE:(Unintelligible) Is that the 21st?That's--PRESIDENT:... in that period, I was undertaking, thenan investigation --MOORE:Sure, sure. And, uh, it was an unsupportedstatement that Dean made that triggered youinto action. See your statement said that, "Effective March 21st, I undertook a newintensive investigation." And, my gosh, I,I, know, no, I don't think you'll have any problemPRESIDENT:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;I didn't even -- I frankly didn'tknow what the Christ had been paying off ornot. It's the first time I really knew wewere paying off, I really didn't know it. I didn't know about the 350 job.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.59MOORE:Yeah. I...PRESIDENT:Haldeman has been pretty -- we never --MOORE:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:...all of the people have been pr-- theydon't bother -- hell I was ending a war anddoing a few other things.MOORE:I think everybody in the country knows thatand everybody, uh, uh, the, the (unintelligible with tape noise) they useabout the German Wall but my God they did(unintelligible) for you and they did protect you against the situation and theytook -- they let things happen and I, Icould understand it. I was right in the, in the periphery. I had nothing, uh, (unintelligible with tape noise). You had atough situation and it was too bad. But itdidn't get to you and I don't think anybody can think...PRESILENT:Thank God I didn't know. Now, I was justthinking if somebody bad told me about thisthing before, I think I would have said, "Why you stupid bastards, what the hell areyou bugging the National Committee for?" Itprobably, probably wouldn't have occurred to me to think about it all (unintelligible). I had, I was the most, I think I was themost amazed person of all at the damnedthing. I, I was floored. I thought these guys must be crazy. It's a screwy(unintelligible with tape noise) believe init.MOORE:For a long time you thought it was a(unintelligible).PRESIEENT:You know what I thought? I couldn't believeJohn Mitchell had done it. I thought it was the nuts like Liddy doin' the whole damthing. And he had the money...APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.60MOORE:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...but exceeding their authority. That'swhat I thought, Dick.MOORE:Exactly what I thought. PRESIDENT:Then when you come in to the business ofthe, uh, of, uh, -- the only thing thattroubles me about the whole goddamn thing is the obstruction thing. And the obstruction thing, I don't know that it's had all thatmuch effect. I mean, it's all coming out.MOORE:Well, I do think the thing we have to (tapenoise) whether there is any other peripheralevidence that would (tape noise) reallystick, and, uh, uh -- by anyone high up in the White House and specifically Haldeman and Ehrlichman.PRESIDENT:On what? Obstruction?MOORE:On obstruction. Cause this went on allsummer and went on all fall and --PRESIDENT:Did it?MOORE:Oh, yeah. The first day, I mean, uh, thesefellows, uh, were arrested, they didn't have any lawyers, lawyers turned up. They neverhad a money problem.PRESIDENT:But, that's, uh,... MOORE:Uh,... PRESIDENT:...that's, that's fair enough. Is thereanything wrong with that?MOORE:Well, I... PRESIDENT:Getting lawyers for defendants.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.61MOORE:Well, I think these were not our -- we, wedisowned them. They were, uh, following adetour. They were ultra vires. They were,uh,...PRESIDENT:Well, I mean, in the knowledge that it wasbeing done.MOORE:Well, like what. PRESIDENT:I mean doing it is one thing. MOORE:Now I said -- well, let's say knowledge --it is a felony uh, uh, for anybody toobstruct justice, to give...PRESIDENT:Well, I understand...MOORE:...and the reason...PRESIDENT:To obstruct justice is one thing. Butgetting them attorneys before they were convicted, I don't, I think that's anotherthing, getting their attorneys, taking careof their support (unintelligible)MOORE:Well, all right. But, the point is that, Iguess payments were made. These fellowswere getting, you've you've read about this.PRESIDENT:Yeah, about the payments. MOORE:...payments, uh and uh and the judge thing.I don't believe be didn't know where it wascoming from right away.PRESIDENT:All right. (Unintelligible) MOORE:There was, I think, money being, uh, Iassume money was being, cash was being,maybe I spoke of this agreement of the $350,000 (unintelligible) but that's whatI'm assuming and everybody else assumes it.It's a question of, of knowledge, and, and knowledge and, and Haldeman orAPRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.62MOOREEhrlichman or Moore on that, uh, uh, without(cont&#8482;d):action it's probably legal certainly (tapenoise). And uh, I I, I don't think this is,uh, (unintelligible) for him to worry about this, at least, (unintelligible) at leastbut, uh, here it is. Now this notion of a,of a treaty. Get the, get the whole thing over, now it, it won't come and get 'em here, but, uh, uh, review at this point, uh,this thing's before the world and, uh...PRESIDENT:I know. MOORE:...and, uh, I think there's...PRESIDENT:There are many that are, that are justdestroyed.Laughs.MOORE:Well, there are some, but I, but I thinkthere are enough here, possibly two. Atleast we've got to give it some more thought, uh , to , to work out a pretty, a pretty rough solution from the stand pointof the executive branch, but one that, uh,excludes you personally, one that, uh, causes embarrassment, not so much for theevils of Watergate, but ineptitude and (tapenoise) that, uh, I, I bet it's a long shot, but, but uh, I would, I would hate to see, uh, this (tape noise) our way and in fact Iknow they don't know whether the(unintelligible) on obstruction or not. Now it's impossible to prove it all. Now thatshould be proven, but Fred La Rue at thedark of night isn't going to the White House, it's uh (unintelligible). Every little thing that has had...APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.63PRESIDENT:Trouble too on La Rue. You've got Dean andMagruder, two people who are now proving tobe rather facile liars. So I think Dean'slying too, so shit. He was really running the show.MOORE:Yeah.PRESIDENT:You know that. MOORE:Yeah. PRESIDENT:At least, I told him that when we came inhere. "John, you've carried a hell of aload, you know, on this thing," which is true. But, uh, when I referred to load, Ididn't, I had no, didn't know what, what theload was.MOORE:I know. PRESIDENT:I thought) he was just keeping everythingtogether, handling Ziegler and all that kindof thing.MOORE:Mm, hmm, we certainly, we really, we can'tjust let go of that thing, that line. Wereally, I sure wish I knew what he's beensaying, because this, he probably can embellish and produce all kinds of things.Approval for this or that action.PRESIDENT:Yep. MOORE:Dates that coincide, diary entries. PRESIDENT:I don't believe, I don't know, but ah, aboutDean, but I don't believe it would serve hisinterests to go so far as to attack the President.MOORE:No. (Tape noise) I think that, uh...APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.64PRESIDENT:I don't know how he feels about me.MOORE:I, I --PRESIDENT:I, I think I've been, relative to him,considering, you know, that he...MOORE:He, He --PRESIDENT:...he wants to fire Haldeman and EhrlichmanI understand...MOORE:Yeah, yeah. PRESIDENT:...so that he goes down with them.MOORE:Yeah.PRESIDENT:But uh, what do you people think? JohnnyOstram (phonetic), how does he feel abouthis relationship with the President, Dean?MOORE:(Unintelligible) Well, invincible, or as uh,principled as people like Len Garment...PRESIDENT:YeahMOORE:...or John or Bob or some of the rest ofthem.PRESIDENT:Yeah. MOORE:I, I think -- John's a strange fellow, Idon't know much about him. You know he wentto three colleges, uh, I don't know what that happenedPRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:Had that little problem with his law firm,he...PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:...Uh...PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.65MOORE:I don't know how much principle he has.PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:If it is true...PRESIDENT:Then he might attack the President.MOORE:Well, I would worry about that. I, I -have afeeling he will attack anybody...PRESIDENT:Yeah.MOORE:...and say anything, at this point forward, ifit suits his purpose. (Unintelligible withtape noise) I was, well, we were friends Iwould say, John, we're going to come out ofthis, just keep your head and you're a lawyerand they're not going to go after you.PRESIDENT:You kept saying that to him?MOORE:Sure, but, but during the last, last week orten days he was worried about it.PRESIDENT:When, when did you last see him?MOORE:I saw him, uh, Tuesday afternoon about twentyminutes after I got that subpoena about 4;Prior to that...PRESIDENT:Before that when?MOORE:Prior to that, uh, Thursday, the week before. PRESIDENT:How was his attitude then? Scared?MOORE:The last time I saw him (unintelligible) hewas sitting there studying those yellow pagesof in- indictment, the list of those to beindicted. With his own name on it. He saidno. I've got better sources, better(unintelligible) information out of that U.S. Attorney's office than anybody. I've got acase made. I've got a case made againstEhrlichman, Haldeman, Colson (unintelligible)with a question mark (unintelligible) all theway dawn the line and uh, I don't know, Isuppose, do you think I could(unintelligible). There's a young man who'ssitting there brooding, getting ready to godown and uh, buy what he can in the way of immunity but, uh, I don't know.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.66PRESIDENT:What' s your view? Should I suggest toPetersen to give him immunity, kick the hellout of the President. Let's, I understandit isn't me personally. It's the office we've got to protect.MOORE:Now, that's right.PRESIDENT:Yeah. MOORE:But it's the office. But, but I, Iunderstand (unintelligible) I would like alittle time to think, and this soundsstupid...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)MOORE:I'm, I'm a little concerned about Petersen'srelationship.PRESIDENT:Yeah. You think he was feeding Dean-- MOORE:Yes.PRESIDENT:I'm not so --MOORE:You saw what happened to Pat Gray and I, I-- PRESIDENT:Pat Gray -- MOORE:Well, Pat Gray got in trouble for being tooclose to Dean, too subservient in giving himinformation and so forth. Uh, --PRESIDENT:So what do you mean? Petersen(unintelligible)MOORE:Well, I'm just wondering whether Petersen'sthe one to make this decision? Uh, uh, or what his role is, uh, I'm afraid that Deanmay come in. I wish we could find out whatDean had said, cause, in the summer months I think, he may say that all during the trialand during the Grand Jury investigation, Mr.Petersen was telling people what was going on in that Grand Jury room. (tape noise) It certainly undermines confidence. (tapenoise) The Criminal Division is talking toone of the prospective defendants if they tell anyone as it turns out. It's an evilsituation with the Senate.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.67PRESIDENT:Think about it, think about it withouttelling anybody in here about the situation,whether or not maybe under thecircumstances, Dean ought to get off.MOORE:I (unintelligible) completely. Of course,it's not right, but we've got to save thePresidency. e've got to save it.PRESIDENT:That's right. MOORE:And, morally, I would say this, I, make youfeel a bit better. What happened was asilly God-damned burglary exercise to, to, to get started on some egotist(unintelligible) playing at cops and robbers(unintelligible). As you said, the cover-up is worse than the deed.PRESIDENT:Right.MOORE:And no one had an evil intent, did they?They suddenly had a situation...PRESIDENT:They were trying to help, for Christ's sake. MOORE:There should not be this, uh, this budgetshould not have been lost, McGovern shouldnot have touched this, some damn fools broke into the --PRESIDENT:That's right.MOORE:So you could rationalize to whatever, thatissue about changing the Presidency. My God. So, morally, isn't it, people wentright along with it, I can see it, I've seenthe progression myself, a gradual -- take one step after another so that even Dean,uh, uh, that hardened criminal,(unintelligible) he was only a young man, and, uh...PRESIDENT:No, no.MOORE:Magruder's not a criminal.PRESIDENT:Magru-- MOORE:Mitchell's not a criminal. I think thatit's sick.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.68PRESIDENT:La Rue.MOORE:I think that guy Mitchell...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)MOORE:I think (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Well,MOORE:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Anyway, this is helpful. Think about theimmunity. (unintelligible) and let me knowtomorrow.MOORE:I will.PRESIDENT:Alright.MOORE:I, I, I, I'd like to know, uh, would you thinkabout Petersen, I I'd like to know more about whether, I don't want to see a headline thatPetersen was uh, was collaborating with Dean(unintelligible) the man. you called in hereon Sunday, and now Kleindienst says, that hedisqualified himself, and that the topprosecutor turns out to be (unintelligible)here this young man (unintelligible) Mr. Deanit just is one of those new elements that addsto the coloration quite seriously.PRESIDENT:Suppose you say if you give him immunity andthey'd say you're trying to buy him off.MOORE:And do I want a, sort of, to sit down withthis and think it through, because we don'tlook...Firstly, Magruder has done nothing thatstops you, John Mitchell, and John Mitchell,I'm afraid, is something, maybe not, but the Presidency, Dean is the key.PRESIDENT:That's right. Jesus Christ, he was making theGod damned report for me. He's the one that Irelied on.MOORE:And the man who made the report was(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:That's right. It was not written, but it wasan oral report. Ziegler would ask beforeevery pressAPRIL 19, 1973 FROM 3:45 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M.69PRESIDENTconference about John, anybody in the White(cont&#8482;d):House in --. Right? Dean said no. And Ithink it was true. But that was not withregard to obstruction.MOORE:No, the whole thing with obstruction. Well,uh, I would like to --PRESIDENT:Okay, boy. MOORE:The report came back maybe on, uh, I'll justmull this --PRESIDENT:Tomorrow about noon, what about?MOORE:Noon tomorrow is fine. PRESIDENT:Back eleven o'clock so I'll, I'll--MOORE:I, I, I'll be there on (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yes. MOORE:I'll stand by. PRESIDENT:Thank you.MOORE:Bye.PRESIDENT:Thank you. (President coughs, background noise)
