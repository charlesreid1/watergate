EHRLICHMAN:That ah -- PRESIDENT:Have you thought when you say before it gets tothe tangential thing out of the way. Have yougiven any thought to what the line ought to be - I, I don't mean a lie - but a line, on raisingthe money for these defendants?

PRESIDENT:Yup.EHRLICHMAN:Just full of them.PRESIDENT:Many who knew, but there were not so manyactors. In other words, there's a difference between actors and novices.EHRLICHMAN:Okay. Well, apparently not, because I'm notan actor, uh -HALDEMAN:Neither am I. The question there is thetestimony, I suppose.**********APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 to 2:20 P.M.61 (repl. 10/28/74)HALDEMAN,EHRLICHMAN, AndTHE PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).********** PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)...ask Dean the questionwhat his conversation with thePresident--but he can use it with the press. That's all I care about.EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:That's what we have to do (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Yeah, but, but, boy, he's just gotta betotally without honor (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:The background involving what, maybe...HALDEMAN:You have to sink awful low before you get tothat.PRESIDENT:Talked to the President about, uh $127,000we had to get or we were getting so much. Idon't know how that, why it was at that point that we were still working on money for Hunt, what, what was it we were, I don'tknow how the hell (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:That was the, that was the one that, thatBittman got to Dean on...PRESIDENT:Yeah, Dean told...HALDEMAN:...directly. And that he really panicked onit. He was very concerned...PRESIDENT:He came in and told me.HALDEMAN:...professed to be concerned becauseBittman's threat was that Hunt said that "If you don't get it to me, I'm going to tellthem all about, all about the seamy things Idid for Ehrlichman and when Dean..."PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s rightAPRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.62HALDEMAN:And when Dean hit Ehrlichman on that,Ehrlichman's immediate reaction was let himgo ahead, I have, there's nothing he canhang me on.PRESIDENTThat's right.HALDEMAN:Dean didn't want that answer, and went, wenton worrying about the money.PRESIDENT:Told me about it. HALDEMAN:Told you about it, told me about it and thewhole point, I was in here when he told you.PRESIDENT:Well, ah, good. What, what did we say?Remember he said, "How much is it going tocost to keep these three guys?" He said, &#64257;Amillion dollars." I just shook my head.HALDEMAN:Then we got into the question, if there's,if there's blackmail here, then we're into athing that's...PRESIDENT:All right. HALDEMAN:...just ridiculous and he said, he raisedthe point. Now my feeling on that pointremember that, that, Jesus, you can't sayit's a million dollars. It may be 10 million dollars.PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:Once we get into that.PRESIDENT:That's right, that's right.HALDEMAN:And that we...PRESIDENT:Ought to...APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.63HALDEMAN:That we ought not to be in this and then weleft it, you know, we can't do anythingabout it anyway. We don't have any money,and ah, it isn't a question to be directed here. This is something, relates toMitchell's problem. Ehrlichman has noproblem with the thing with Hunt. And Ehrlichman said, &#64257;Christ, if you're going to get into blackmail, the hell with it."PRESIDENT:Good. The word blackmail, thank God youwere in there when it happened, but you remember the conversation.HALDEMAN:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:I didn't tell him to go get the money, didI?HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:No, you didn't, you didn't either, did you?HALDEMAN:Absolutely not. I said, "You've got to talkto Mitchell, this is something you got to work out with Mitchell, not here, there'snothing we can do about it here.&#64258;PRESIDENT:I think we've got a pretty good record onthat one, John, at least.HALDEMAN:Ah, but there's a couple of complications hecan throw in there (unintelligible) which would be of concern, but I just can't conceive that a guy, he may, I can see himusing it as a threat. I cannot see himsinking low enough to use that. I, I just, although I must admit the guy has reallyturned into an unbelieveable disaster forus.PRESIDENT:Yes. HALDEMAN:But I can't, people don't, he's not un-American and anti-Nixon. I'll tell you whathe did, I'll tell you during that period.APRIL 17,1973 FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 PM64PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:he busted his ass trying to work this out,and it wore him to a frazzle , and I thinkit probably wore him past the point ofrationality. I think he may now be in, amental state that's causing him to do thingsthat' that ah, when he sobers up, he's going to be very disturbed about with himself.PRESIDENT:Also, he's probably got a very, very clevernew lawyer named Shaffer. I think that'spart of the problem.HALDEMAN:Could very well be.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Could very well be. But John, I can'tbelieve is a basically dishonorable guy. I think there's no question John is a strongself-promoter, self-motivated guy for hisown good, bud ah.PRESIDENT:Yet in that conversation. I, we were I wasvery, I said, "Well for Christ's sake--butah."HALDEMAM:You explored in that conversation thepossibility of whether such kinds of moneycould be raised. You said, "Well, Christ,we ought to be able to raise money.&#64258;PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:How much money is involved and he said,&#64257;Well, it could be a million dollars overthe next year."PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:I said, That's ridiculous. You can't say amillion maybe you say a million, it may be 2or 10, and, ah."APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.65PRESIDENT:But then we got into the blackmail.HALDEMAN:You said, &#64257;0nce you start down the path withblackmail, and ah, it's constant escalation,and--PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah. That's my only...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...conversation with regard to that. HALDEMAN:They could jump and then say to us, "Wellthat was morally wrong." What you shouldhave said is "Blackmail is wrong, not thatit's too costly."PRESIDENT:Oh, well, at that point that we got into(unintelligible) we went into theinvestigation.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) that's right. PRESIDENT:You see my point? We were then in thebusiness of the, this was, this was one ofDean's, when he was, ah, was it after that we sent him to Camp David?EHRLICHMAN:You sent him to Camp David on about the, ah,20...PRESIDENT:I would like to know with regard to thatconversation, Bob, I just wanted to know.EHRLICHMAN:It took place about the 23rd, that is histrip to Camp David, about the 23rd of March.HALDEMAN:When, when was that Hunt threat? EHRLICHMAN:I haven't any idea. I have no idea.PRESIDENT:Get that worked out, please.HALDEMAN:I don't know, better check on it. PRESIDENT:Well, it, oh hell.EHRLICHMAN:Well, you'll know the date of your meetinghere.HALDEMAN:Well, uh, uh, you can't --APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.66PRESIDENT:Well, (unintelligible) to say, I supposethen we should have cut it off, shut it off,because later on you met in your office and,I mean, and Mitchell said, "That was takencare of."EHRLICHMAN:The next day.HALDEMAN:That's right. UNIDENTIFIED:The same day. HALDEMAN:Maybe I can find the date by that.PRESIDENT:Yeah and Dean, Dean was there and said,&#64258;What about this money for Hunt?" Wasn't Dean there?HALDEMAN:No, what happened was, Ehrlichman and Deanand Mitchell and I were in the office, my office, and we were discussing other matters. And in the process of it, Mitchellsaid, &#64257;Let me raise one point," and heturned to Dean. He said, &#64257;Let me raise another point, ah, have you taken care of the, the, is the other problem, Hunt'sproblem?" Something like that. I don'tknow how he referred to it. But we all knew instantly what he was, what he meant andDean kind of looked a little flustered andsaid, &#64257;Well, well, ah, no, I mean I don't know where that is,&#64258; or something; and Mitchell said, &#64257;Well I guess it's taken careof." And so we assumed from that, thatMitchell had taken care of it, and there was no further squeak out of it, so I now doassume Mitchell took care of it so...PRESIDENT:Yeah, the problem I have there is I said,(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Mitchell that LaRue, as I understand it,LaRue was Mitchell's agent, but ah...PRESIDENT:Yeah, as I understand it, what I meant is,I'm just trying to seek out whether, I'mjust seeing what are Dean's lines of attackare.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.67HALDEMAN:And you're saying, "Did I know about that?"I did. Yeah, there's no question.PRESIDENT:Say, "Yes, there was talk about it and soforth, and Mitchell took care of it, but, ah, gee, but, ah, on the other hand, youmake the case as to (unintelligible)...&#64258;HALDEMAN:You can't testify to that, it'sPresidential--PRESIDENT:In this office, but not in the other office,not in your office.HALDEMAN:o.k. but in the other office the questionof, of...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...and, and the specifics never arose. Andthere again Dean is the agent on it. Dean's coming in, saying, "What should I do?&#64257;Dean's the agent on all this. That's wheremy money goes. All the input to me about the 350 came from Dead and all the output came from Dean. That's the only time I...PRESIDENT:Then Dean was the one that said, &#64257;Look Bob,we need 350 for or need the rest of the money."HALDEMAN:No, they didn't even come that way. Deansaid, "They need money for the defense."PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:For their fees.PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:And that's the, was always put that way,that's the way it was always discussed.APRIL 17, 1973 FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 PM68PRESIDENT:Right. That's why I want that line. I thinkthat's the most important thing you can work on.Get a lawyer. (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:And I said.PRESIDENT:lawyer.HALDEMAN:And I said to Dean at that time, "Well lookyou've got a situation here. We've got the 300, I thought it was 350, it was 328, in cash that we needed to get turned back to the committee."PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:Apparently they had a need for money so we have acoincidence (unintelligible)-- now you ought tobe able to work out some way to get them to takethe cash, and that will take care of our needs, and apparently help meet their needs.PRESIDENT:Right, right.HALDEMAN:Then he went back to Mitchell, and Mitchellwouldn't do it, and then they agreed to take 40 thousand of it, which they did, and shortly thereafter they agreed to take the rest, whichthey did.PRESIDENT:Do you think did you check with (unintelligible)before the election and shortly afterwards?HALDEMAN:It was not before the election, no.PRESIDENT:On that was what Dean's story was about and Deansaid it was before.HALDEMAN:Strachan.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Strachan says it was in late November, the 30th,or 29th or some nonsense like that.**********EHRLICHMAN:Incidentally, remember you told me that, ahStrachan had gone over there with Colson's partner and that the Judge wouldn't take him.
