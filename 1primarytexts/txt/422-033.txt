EHRLICHMAN:Eastland is going to postpone any furtherhearings on Gray for two weeks. Try and letthings cool off a little bit. He thinks Gray is dead on the floor.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]HALDEMAN:Gray's the symbol of wisdom, today, heaccused your Counsel of being a liar.DEAN:He may be dead 'cause I may shoot him.[Laughter]PRESIDENT:How's that? HALDEMAN:He said, "Yes"; he thinks John, he thinksJohn Dean did lie to the FBI when he said hewasn't sure whether Hunt, whether, uh, Howard Hunt had an office in the White House.DEAN:I said I had to check it out. When, uh,when the agents asked me if they could see the office -- was the way it occurred -- right after an interview. And I said Iwould have to check that out. And now it'sbeen interpreted that I was lying to the FBI about the fact that-2he had an office or didn't have an officehere.HALDEMAN:Which wasn't the question. DEAN:Which wasn't the question.HALDEMAN:[Unintelligible]. But the headline fortonight will be "Gray Says Dean Lied".PRESIDENT:If Gray had been -- Gray apparently didn'tknow what the testimony was, is what, uh --DEAN:He never really sought to find out thefacts.PRESIDENT:The question [unintelligible] earlier hejust took the question without checking onit.DEAN:The leading question -- Yeah, I think thequestion concerning the --HALDEMAN:Yeah, the, you know, the -- MITCHELL:Well, another factor, those agents may[unintelligible]DEAN:That's right.HALDEMAN:Gray said that [unintelligible] FBIinterview with Dean [unintelligible] question, he said, "I'll have to check itout" when asked if Hunt had a White Houseoffice.-3He wasn't asked that. He was asked if theycould see, see the White House office. Said, "I'll have to check that out."PRESIDENT:Well, you, will --HALDEMAN:So then says, "Did Dean lie to the agents?&#64258;Byrd asked Gray. "Looking back I would have to conclude that you were -- everything wascorrect in what you say."PRESIDENT:Yeah, but, uh -- DEAN:It's such an irrelevant point even, that'sthe funny thing.PRESIDENT:Well, as a matter of fact, uh[unintelligible] such a thing that --DEAN:They're working on it right now.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] talk to Radford?DEAN:I think so. PRESIDENT:Yeah, but [unintelligible] wasn't Grayresponsible? Wasn't Gray responsible forthat?DEAN:Well, Bull has the matter right now. I justtalked to him. He said he's quite frightened to sit down, frightened somebody is talkingto you right now because, uh, uh,-4Byrd has indicated he'd like to have all therecords of all the conversations we've had since the hearings started. How does he think you have called me, initiated thecalls, to report on their hearings -- wasn'ta problem.HALDEMAN:Well, Hunt was on the [snap fingers]DEAN:He's a very down man right now, I might sayalso.MITCHELL:Did you check the specific FBI reports? DEAN:Uh, they are trying to find it over thereright now. They are trying to find just howthe draft of the transcript originated. And,HALDEMAN:Yes.DEAN:you know -- MITCHELL:Here's the point, that some of the worstconclusions about, you know, I've tried tocut off the FBI is simply inaccurate.That's what isn't true. That's the fact that [unintelligible]DEAN:In fact that's a good point for Ziegler tosay, this sort of reminds me of too &#338;-5-UNIDENTIFIED:I know DeMarco --MITCHELL:He's plenty good. HALDEMAN:You, by the way, draw the combination, forinstance [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Well he may be feeling sorry for himself,you know, and [unintelligible]MITCHELL:[Unintelligible/REMOVED]DEAN:He's, he, he sounds down. He realized afterour conversation that, he sounded down. He said, uh, uh, and I said, "Well, I'll talk to you later, Pat," and, uh, you know,trying to show that held like to discuss[unintelligible] my voice [unintelligible], and he said, "Hold on just a minute.&#64258; "Allright, just keep the faith.&#64258; [Laughs]UNIDENTIFIED:Has he been coached by someone? DEAN:I don't think so. Dick Moore is talkingwith him right now and, and [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:What did Dick, uh, Dick, uh, say, have tosay about it [unintelligible]-6-UNIDENTIFIED:Sure. The only lawyer --UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible] want to get on the wireright quick.MITCHELL:On the specifics of what the question wasand what the response to it. Now, I think[unintelligible] Gray [unintelligible]DEAN:Uh, they got material where they wanted.The information was in the office.PRESIDENT:It was in the office? [Unintelligible] Hunt? DEAN:I never -- Down to this day I don't reallyknow where Hunt's safe was kept. Uh, Idon't think there was one -- was there?[Unintelligible]HALDEMAN:John's been over -- John's been with Zieglerthis morning.DEAN:Yeah, I left them to come over here and -- PRESIDENT:You did? You were with them. They are, uh-- DEAN:They're working on it too.MITCHELL:[Unintelligible] they're working on thespecifics.DEAN:Well, they are trying to get all the factsright now, as to what he might have reportedas to how he came up with the transcript inthe hearings, and then the frame-up.-7-PRESIDENT:You were trying to get through to -- withthe [unintelligible] Silbert -- you have to get the thing by Hunt.EHRLICHMAN:Not before the Grand Jury.UNIDENTIFIED:You mean -- ?HALDEMAN:[Unintelligible] PRESIDENT:Right. [Unintelligible]. Tell Ron[unintelligible]UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible/REMOVED]DEAN:Well, maybe in the next twenty minutes Iought to shoot back over there and, and giveher a call.UNIDENTIFIED:Shoot back [unintelligible] UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:About how long will it be?DEAN:Uh, fifteen minutes. HALDEMAN:Well, John, uh, Howard Baker just had, uh --Hunt had this [unintelligible] sort of abuddy and, uh, Bittman just had lunch withHoward Baker's Administrative Assistant-8-at the Administrative Assistant's request.PRESIDENT:The same one that saw, uh, saw Colson? HALDEMAN:Uh, I don't know that it was the same one,but I would guess. But this fellow, uh,wanted to get guidance from, uh, Timmons asto what the President was expecting out of the hearings and, uh, what, uh, he wanted totalk to him about this executive privilegebusiness and, uh, where are we going to stand on that. He expressed the personal view that the President couldn't waiveexecutive privilege, uh, which thatson-of-a-bitch [unintelligible] Ervin would accept the written interrogatories, and, andthat they would probably go to the subpoenaroute [unintelligible]. Uh, but, uh, nothing was raised about Baker being concerned that he didn't have contact -- nothing on thatother report was raised at all. Uh, but hedid say that, uh, Baker was a little pissed off at Kleindienst because, uh, uh, he had not met with him at all. He had had onemeeting scheduled which they finally wereable to set up, but Kleindienst cancelled it. And it has not been rescheduled, and soBaker has had no communication withKleindienst. The day it was scheduled was the day you had your press conference and-9-announced your executive privilege orannounced that the President with Dean and nobody would go up, which, uh, caught Baker unawares. Uh, and, uh, the disturbing thingis that his understanding is[unintelligible]the view that, uh, Kleindienst would keep him informed of this next time[Unintelligible]MITCHELL:Plus the fact they're having a meeting withthat guy, uh, as soon as he --HALDEMAN:Oh, yeah.MITCHELL:And all Weicker does is [unintelligible]Moore and Howard [unintelligible] Justice Department [unintelligible]HALDEMAN:Well he's objecting to the agreement thatthey made with Kleindienst, that Ervin made with Kleindienst, that, uh, FBI raw files would be made available to the Chairman andthe ranking member.MITCHELL:Yeah, well -- HALDEMAN:Demanding that they be -- He's going todemand that they, they subpoena the, uh,Attorney General and the Director of the FBIto produce all the files, the materials and so forth.DEAN:I talked to Kleindienst last night and heraised that.-10-And he said that he worked this out with,with Weicker, but Weicker was now dissatisfied with the arrangement. So he's going to the Chairman and the rankingminority member on the conflict.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] a letter to[unintelligible]HALDEMAN:That could be the [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] Baker's idea. He wanted totalk to Kleindienst about it, didn't want to talk to anybody else. That's the way weleft it.DEAN:[Unintelligible] I think that Kleindienstought to be aware of the fact that Baker isdistressed that he hasn't made any greatereffort to see him.PRESIDENT:Good point. Yeah. DEAN:I will.PRESIDENT:Fine [unintelligible]. Follow through andpick up on that idea. I just want -- I think you'd better do it yourself. Don't you?EHRLICHMAN:Could I suggest that, that you callKleindienst? You had the other conversation with him. Could you call him and say you'vegotten a rumor that Baker's unhappy?Because [unintelligible] nobody else can do it.-11-HALDEMAN:I think he's not really standing on histippy-toes completely.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] MITCHELL:The nature of the liaison -- he's got[unintelligible]PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] communicate back and forth. EHRLICHMAN:[Unintelligible] will not want to be inposition -- Baker does not want to be in theposition of talking to anybody in the White House.PRESIDENT:He doesn't want to talk to anybody.MITCHELL:[Unintelligible] collaborate with us.PRESIDENT:He doesn't want to talk -- HALDEMAN:But he wants to collaborate -- this A. A.was saying, he wants to be helpful, he wantsto work things out. He told the President he wanted to do that through thePRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Attorney General.PRESIDENT:That's right. Said he did want to talk toKleindienst.DEAN:Does Kleindienst know that?-12PRESIDENT:Yes, of course.HALDEMAN:Well then, call Kleindienst. UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]. Were you there?[Unintelligible]MITCHELL:What are they going to collaborate on?PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] what? MITCHELL:Well, now, what are they going tocollaborate on?PRESIDENT:Well, I suppose on such matters, uh, you mayrecall that Gray wants to, uh [unintelligible] wants the FBI; however[unintelligible] and so forth havingKleindienst [unintelligible]HALDEMAN:Well, again, I, I know exactly what thetrouble is.PRESIDENT:Oh, okay. [Unintelligible] all done.[Unintelligible] I'm the one that should do it. But you -- what Baker was thinking of,says that Kleindienst cancelled[unintelligible] I would think Kleindienst should have done it.EHRLICHMAN:[Unintelligible] broadcast [unintelligible]MITCHELL:Well, that's another thing, that, uh[unintelligible] For instance, said to Timmons, Baker was expecting all the lawyersto try to get into the confidence of SamErvin that [unintelligible]-13-HALDEMAN:Yeah, but he shouldn't be too concernedabout Baker's public statements in agreement with Ervin with, uh, that established him [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Well, he said that he [unintelligible]against it. That's what he wants to do. [Unintelligible] Okay. Well, uh, you, you'regoing to follow up about 2:30 on, on, Gray[unintelligible]. He's [laughs] a little bit on the stupid side, to be frank with you.DEAN:The prospects to let himself get sandbaggeduntil then won&#8482;t happen.PRESIDENT:You'd better counsel him about it. Theproblem with him, the problem with him,John, is, uh, with Gray, is uh, a certain stubborness [unintelligible] talk to Kleindienst. Frankly, I think too, I thinkmaybe, maybe Kleindienst ought to counselhim and talk to him.DEAN:He has, uh, and he listened to him. JohnEhrlichman talked to Kleindienst last nightand said that's where Gray was getting hisguidance.EHRLICHMAN:The whole trouble is that Dick gives himguidance which is very general. Somethinglike this comes up and Gray overreacts -- it's almost a spasm reaction. We-14-had, the other day -- whetner or not, youknow, giving them access to the FBI files.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:It was, it was the opposite of whatKleindienst told him.PRESIDENT:I know it. EHRLICHMAN:And, uhPRESIDENT:He shouldn't have even needed guidance onthat.EHRLICHMAN:Of course. PRESIDENT:Nobody -- the Director of the FBI should nothave even known -- should have even known,second nature, that, uh, you never turn over raw files to a full committee.EHRLICHMAN:I talked to Dick Saturday nightPRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:and he just was beside himself because ofthat. And, uh, he said, "Hell, we coveredthis," he says, and, uh, he was reallyobsessed on it. And I feel --PRESIDENT:Well, okay. I'll, uh -I'll tell him.[Picks up phone] Try Mr. Kleindienst,please. [Hangs up] Well, were we, uh, --What, uh, words of wisdom do we have-15-from this august body on this point?EHRLICHMAN:Our brother Mitchell brought us some wisdomon executive privilege which, I believe --MITCHELL:Technically, Mr. President, I think the onlyproblem [unintelligible] and I'd prefer youjust coming out and stating,PRESIDENT:That's right.MITCHELL:and, uh, and I would believe that, uh, itwould be well worthwhile to consider to spoil the picture to the point where under the proper circumstances you can settle withcertain former people in the White House andsome [unintelligible] [telephone rings] some of the current people at the White House[telephone rings] under controlledcircumstances should go up and, uh -- [telephone rings]PRESIDENT:[Picks up phone] Hello.Oh, Dick, I wanted to tell you, you know,on, uh, on, uh, uh, Baker that, uh, his Administrative Assistant was talking to Timmons and, uh, Baker has, uh, appreciated,you know, [unintelligible] going to make adeal [unintelligible] was good. They've not been able to, uh, have the, uh, discussion[unintelligible].-16-Well, I just wanted to tell you that, uh,you know, nobody here -- you remember our conversation regarding any discussion at all with Baker, which I think is proper, don'tyou? Now the point is, on the other hand,uh, that Baker wants -- what it means, you know, contacted, and it really depends, so &#338;I see.Really? Uh huh. Uh huh. Today.Yeah, by his Administrative Assistant.So, uh, I guess that the point is that,which we -- you see we're counting on you tobe the man there, uh, Dick, and, uh, and Iwant to keep everybody else out of this and so -- and, uh, you know, and I told Baker -- I said [unintelligible] "All right, now whodo you want to talk to?&#64258; And he said,"Kleindienst," and I said, "Fine, he's the man.&#64258; And so I left it at that, and so he's, he's running down here &#338;Yeah.Yeah. How's this -- why don't you get him on thephone, get him down there. And say, "Now,look, [unintelligible]. He's also -- it's sort of a line with Baker, now, that-17-he doesn't have any contact with the WhiteHouse officials, he didn't want that, that's not his fault -- that's not our fault. [Unintelligible] delighted except that itwould not be the right thing. And, uh, onthe other hand, in contact with you, it is essential for him to stick to your guidance.I get it he wanted everybody to come down inpublic session.Yeah. No way -- and so forth.Well, we'll keep in touch with you, Dick,uh, basically through Dean, uh, which is the best way, uh, in terms of, uh, in terms of,uh, of what, uh, of what we had done withthe Committee [unintelligible] and that those were in our guidelines. But then I think you, you really got to be our Bakerhandholder, you know. That's a hell of atough job, but, uh, I, if you have, if you have to have him move in with you, then do it, huh? Yeah, better get his wife out ofthe way and move him in. Yeah.Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I understand. Postponed -- for twoweeks? [Unintelligible]. Yeah, I know.Right, I know. Right. Right.-18-Yeah.Yeah. Yeah, apparently down here it means that,uh, maybe he's a bit phony, but, uh, theother aspect [unintelligible]. Yeah, thetrouble is, you know, is, uh, opened -- I, I understand you were as shocked as some, as Iwas that raw files had already been madeavailable to the Committee.Yeah. Did he? What do you think about it?Yeah. Well, do what you can.Incidentally, with Weicker, did you workthat thing out with him? Uh, he, he said inpublic he still hadn't written a letter, youknow -- yeah. When did you talk to him? [Cough]Yeah.I expected that.That's right. Yeah. No, you don't, you never had done thatbefore. No, that even goes further.Right. Right. But we're doing it in orderthat we get clear -- Yeah. All right, then,let's leave it-19-this way -- You'll handle, uh, you'll,you'll handle Baker now, huh? You'll babysit him, starting, like, like in about ten minutes All right. Okay.[Hangs up]PRESIDENT:We're fairly certain --You could probablyhear this afternoon. He said, he said he'scalled Baker about, oh, dozens of times, andBaker -- it seems he's out of town making a speech [unintelligible] and this trip just goes on, and on, and on. But, he'll try.He'll call him right away. He said hetalked to Weicker for an hour on the phone [unintelligible] furnishing the files[unintelligible/REMOVED]. Well, anyway, hesays he talked to him for an hour and ahalf.UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:When I talked to Kleindienst[unintelligible]. Maybe it's not Kleindienst; maybe it's Baker.HALDEMAN:I would guess that there's truth, truth tothat, too. I have always said, they'realways down here bitching about nobody calling them, nobody giving them anythingand all that. They say, "When you catchthem, you can't get to them."-20-EHRLICHMAN:[Unintelligible] catch them [unintelligible]pass the word to Colson, Webster --PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:And this --PRESIDENT:And his, and his, and incidentally, it justlooks like he -- his Administrative Assistant called Colson. Now that's whatColson informed me. And I said, "But, whatthe hell," he said, [unintelligible], but I said, uh --EHRLICHMAN:Well, that isn't a casual pitch.PRESIDENT:No.DEAN:Maybe he's looking for some -- Baker'slooking for some, some sort of a link withthe White House. Maybe that's what he'sUNIDENTIFIED:Well -- DEAN:trying to hint at. PRESIDENT:It's got to be Kleindienst. Go ahead onexecutive privilege, I suppose -- How wouldyou, uh, how would you handle it, uh?MITCHELL:All I have worked out was PRESIDENT:Work out the arrangements.MITCHELL:the best formula that we've discussed.PRESIDENT:Well, I guess under the, under the, uh,under the situation-21-that you, uh, under the statement that wehave, we're in a position to, to [unintelligible] I think we could, uh, we`re in a position to, uh, negotiate with theCommittee as to how, but we are not in aposition to have, uh, to, uh, to cross the bridge in terms of saying that Hunt andLiddy will go down and testify and thatmembers of the White House staff will testify in open, public session, or something like that. But you've got a lotofEHRLICHMAN:Formal -- PRESIDENT:other things --EHRLICHMAN:Formal is the word.PRESIDENT:Formally is the word I use. UNIDENTIFIED:Uh -- PRESIDENT:And incidentally, that's what I told Baker,too. I said, "Fine that's the term."MITCHELL:On executive -- PRESIDENT:We begin with that proposition -- I'd becomfortable there -- and see what you canget by with.MITCHELL:On executive privilege, Mr. President, staywell aware-22-that some have waived it, and the more Ithink about it [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Yes. EHRLICHMAN:And it hurts the more you do it, the moreyou --MITCHELL:The more it's less, uh, [unintelligible]. PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] Sherman Adams.MITCHELL:Uh, the point, uh, beyond which you might beable to work it out here.PRESIDENT:Yeah. MITCHELL:The, uh, the point being that this seems tobe the only way in which you get involved[unintelligible]PRESIDENT:You do.MITCHELL:I would, uh, lay out a formula and, uh,negotiate it with, with Sam Ervin or either through Baker or however else [unintelligible]. And I would, I would alsoput together a damn good PR team.[Unintelligible] made available so that the, uh, the facts can be adduced without putting on a political road show.EHRICHMAN:What about this?MITCHELL:What about the President's team? The team isimportant.EHRLICHMAN:Okay, I've written this. I can see thatChapin, for-23-instance, could appear, without it in anyway being germane to the Presidency. So I'm going to decide right nowUNIDENTIFIED:Baker --EHRLICHMAN:that --PRESIDENT:Not Baker, that'll be a little too -- EHRLICHMAN:Well, whoever you talk to. Uh, I've got areport here and I think I see where thedanger points are and where they aren't. I'd want to reserve, obviously, as to any question that might be asked.UNIDENTIFIED:Right.EHRLICHMAN:I can pinpoint some people now, but itreally wouldn't make any difference.HALDEMAN:John, do you admit there's any danger point?You admit that any one member of the White House staff can testify because it's no danger point for him, but that some otherone can't because it's a danger point with-24-him. Then what you're saying is,EHRLICHMAN:Well, but the first -- [unintelligible] HALDEMAN:then you're saying the President wasinvolved.EHRLICHMAN:I'm, I'm, I'm saying danger in the sense ofthat he could, could, could -- provocative.MITCHELL:But [unintelligible] for the sake of goingabout discussion, in other words that --Maybe we think that it's appropriate at this time to formalize John's theory on the Segretti matter and the Watergate matterbased on the documentation from the FBI and[unintelligible] FBI [unintelligible] in other words based on -- Can the Grand Jury -- what we know came out of there, the trial[unintelligible] as far as that's one incident -- whatever the record, uh, could have been available to me. This is why theinvestigation of -- we had the memorandumwith the back-up -- you know, obviously the FBI after all [unintelligible] and so forth couldn't find any-thing more. It's notexpected that you could or [unintelligible]get out by way of their interrogation [unintelligible] uh, two memorandum fromDean is important [unintelligible]appropriate time with it. John did, and say I [unintelligible] all the public-25-records [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:We've tried that though, John. Uh -- DEAN:[Clears throat] Why won't -- PRESIDENT:We still have grave doubts about it, though.DEAN:Well, I don't know --MITCHELL:I did too before, Mr. President. I, I hadsevere doubts about it. The, uh, now that,now that the facts have come out as have theFBI reports, and we have had the trial, that you have some documentation [unintelligible]DEAN:I think the, uh, the proof is in thepudding, so to speak -- it's how thedocument is written and until I sit down and write that doc -- I, I've done part "B" soto speak. I've done the Segretti thing.UNIDENTIFIED:Uh huh. DEAN:Uh, and I am relatively satisfied that wedon't have any major problems with that.All right, as I go to part "A" -- theWatergate -- I haven't written -- I haven't gone through the exercise yet, uh, in really whole-26-effort to write such a report, and I reallycan't say if I can do it -- where we are. And I, I think it's certainly something that should be done, though.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:And, uh, but we MITCHELL:You never knowDEAN:you never know until we sit down and try todo it.PRESIDENT:Now, let me say on the Watergate, that's acase [unintelligible] Segretti[unintelligible]DEAN:We can't, we can't be as complete 'cause wedon't know. All we know is what, iswhether--PRESIDENT:That's a question [unintelligible] EHRLICHMAN:It's a negative setting for us. PRESIDENT:In setting forth this general conclusionbased on [unintelligible] all thesequestions. You are -- that based on all of your consideration, uh, all of your analysis, and so forth, you, you're, youhave found and very carefully put down thatthis individual, that individual, that individual, were not involved. We're going[unintelligible] to have to presume that. Rather than going into every leaked story and other charge, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and knock this, this,-27-this, this, this, this down -- I don't, Idon't know --DEAN:Yeah, well that's why I'd like to, like to -- and I don't think I can do it until I sitdown. This evening start drafting,PRESIDENT:Exactly. HALDEMAN:I think you ought to hole up -- now that you-- for the weekend and do that.PRESIDENT:Sure. HALDEMAN:Let's put an end to your business and get itdone.PRESIDENT:I think you need a -- that's right. Whydon't you do this? Why don't you go up to Camp David? And, uh --DEAN:I might do that; I might do that. A placeto get away from the phone.PRESIDENT:Completely away from the phone and so forth.Just go up there and, uh [unintelligible] Idon't know what kind of work this is, but Iagree that that&#8482;s what you could -- see what you come up with. You would have in mind and assume that we&#8482;ve got some sort of adocument [unintelligible] and then the nextstep once you have written it you will have to continue to-28-defend [unintelligible] action.EHRLICHMAN:That would be my scenario, that, that hepresents it to you as, at, at your request. And, uh, you then publish it.DEAN:Well, that, that's --MITCHELL:That introduces the problem for us[unintelligible]DEAN:-- trial.MITCHELL:criminal trial and then appeals which may -- EHRLICHMAN:I, I know that, but I don't care. DEAN:Well you ought to be --HALDEMAN:I don't see why. You're not dealing withthe defendant's trial. You're only dealing with the White House involvement. You'renot dealing with the campaign.DEAN:That's where I first [unintelligible] PRESIDENT:Well, you can write, you could write it in awayUNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]-29-PRESIDENT:you could write it in a way that you saythis report does not re--, it's not, not, will not comment upon and so forth and so forth, but, "I -- as, as you directed, Mr.President, and without at all compromisingthe rights of defendants and so forth, some of which are on appeal, here are the factswith regard to members of the White Housestaff, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, which you have asked from me. I have checked the FBI records; I have read theGrand Jury testimony and this is it -- theseare my conclusions, chit, chit, chit, chit."EHRLICHMAN:As a matter of fact you could say, "I, Iwill not summarize some of the FBI reportsin this document because it is my understanding that you may wish to publish this.&#64258; Or, or you can allude to it in thatway without saying that flatly. You can saythat "I do not summarize all the FBI documents in this report."DEAN:Or I could say that all of the FBI [clearsthroat], it is my understanding that all theFBI reports have been turned over to the Ervin Committee. Another, another vehiclemight --HALDEMAN:And, and he has only seen half of them. DEAN:Yeah.-30-PRESIDENT:Oh, yeah.DEAN:Another vehicle might be, take the report Iwrite and give it to Ervin and Baker,PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:uh, under the same terms that, uh, they'regetting the FBI reports. Say, "Now, this has innuendo in it, little things the presswould leak from this and assume things thatshouldn't be assumed. But I want you to know everything we know.&#64258; And publicly state that you&#8482;ve turned over a Dean reportto the Ervin Committee. And then begin tosay -- the next step is, "I think that you can see that various people have variousingredients where they may be of assistancein testifying. But it is not worth their coming up here to be able to repeat really what is here in some forum where they aregoing to be, uh, treated like they are in acircus. But I am also willing, based on this document, to set some ground rules for how we have these people appear before yourCommittee."EHRLICHMAN:A case in point: the issue of whether or notI had a phone call reporting the burglary.DEAN:Right.-31-EHRLICHMAN:Now, that's all I know about the damn thingis that the Secret Service, or some policeman phoned.DEAN:But they could go on forever with you onthat.EHRLICBMAN:Exactly. DEAN:And I think it ought to be things like we'vegot in, in this report and this might be,you know, get, give it to Ervin on the confidence that we're not talking about documents being released. We're talkingabout something that's entirely facts. Youcould even [unintelligible] write a [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] accomplish our purpose ifit isn't released.DEAN:I think it, I think it -- PRESIDENT:And I, I thought the purpose -- I thoughtJohn's concern [unintelligible] I guessyou'd want him for me to --DEAN:I do, I -- EHRLICHMAN:My thought is --PRESIDENT:In other words, rather than fighting it,we're not, we&#8482;re not fighting the Committee -- we are, of course&#338;32-but what we're fighting is a publicrelations battle.EHRLICHMAN:And I am looking to the future, assumingthat some corner of this thing comes unstuckat some time, you're then in a position tosay, "Look, that document I published is the document I relied on, that's the report Irelied on and it codified and included allthe secret, uh, identification of the FBI &#338;&#64257;PRESIDENT:This is all we knew. HALDEMAN:All the stuff we could find out --EHRLICHMAN:"And now, this new development is a surpriseto me, and I'm going to fire A, B, C, and D -- now."DEAN:John, let me just raise this. If you takethe document publicly, the first thing that happens is the press starts asking Ziegler about it, inspecting the document each day."Well, why did Ehrlichman receive the call?How did they happen to pick out Ehrlichman?"PRESIDENT:That's right. DEAN:"Uh, what did he do with the informationafter he got it?&#64258; Uh, so on. Each, everyitem can be a full day of quizzing.-33-UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.DEAN:They'll just go through the document dayafter day after day.MITCHELL:Now what is your concerned judgment as towhen and under what circumstancesPRESIDENT:Another thing -- However, MITCHELL:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:let me say, that while Ziegler could begiven all those questions, I would say those are questions -- I think Ziegler should cut it off.MITCHELL:Let it die.PRESIDENT:This -- Yeah, fine. I think there should bea cut-off point which [unintelligible]. IfJohn just sort of [unintelligible] I'm notgoing to comment on the basic questions that are properly before the Committee on the [unintelligible]DEAN:Well, you, you've said you are going tocooperate with a proper investigation.PRESIDENT:Yeah, but I'm not going to comment on itwhile it is proper.-34-DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:As long as it's proper. DEAN:So why would you, why not put ourselves in aframe- work where you're way out above it?You're cooperating with this Committee;you've turned over the materials,PRESIDENT:And then, no further comment.DEAN:and no further comment.PRESIDENT:You see, I think you could get off with theZiegler business. I mean, I don't want Ziegler -- I, I was trying to pull Ziegleroff of that by my own statement, too.[Unintelligible] cooperate with the Committee, give full cooperation, but we'renot going to comment while the matter isbeing considered by the CommitteeHALDEMAN:But you don't say, PRESIDENT:unless the Committee does this and that.HALDEMAN:but you don't say that people don't give,don't release, don't publish the, uh, Dean report. Only hand it over --DEAN:-- to a proper investigative committee.-35-PRESIDENT:Well, then if you turn over the, do that,though, then can we get anything out about the, uh, Republicans putting out that much of a report? Uh, can we still get out thefact thatEHRLICHMAN:Well, the President -- PRESIDENT:there has been a report in which everybodyin the White House -- which bears out thePresident's --HALDEMAN:Ron can make the statement. DEAN:That's right.HALDEMAN:That the President &#338;-[Several voices]:[Unintelligible] PRESIDENT:John wants the statement --EHRLICHMAN:Another way to do this, and that would befor you to have a meeting with Ervin and Baker.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:That would -- I told them --PRESIDENT:Well, we've thought of that, I mean, we'vethought of that and we've tried it.&#338;36-EHRLICHMAN:But, but we didn't have a reason for themeeting. This would be for the purpose of turning over the document and discussing the ground rules. Uh, before you did that youwant to have that all agreed in advance asto what the ground rules would be. And, you've got quid pro quo here because youcould come to, to Baker, and you could cometo the Committee or to Ervin direct, and say, "Look, I'll turn over the Dean report to you, provided we can agree, uh, on howwitnesses will be treated up there.&#64258; I can,I can even, uh, construe, uh,PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:executive privilege.PRESIDENT:John, for example, if you were, uh, justtalking about executive privilege, this, this really gets down to the specifics interms of the question what do you do whenthey say, "What about Colson?&#64258; Does he go or not?MITCHELL:I think that Colson goes.PRESIDENT:He has to go?UNIDENTIFIED:Right. MITCHELL:I think Colson ---37-HALDEMAN:Everybody goes under John's -- includingEhrlichman and me -- everybody except John Dean, who doesn't go because he's, he's got the lawyer privilege.MITCHELL:I think what is happening to you and Johnand so forth with the Committee could be negotiated out of the contents of thisreport.PRESIDENT:We should negotiate it how? MITCHELL:The President's report will show that uh,your simple thought -- your simpleinvolvement was missing in the pub bill.HALDEMAN:No, it would show more on my book, I'mafraid.DEAN:But, they'll still, they'll still -- Onestrong argument --HALDEMAN:Let us, let us go. DEAN:Yeah.HALDEMAN:I, I, I don't see any argument against ourgoing if you are going to let anybody go.DEAN:That's right. HALDEMAN:Let us go. But, on the condition -- you getless trouble with us than you do with someof the others. And if it&#8482;s not -- and, now sure if you get, if you get the&#338;38-big fish up there in front of the televisioncameras, yes, I think that would be tough. I think Strachan going up wouldn't get them nearly as excited as, as John and me goingup.PRESIDENT:That's Strachan and Chapin. HALDEMAN:Well, Chapin wouldn't have to appearDEAN:Well --HALDEMAN:as a focal point, but, but, uh, uh, I think,if you could do it in executive session, uh --UNIDENTIFIED:Then I would [unintelligible]HALDEMAN:Then, then why hold us back? PRESIDENT:The executive session thing has alwaysappealed to me. Now of course, you couldsay, "Well, in terms of people coming up here, of course you have to [unintelligible] session, but you got to convin--, theCommittee feels constrained under executivesession --DEAN:We can invite the Committee down to theRoosevelt Room or the Blair House.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.-39-MITCHELL:Oh hell, you could --PRESIDENT:Yeah, you could set it at a different venue,that's true. You could put it in a different place. You could say we -- whichis what I --MITCHELL:That would be hard to negotiate. HALDEMAN:Can, can we maintain informality?EHRLICHMAN:It will never -- it would never fly.UNIDENTIFIED:Never fly. HALDEMAN:Yeah, I don't know why not. Those others goup there.UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Well, would executive session fly? EHRLICHMAN:Executive session, I suspect, would at thispoint, yes sir, yeah, I, I really thinkthese guys are concerned about this Mexican standoff that they've got, and I think they're --PRESIDENT:They'll also --EHRLICHMAN:I think that, that, the, uh -- Ervin's crackon television about arresting people crossed the line.PRESIDENT:Right.-40-EHRLICHMAN:That would take it quite a bit far.MITCHELL:In addition to that you have the problem ofthe long lengthy litigation.PRESIDENT:It's going to go on for a hell of a longtime.HALDEMAN:Ervin doesn't want that. DEAN:Let him take it on the counsel, then.HALDEMAN:That's what he doesn't want.DEAN:I know, but let him, if, if he, uh -- HALDEMAN:We have offered to do it on Dwight Chapin.That's the easy one for him.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.HALDEMAN:You got some guy who had no contact withthis [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:It was quite, it was quite clear to me that,it was quite clear to me that, uh, as long as, as long as Dean --HALDEMAN:Won't they test it?PRESIDENT:No, they didn't test it. We asked them to--UNIDENTIFIED:Find out.-41-PRESIDENT:He said let's find out. They didn't bitethat one very fast, did they John?HALDEMAN:Chapin's the guy they'd test it on. You tryto hold privilege on Chapin and that's onethey'd go to court on. They, they'd --PRESIDENT:Probably. HALDEMAN:You might do pretty well, because here's aformer employee, a guy who had no policyrole, had noPRESIDENT:-- contact -- HALDEMAN:major contact with the President, and he'dhave a hell of a time demonstrating --MITCHELL:Obviously you'll have to expect a subpoena. PRESIDENT:Chapin?MITCHELL:Yeah, because he's no longer employed.HALDEMAN:Well, because, PRESIDENT:What I'd -- HALDEMAN:because with the subpoena, if he's called totestify regarding his appointment, but not,not regarding his -- any present stuff.-42-MITCHELL:He doesn't [unintelligible] legroom. Theycan get him up there.EHRLICHMAN:Well, the precedent UNIDENTIFIED:I, I, I --EHRLICHMAN:on this is interesting. I think that hislawyer would advise him to go.UNIDENTIFIED:Couldn't get anything, couldn't do anything[unintelligible]MITCHELL:They could get him to talk. PRESIDENT:We would have to express the trust -- In thecase of a present White House employee theycouldn't get him up here, right?MITCHELL:Right. PRESIDENT:In the case of a past one you could get himup, but then he could, then he would have togo in front of the cameras and say, "I will not because of executive privilege."MITCHELLWell, they can get up with him.EHRLICHMAN:But its your privilege -- you interpose it.PRESIDENT:I see. EHRLICHMAN:And, and, uh, first we have the, the anomolyof Clark-43-Mollenhoff running up and, and, uh, tryingto give testimony in a civil service area over here now. He's running up saying, "Ask me a question, ask me a question, this is akangaroo court, and, and I waive --" Thehearing examiner just says, "Sit down and shut up.&#64258; And what's happening is that,that, the, uh, government is asserting theexecutive privilege.MITCHELL:No, they are not. EHRLICHMAN:Well --MITCHELL:Not executive privilege.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, all right -- MITCHELL:In fact you have --UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible] executive --EHRLICHMAN:All right. It's the closest thing to it.But the point is, who's privilege is it to assert? Now, what do you do if it's Chapin?I think, I, I haven't thought this -- thisis the reason I called you here to figure out what the scenario is -- but I assume what would happen is that immediately thesubpoena issued, that, that on behalf of thePresident a letter would go to the Committee saying the Executive asserts privilege.-44-PRESIDENT:Let me ask this. Uh, the, this question isfor John Ehrlichman and, uh, John Dean. Uh, now you were the two who felt the strongest, uh, on the executive privilege thing[unintelligible]. If I am not mistaken, youthought we ought to draw the line where we did. [unintelligible]. Have you changedyour mind now?DEAN:No sir, I think it's a, I think it's aterrific statement. It's -- It, it puts you just where you should be. It's got enoughflexibility in it. It's --PRESIDENT:But now -- what -- all that John Mitchell isarguing, then, is that now we, we useflexibilityDEAN:That's correct. PRESIDENT:in order to get on with the cover-up plan. EHRLICHMAN:And, as I told him, I am, am so convincedwe're right on the statement that I havenever gone beyond that. He argues that we're being hurt badly by the way it's being handled. And I am willing -- let's see --MITCHELL:That's the point.HALDEMAN:I think that's a valid evaluation, I think[unintelligible]-45-MITCHELL:See, that's the only point, the only pointHALDEMAN:Yeah. MITCHELL:where the President -- HALDEMAN:That's where you look like you're coveringup right now. That's the only thing, theonly active step you've taken to cover-up the Watergate all along.PRESIDENT:That's right.DEAN:What is? HALDEMAN:Was that. PRESIDENT:Ev--, even though we've offered tocooperate.HALDEMAN:To the extent -- and on legal grounds, and,and precedent,PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:and tradition, and constitutional groundsand all that stuff you, you're just fine, but to the guy sitting at home who watchesJohn Chancellor say that the President iscovering this up by re--, this historic re- view blankets the widest exercise of executive privilege-46-in American history, and all that. He says,"What the hell's he covering up? If he's got no problem why doesn't he let them go and talk?"MITCHELL:And it relates to the Watergate, it doesn'trelate to Henry KissingerHALDEMAN:That's right.MITCHELL:or foreign affairs.HALDEMAN:That's right. Precedent and all thatbusiness -- they don't know what you're talking about.PRESIDENT:Well, maybe then we shouldn't have made thestatement.HALDEMAN:I think we should have because it puts youin a much better position to -- They wereover here. That's what Ervin wanted. He wanted all of us up there -- unlimited, total, wide open. We -- The statement in asense puts us over here. Now you move backto about here and probably you can get away with it.EHRLICHMAN:Well, you can get away with it in theWatergate context. You see, you saidHALDEMAN:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:executive privilege would work and, andthen, then you've-47-applied it in the first instance to Gray.You said this fellow can't go.PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:And, I wouldn't change that.PRESIDENT:I [unintelligible]EHRLICHMAN:I can't -- anything about that. PRESIDENT:Great.EHRLICHMAN:Exactly right.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:At the same time -- MITCHELL:By the way isn't that [unintelligible]EHRLICHMAN: [Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:Uh --PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] one syllable names.EHRLICHMAN:At the same time, uh, you are in a positionto say, "Oh, well now this, this other case, and what I,-48-what I'm going to do there, consistent withmy statement, is so and so, and so and so."HALDEMAN:Because it very clearly -- The questionsthat the Committee properly wants to askdon't have any bearing on these people'srelationship to the President. Which they don't. The President had nothing to do withit.UNIDENTIFIED:I don't know at all. I -- EHRLICHMAN:There again, it's going to be hard to getproof. Well, it'll be hard to -- if you --You're right, we're going to need some kindof a PR campaign.UNIDENTIFIED:Yes, that's true.PRESIDENT:That's true, what?EHRLICHMAN:For the average guy. PRESIDENT:Is thinking about [unintelligible] Dean -- EHRLICHMAN:This is -- the argument will be, uh, thePresident's backed off his rock solidposition on executive privilege and is now letting, uh, Chapin, and Colson, and, and, Haldeman, and everybody testify.PRESIDENT:That the rest of us said that that'sperfectly [unintelligible]-49-DEAN:It is. I think they'reEHRLICHMAN:-- saying that there are PR problems. PRESIDENT:But people don't think so, is that right? UNIDENTIFIED:That's right.DEAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:In spite of what [unintelligible] HALDEMAN:Oh, yeah. They don't think the &#338;PRESIDENT:I agree. I understand I understand.HALDEMAN:They think you clanged down an iron curtainhere and you won't let anybody out of here, ever. That have ever worked here. Scourlady on up. It was my understanding -- Ithought from you. or maybe it was someone else -- that the Committee's operating rulesdo not permit witnesses to have counsel.DEAN:That's grand jury. I've never heard thatabout,HALDEMAN:--about the Committee?DEAN:about the Committee no, I can't believe ---50-PRESIDENT:The Committee, on the contrary, on thecontrary, committees, ever since the day I was there, they, they all allowed counsel.UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]MITCHELL:Can't imagine their not having counsel.DEAN:[Unintelligible] PRESIDENT:No sir. Committees, committees allowcounsel,HALDEMAN:If that's -- it seems to me if you're goingto do this, that becomes important in that any White House staff member who testifiesshould not only have private counsel if hewants it -- personal counsel -- but the President's Counsel should be there becauseyou're under a limited waiver of executiveprivilege and the President's counsel should be there to, to uh, uh, enforce the limitation and the witness should not haveto be in the position of saying, "That's oneI can't answer because it is outside the ground.&#64258; You or Fielding or somebody should be doing that for him.PRESIDENT:Have you -- the, the executive sessionthing?UNIIDENTIFIED:No. They, uh --DEAN:They'll bitch about that, too.-51-HALDEMAN:What are you going to hide? If you're goingto let them come up, why do you -- why is that secret?PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah. How do you handle that PR-wise?MITCHELL:You don't. One of the hazards[unintelligible] another Roman holiday like they've had with Kleindienst and Gray.This, uh, fact-finding operation -- they'reto get the facts and not to put another political, uh, circus like they have in the past.DEAN:And if -- if there were no cameras up there,there would be no reason to have it executive session because, uh &#338;HALDEMAN:Well, then they come back and say all rightwe'll do it in open session, but we'll, uh, permit television coverage.PRESIDENT:Oh no. They won't do that. That[unintelligible] their problem because oftelevision. It'll kill them [unintelligible] executive session written testimony be released.

MITCHELL:Well, they won't buy it.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, but I probably can't get away with it.[Unintelligible]. But it's a good thing to start with.UNIDENTIFIED:Sure.EHRLICHMAN:You want a bargaining position, I think it'sarguable that, uh, that all they're really interested in this, is information, and Ithink they don't need to release thetranscripts, you know.HALDEMAN:Is there, uh, an executive session of aSenate Committee -- Are other Senatorspermitted -- they are, aren't they? Any Senator has the privilege of Committee [unintelligible]UNIDENTIFIED:Yup.HALDEMAN:So Teddy Kennedy could come in and sitthere.PRESIDENT:Sure. He can't ask questions.HALDEMAN:He can't?MITCHELL:Not unless you're a member of the parentCommittee.-53-UNIDENTIFIED:Which he is.MITCHELL:[Unintelligible] HALDEMAN:But this isn't, this isn't subject -- DEAN:Select, Select Committee.PRESIDENT:Other members cannot -- whether -- that,that should be worked on too. But I -- It normally is the practice that nobody can askquestions except members.HALDEMAN:Of course, Teddy could still sit there inthe audience and then go out to the TV cameras and say, "Look [unintelligible]"DEAN:Wouldn't it be wonderful if he would?PRESIDENT:Probably we're going to have that. DEAN:I think if he did that, that would beterrific.HALDEMAN:I was just thinking that, in the membershipof the Committee, we're in reasonably good shape. The members -- the people that youhave on the Committee are not as bad asmost, as some Senators who would turn the use of TV afterwards for their own --PRESIDENT:Not as spectacular. What?UNIDENTIFIED:You know, no way, and, and, uh[unintelligible]-54-[Severalvoices]:[Unintelligible/REMOVED]EHRLICHMAN:Well, I would say [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:It's very soon that we're going to be movingon [unintelligible]DEAN:And I point out [unintelligible] PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]HALDEMAN:When do they start hearings now?PRESIDENT:The thing -- DEAN:There's no time set. HALDEMAN:How would they time that?PRESIDENT:Well, the top--, the hearings won't be -- wehave plenty of time before the hearings, but what, uh --UNIDENTIFIED:The PR.PRESIDENT:John's concerned about, the PR, we don'thave much time.UNIDENTIFIED:Well, but --PRESIDENT:You don't have much.-55-DEAN:PR is going to start on this right awaywith, with the termination of the Gray hearings for two weeks that'll let some steam out of the --PRESIDENT:Yeah. Your PR would,DEAN:Well, it'll have to -- PRESIDENT:the PR would -- What I meant is, and any--,and anyway the main thing is to do the rightthing. Don't rush too fast on the PR but, uh, uh, it'll take some time to write, uh, something. John's got to have time to writethis report. He's got to have a chance tolook at -- I guess we don't, we don't breach, we don't broach or do we broach thiswhether we have a report or not?MITCHELL:I think you can broach that. PRESIDENT:Fine. MITCHELL:Now --PRESIDENT:Let me ask you this: On the broaching ofthat, should we have Kleindienst be the broacher? The point is, who else? I can't.DEAN:That's right. Well, Kleindienst in hisconversations-56-with Ervin and Baker -- Ervin indicated thathe would like to talk to Kleindienst about the executive privilege question. Uh, maybe it's now time to get that channel re-openedagain. Uh --MITCHELL:Let me, let me make this suggestion. HALDEMAN:Write it out so, so Kleindienst said thatboth chapter and verse -- on this --UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible] UNIDENTIFIED:Without anybody else present. MITCHELL:For a first step, for a first step, you'regoing to have that meeting and we're goingto keep John out of that. But you're going to have everybody screaming about executiveprivilege going on in a committee meetingagain. And I think, well, before the Committee meeting is held, for somebody to say, "We want to discuss with the Chairmanof the Committee his concept of theappearances of witnesses.&#64258; And don't discuss it with him until you get all your ducks in a row all laid out. But, at leastyou advise them that it is a discussion ofthe subject matter so they don't come out and blast you [unintelligible]-57-EHRLICHMAN:Then ask him not to take a Committee vote onthe subject either, until --HALDEMAN:[Unintelligible] Committee locked in, butyou can work something, maybe you can workon that.PRESIDENT:Well is this the time to, uh, I mean, thepoint is, uh, if the, if the, if theCommittee -- Is this the time to[unintelligible]. That's it. Who's going to talk to him? Who's going to be there? Who do you think should do it?MITCHELL:Kleindienst talks --PRESIDENT:Talks to -- in other words to Baker andErvin, basically. That conversation shouldoccur like tomorrow. Why not? If you'regoing to move in this direction, regardless of the report. We've got to move in this direction [unintelligible] start thenegotiation.MITCHELL:Well, I think that's too much lead time.Uh, in, in the process before the Committee meeting [unintelligible]. Now, what's WallyJohnson's status?-58-DEAN:That's funny, because I -- he is still here,hasn't gone up yet, but he's been announced apparently. I gather he'll be an Assistant Attorney General. What I was thinking ismaybe to preserve my counsel role with Ervinand Baker that I ought to be present with Kleindienst.PRESIDENT:I agree.DEAN:And the four of us sit down and talk aboutexecutive privilege -- we won't get intoPRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:any of the substance.PRESIDENT:Well, the thing about your being at this,uh, is that you can keep Kleindienst, uh, uh-- I'm skeptical --DEAN:Plus they, they would appreciate the factthey're dealing with me as counsel &#338; that`s another reason I am not,PRESIDENT:That's right.DEAN:you know, when the final wire is drawn -- MITCHELL:Well, it's appropriate for the President'sCounsel to be present when the discussionstake place.-59-DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Well, all right. Now let's, let's get downto the question: How do we want to do this? How do we start there?DEAN:I would think that possibly Kleindienst, uh,ought to call today, uh, and let Ervin and Baker know that he would like to meet withthem early next week to talk about executiveprivilege, uh, indicate that I would be present to see if we can findPRESIDENT:A formula forDEAN:a formula to resolve --PRESIDENT:getting information that they desire. DEAN:That's right.HALDEMAN:It&#8482;s an unpublicized meeting.DEAN:Unpublicized. PRESIDENT:I think we'd, uh [unintelligible] go ahead. HALDEMAN:[Unintelligible] on top of that. I wouldsay early in the week. You better sayMonday so you can get them before the Committee meets.MITCHELL:And, naturally cover Watergate first.-60-PRESIDENT:I don't know how far Ervin's going to go, uh-- Ervin's insistence on letting Dean testify -- whether he might. We'd have to draw a line there, wouldn't we John?MITCHELL:I would agree wholeheartedly that you betternot go back on your final statements on the subject.PRESIDENT:That's right. That's right.UNIDENTIFIED:Even if there hadn't been statements -- PRESIDENT:That's right. But the point is, we've gotto accept the decision of JudgeByrne&#8482;s[unintelligible] on the bail. Theother thing to do on the Dean thing is say - - you'd simply say, "Now, that's out. Deanhas -- he makes the report. Here'severything Dean knows."DEAN:Right. PRESIDENT:That's where, that's why the Dean report iscritical.EHRLICHMAN:I think, John, on Monday could say to Ervinif that, uh, question comes up, "I, I know the President's mind on this. He's adamantabout my testifying, as such. At the sametime he has always indicated that the fruits of my investigation will be known.&#64258; Andjust leave it at that for the moment.-61-DEAN:One issue that may come up as the hearingsgo along, if it then becomes a focus, is, what did Dean do? Uh, as you all know I was over all over this thing like a wet blanket.I was everywhere -- everywhere they lookthey are going to find Dean.PRESIDENT:Sure.DEAN:Uh --HALDEMAN:That's perfectly proper. DEAN:But it, but -- I don't think that's bad. EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. I was supposed to be.PRESIDENT:You were on it at the first. You weredirected by the President to get me all the facts. Second, as White House Counsel youwere on it for the purpose of, ofrepresenting any people in the Executive Branch who were being questioned on it. So you were there for the purpose of gettinginformation. In other words, that was yourjob. Correct?DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Then you heard -- But, but the main point isthat you can certainly tell them that Deanhad absolutely no operational -- The wonderful thing about your position is, Ithink, as far as they're concerned &#338;-Watergate -- is-62-your position's one of, of truly of counsel.It is never, never as an operator. That's the --HALDEMAN:You can even -- In the private sessions,then, maybe, maybe, volunteer to give them astatement on the, the whole question of your recommendation of Liddy which is the onlypossible kind of substantive[unintelligible] that you could have and, and in that you can satisfy one of those arguments.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]HALDEMAN:And that you -- if you wanted to. PRESIDENT:At the, at the President's direction you'venever done anything, any operational, youwere always, always just as counsel, always just as counsel. Well, we've got to keep you out anyway: the Dean thing. I guess wejust draw the line, so we give them some ofit -- not give them all of it. I don't suppose they'd say John -- "No, we don't take him in executive session.&#64258; Would he goup in public session? What would yourfeeling on that be?MITCHELL:I wouldn't let him go.PRESIDENT:You wouldn't.MITCHELL:I would not.-63-PRESIDENT:Why not? You just take the heat of being --uh, all right. How about you wouldn't -- but on the other hand you&#8482;d let Chapin go. And you'd let Colson go.HALDEMAN:No, he doesn't.PRESIDENT:Because they're former White House people. MITCHELL:You can't keep them out of all thosesessions. Now, I want to get back to that[unintelligible] Dean spoke to Chapin; on the basis of that Chapin talked to Segretti last weekend.DEAN:Well, they can subpoena any of us. There'sno doubt about that. Uh, they, they, if they don't serve us here because they can'tget in, they can serve you at home orsomewhere. They can ultimately find you.EHRLICHMAN:I'm going to move to Camp David. PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:By helicopter.[Laughter]PRESIDENT:Go ahead. [Unintelligible] DEAN:So, the question is once you're served andyou decline, then-64-you've got a contempt situation. Now, Iwould say that it, it, it gets very difficult [sighs] to believe that they'll go contempt on people who --PRESIDENT:Present White House staff.DEAN:Present White House staff. PRESIDENT:They would on Colson. They could do that,could they?DEAN:That would be a good test case for them togo on. Uh, the other thing is, though, they could sub--,subpoena Colson to come up thereand Colson could then say, "Well, I, Idecline to testify on the basis that I think this is a privileged communication, uh, orprivileged activities.&#64258; And again you get alittle, a little fuzzier as to whether or not youMITCHELL:I'd rather not answer the question that'sasked.DEAN:That's right. MITCHELL:See my point. DEAN:That's right. There it, then it would getmuch fuzzier as, as to whether or not theycite him for contempt or not.PRESIDENT:Suppose the Judge tomorrow, uh, orders theCommittee to-65-show, show its evidence to the Grand Jury[unintelligible] then the Grand Jury reopens the case and questions everybody. Does that change the game plan?DEAN:[Unintelligible] send them all down.PRESIDENT:What? Before the Committee? MITCHELL:The President's asked [unintelligible] this.DEAN:Now are you sayingPRESIDENT:Suppose the Judge opens -- tells the GrandJury and says, "I, I don't," says, "I want them to call Haldeman, Ehrlichman andeverybody else they didn't call before."What do you say to that? Then do you still go on this pattern with the Ervin Committee?The point is, if, if a grand jury, uh,decides to go into this thing, uh, what do you think on that point?EHRLICHMAN:I think you'd say, "Based on what I knowabout this case, uh, I can see no reason whyI should be concerned about what the grand jury process --PRESIDENT:All right.EHRLICHMAN:That's all.-66-HALDEMAN:And that would change --PRESIDENT:Well, they go in -- do both: Appear beforethe Grand Jury and the Committee?DEAN:Sure.EHRLICHMAN:You have to bottom your defense, yourposition on the report.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And the report says, "Nobody was involved,"PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:and, and you have to stay consistent withthat.MITCHELL:Well, theoretically, I think you will findthe Grand Jury is not about to get out of the [unintelligible] substance.PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:Thus the danger of a grand jury is theybring indictments on the basis of --MITCHELL:Which they've studied.DEAN:Well, there are no rules.-67-PRESIDENT:The rules of evidence before grand juriesare not pretty fair at this point.DEAN:That's right. MITCHELL:Uh, when you have something that's,uh,reasoned and controlled --PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:You have attorneys --PRESIDENT:Yeah.MITCHELL:[Unintelligible] the rules of the evidencemeet.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]EHRLICHMAN:Somebody can get one in the form of aletter.MITCHELL:[Unintelligible] according to[unintelligible]HALDEMAN:Well, what would happen? Would Silbert bethe, be the, uh, prosecutor on this?DEAN:Unless the, the Court appointed a specialprosecutor, which he could do.PRESIDENT:Yeah. So, we better see tomorrow on that.But, uh, but,-68-the -- So that, if that's the case how dowe, uh -- let's move now on the first one. Now who is to call, uh, Kleindienst?DEAN:I am to follow through on [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:You going to call him and tell him what?DEAN:I'm going to tell him to call Baker first,and then Ervin, and tell them that you wouldlike to meet with them on Monday, uh, todiscuss and explore a formula for providing the information they need in a way that does not cause a conflict with the President'sgeneral policies on executive privilege.PRESIDENT:Yet meets, and yet meets their, uh, meetstheir need for information.DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:Have they requested, they've requested thatkind of a talk already, haven't they?DEAN:Yes.EHRLICHMAN:And you'll sit down with Dick, Mr.President?-69-PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah. [Unintelligible] you're goingto be so busy doing the report there will be no one --DEAN:Well, I'll work on that over the weekend,and, and, uh, actually it's good becausethings do slow down a little, over the weekend.HALDEMAN:Also write out a thing for Kleindienst sothat --PRESIDENT:I think you can talk to him. I, I think youcan do most of the talking. Get the main-Get to thinking -You can do it. Say youhave studied the subject. You also know what, what, uh, my position is.DEAN:I don't think we ought to read anything inthis first session but I think we ought to let him know that we are thinking aboutPRESIDENT:Right.DEAN:reaching some sort of --PRESIDENT:Say, "Now, what is, uh, -What would youthink here?"HALDEMAN:Well, just stay loose [unintelligible]DEAN:Stay loose.PRESIDENT:I would say, I would say, "Now look, that'swhat, that's-70-what we're going to do. We'll lay out thething about, uh, with regard to this, we want to, we want to see what can be worked out with regard to, uh, uh -- We, we talkedabout informal sessions. Is Ervin'sposition been he insists on formal sessions? Is that his position?DEAN:Well, we don't know. We've never really[unintelligible]MITCHELL:[Unintelligible] gotten into that. HALDEMAN:His response to your position -- that'sreally what you've got now --PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Ervin's response to the, to the Nixonposition and that is, "Written stuff isn'tany good. I want the body, you, you can't ask paper, you can't ask a piece of paper questions.&#64258; Okay. Now, what we're sayingmeets that requirement --PRESIDENT:The written, the written thing was in which? EHRLICHMAN:That was a, that was a, uh, Ziegler, Ibelieve.PRESIDENT:I think so.-71-EHRLICHMAN:I don't know how it came out. It's not in astatement.HALDEMAN:No, but it's a general thing. I think PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:it was in your press conference where yousaid they will provide written, uh -- I think you said it.PRESIDENT:I may have said it and I don't --HALDEMAN:In a press conference. And I think Ervin'sresponse was to that.PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:Your statement if, uh,PRESIDENT:Could have been. HALDEMAN:"These people will be happy to provide, uh,written answers to questions,"PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:"that, uh -- appropriate questions." PRESIDENT:You think -- are you sure it wasn't in thestatement, the written statement?EHRLICHMAN:No. HALDEMAN:No.-72-EHRLICHMAN:I think, I am sure wePRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:used formal, informal -- DEAN:It, it came up the first time is when Iresponded to,MITCHELL:That, that's right. Exactly. DEAN:to Eastland, I responded to Eastland'sinvitation to --PRESIDENT:You said you would furnish written -- UNIDENTIFIED:Right. DEAN:Furnish written --PRESIDENT:I think the -- I think that's where you'llfind it.DEAN:And then youand then it was repeatedafter that, uh, that we would be happy tosupply information and, uh --PRESIDENT:I think we've been [unintelligible] HALDEMAN:But, then Ervin responded -- he specificallyrejected that only on the grounds that youcan't ask questions of a piece of paper.PRESIDENT:Cross examine.-73-HALDEMAN:We need to deal with our questions. So weare giving him that opportunity. He hasn't said that the processes of the Senate require that those questions be answered in[unintelligible]PRESIDENT:What is the, what is the argument that yougive, John, to people who -- and, uh -- Whyexecutive session rather than open session?DEAN:Well, I -- PRESIDENT:You can't really give -- DEAN:I think we'll have --PRESIDENT:You can't really attack the Committee's, uh,flamboyance.DEAN:No, you can't.PRESIDENT:So, what do you say?DEAN:I think what I'd do is we'll talk a littleabout the Constitution, and I'll remind him of the position that he took so vocally inthe Gravel case,PRESIDENT:That's right. DEAN:where he came out and said that legislativeaides cannot be called to question foradvice they give their Senator orCongressman. He just went on at great length and cited executive privilege &#338;--74-PRESIDENT:Then he'll say, "This was not advice to thePresident." Go ahead.DEAN:Well, and I'll say, I'll, and I'll say that,that these are men who do advise thePresident.PRESIDENT:And that's, that's the principle involved. DEAN:And we have to draw the line.PRESIDENT:And to have the principle discussed, uh, inopen session, and so forth, is the kind of a thing where you've got to, you ought to go off to the bench, where the jury doesn'thear it, basically.DEAN:Well, I -- HALDEMAN:I don't think John or Dick should tip theirhands in the Monday meeting as to an offerto appear in executive session and get them on to the executive session wicket. It seems to meDEAN:No. No, I agree.HALDEMAN:they, they should only indicate awillingness to listen to, uh, ideas as to what would be doneDEAN:Yeah.HALDEMAN:and an open-mindedness to try and worksomething out.-75-PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Because if you get to that, that's going tobecome the issuePRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:and it seems to me that's an issue we couldwin publicly where we may not be able to win it with theDEAN:I think, IEHRLICHMAN:How about HALDEMAN:Senate, but you [unintelligible] EHRLICHMAN:What about expressing the President'sconcern about the protection of his peoplefrom a spectacle?UNIDENTIFIED:That's fine.PRESIDENT:Well, I'm also concerned about his, aboutfrankly, the, uh, having, having, uh, matters that really are a subject of executive privilege debated publicly, rather-- That's a matter that ought to be debatedprivately.DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Uh, other matters, we have no, and, and,and, without, and, and, and, and the factthat it's raised does not indicate guilt. That's part of his argument on Gravel,-76-too. The fact that it's raised does notindicate guilt. That's what we are really talking about here. But having it in public session does, uh, indicate that.DEAN:Well, I will work out a complete, uh,negotiating scenario and have thought it through before I go up.HALDEMAN:Really all your, your objective in thatmeeting is simply to indicate to them a willingness to discuss. It's notDEAN:That's right.HALDEMAN:to lay out a proposalDEAN:I, HALDEMAN:for themDEAN:I agree.HALDEMAN:to accept or reject. DEAN:I will -- MITCHELL:John, as part of that, as part of thescenario, you want to hold executive sessionfor the protection of those records.DEAN:Very true. Uh -- PRESIDENT:There, and it's the record for the future.But that's -- that maybe you can tell Ervin,maybe on a mountaintop, that,-77-that this is perhaps a good way to set up aprocedure where we could do something in the future, and all. You know what I mean?DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:Where future cases of this sort areinvolved. "We're, we&#8482;re making a lot of history here, Senator. And, uh --MITCHELL:And the Senator can be a great part of it.PRESIDENT:No, really. We're making a lot of history.And that's it we&#8482;re setting a historic precedent. The President, after all, let'spoint out that the President, uh, how hebitched about the Hiss case. Which is true, I raised holy hell about it.DEAN:Ervin away from his staff --PRESIDENT:Huh? DEAN:Ervin away from his staff is not very much,and I think he might just give up the storehimself right there and lock himself in. I,you know, I've dealt with him for a number of years, and have seen that happen and have reached accord with him on legislation.-78-HALDEMAN:That's another thing, if you don't offer himanything, you may get an offerDEAN:That's, HALDEMAN:from himDEAN:that's right.HALDEMAN:you can't accept. He'll ask you[unintelligible]DEAN:That's exactly what he'll do.PRESIDENT:And if he just takes the adamant -- Supposenow he just takes the adamant line? Nothing.HALDEMAN:Sits there and says,DEAN:I'll say,HALDEMAN:"I'll think about that." DEAN:"That's all right."PRESIDENT:You could go back --DEAN:"Doesn't sound like you're interested ininformation,"PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:"it sounds like you're interested in, infighting"PRESIDENT:Yeah.-79-DEAN:" on principle."PRESIDENT:He says, "Look, we are just going to havepublic sessions. It's got to be that or else."EHRLICHMAN:Then, "We've got a law suit Senator and itis going to be a long one."UNIDENTIFIED:That's right.MITCHELL:"How can you, you expedite your hearings?"PRESIDENT:Yeah. "If you want your hearings" -- anduh, that's the other thing. The other point is, would it not be helpful to get Bakerenlisted somewhat in advance. If that couldbe done by not begging him [unintelligible]. If we -- can we put Kleindienst to thatthing?MITCHELL:On the second step -- not on the opening. PRESIDENT:Well, even on the opening step the problemthat I have here, if Baker sits there andjust parrots Ervin's adamant thing, saying,"Hell no, there can't be anything except the public sessions," you have nothing to bargain with.MITCHELL:But Mr. President you know how theseSenators act. Baker will lay the whole thing out on the table.PRESIDENT:Yeah, I guess you are right.-80-MITCHELL:Including the contempt. They'll be --PRESIDENT:Baker, on the other hand -- Kleindienstshould at least talk to him and say "Look Howard, why don't you try to work somethingout here?" Why couldn't he say that?HALDEMAN:He could say, "We're going to try -- we wantto work something out.&#64258; "Yeah, but thenPRESIDENT:"Glad to work something out."HALDEMAN:work with us." PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:"We're, we're, we'rePRESIDENT:"Now, work, workHALDEMAN:questioning how you -- PRESIDENT:with us, but you can't, you can't be[unintelligible]. Right now, Howard, rightnow, Howard, we're just going for a law suit.&#64258; Uh --HALDEMAN:"Give us a hand and try to open this up.&#64258;That's, that's -- Baker would be fine thatmuch ahead of time.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:Be positive this time around.-81-DEAN:Don't lock yourself in. You hear every,HALDEMAN:Right. DEAN:all -- PRESIDENT:Right.DEAN:So you have another session or so, on it.PRESIDENT:Yeah. The other point is that you bereminded so you get to it. Now, justassume, however, it happens so[unintelligible] insists that [unintelligible] you just, then, then, then it becomes essential then to put the Deanreport out, it seems to me, and say, andthen have the law suit.EHRLICHMAN:We can say that if he really -- I would say,"Well, okay, then, why don't we now discusshow we frame the legal issue here?&#64258; And, uh, and,uh, "Perhaps we can at least agree on how to frame the legal issues, so thatinstead of taking three years it will onlytake a year and a half."HALDEMAN:Get it settled before this Administrationleaves [unintelligible]DEAN:They know that it's -depending upon who theyare going after and the circumstances, that they've got a tough law suit ahead of them.-82-PRESIDENT:Uh huh.DEAN:They've got to hire counsel to -- PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:It's going to cost money to brief it ontheir side. They don't have the governmentrepre-- , you know they don't have the Department of Justice to handle their case;they've got to bring in special counsel whoprobably knows nothing about executive privilege, has to be educated. Uh, get the Library of Congress clanking away at gettingall the precedents out and the like, and --We've got all that. Of course, uh, it's, it's a major operation for them to bring inand they have toEHRLICHMAN:The other way -- DEAN:get a resolution of the Senate to do it, uh--EHRLICHMAN:Fortunately, Ervin is a Consitutionalexpert.HALDEKAN:Yeah. He calls himself -- EHRLICHKAN:Self-certified. That's a ConstitutionalexpertPRESIDENT:Well, anyway, EHRLICHKAN:While you do that ---83-PRESIDENT:the, uh -- Now, uh, we could -- Have youconsidered any other poss--, have you considered the other, all other possibilities you see here, John? You,you're the one who is supposed to --DEAN:That's right. I think we, PRESIDENT:You know the bodies.DEAN:I think we've had a good go-round on --PRESIDENT:You think, you think we want to, want to gothis route now? And the -- Let it hang out, so to speak?DEAN:Well, it, it isn't really that --HALDEMAN:It's a limited hang out. DEAN:It's a limited hang out.EHRLICHMAN:It's a modified limited hang out.PRESIDENT:Well, it's only the questions of the thinghanging out publicly or privately.DEAN:What it's doing, Mr. President, is gettingyou up above and away from it. And that'sthe most important thing.-84-PRESIDENT:Oh, I know. But I suggested that the otherday and we all came down on, uh, remember we came down on, uh, on the negative on it. Now what's changed our mind?DEAN:The lack of alternatives or a body.[Laughter]EHRLICHMAN:We, we went down every alley. [Laughter]Let it go over.PRESIDENT:Well, I feel that at,uh, I feel that thisis, that, uh, I feel that at the very minimum we've got to have the statement and,uh, let's look at it, whatever the hell itis. If, uh, if it opens up doors, it opens up doors, you know.EHRLICHMAN:John says he's sorry he sent those burglarsin there, and that helps a lot.PRESIDENT:That's right. MITCHELL:You are very welcome, sir.[Laughter]HALDEMAN:Just glad the others didn't get caught. PRESIDENT:Yeah, the ones we sent to Muskie and all therest; Jackson, and Hubert, and, uh[unintelligible]-85-EHRLICHMAN:I get a little chill sitting over there inthat part of the table there.PRESIDENT:Yeah [unintelligible]. Getting pr--, I, I,I,EHRLICHMAN: Yeah.PRESIDENT:I got to handle my Canadian friend EHRLICHMAN: Right.PRESIDENT:at the moment. Incidentally, uh, you don'tplan to have, uh, you weren't planning to have a press briefing [unintelligible]EHRLICHMAN:We hadn't planned it. It wouldn't hurt, uh--PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] 3:30 with John[unintelligible]. All right.EHRLICHMAN:He is going to talk to the press tomorrow.PRESIDENT:Yeah, let's let it go. [Unintelligible] UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible] PRESIDENT:Suppose you take it, you take care of it now[unintelligible] and I won't come overthere. I -- you might, if you get-86-him waltzed around, you let me hear --EHRLICHMAN:All right. PRESIDENT:It would be my thought then that I wouldthen break it off at 4:30.DEAN:All right. Fine.MITCHELL:Four o'clock will be the minimum[unintelligible]EHRLICHMAN:I, I think both of you [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Yeah, I was thinking that we ought to, uh --yeah, I understand. But, but no, Bob, what time is the -- is my take-off scheduled for4:30 today?UNIDENTIFIED:4:30. HALDEMAN:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:Well, we won't, we won't rush.

Well,let me tell you, you've done a hell of a job here.UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:I didn't mean for you. I thought we had aboy here. No, you, uh, John, uh, carried avery, very heavy load. Uh, both Johns as amatter of fact, but, uh, I was going to say, uh, uh, John Dean is, uh [unintelligible] got -- put the fires out, almost got thedamn thing nailed down till past theelection and so forth. We all know what it is. Embarrassing God damn thing the way it went, and so forth. But, in my view, uh,some of it will come out; we will surviveit. That's the way it is. That's the way you've got to look at it.DEAN:We were within a few miles months ago, but,uh, we&#8482;re-88-PRESIDENT:The point is, get the God damn thing overwithDEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:That's the thing to do. That's the otherthing that I like about this. I'd like toget --But you really would draw the line on -- But, I know, we can't make a completecave and have the people go up, there andtestify. You would agree on that?MITCHELL:I agree. PRESIDENT:You agree on that, John?DEAN:If we're in the posture of everything shortof giving them a public session [unintelligible] and the whole deal. You'renot hiding anything.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Particularly if, particularly if wehave the Dean statement.DEAN:And they've been given out.PRESIDENT:And your view about the Dean statement is togive that to the Committee and not make it public, however.DEAN:That's correct, I think that's ---89-PRESIDENT:And say it's, uh --MITCHELL:Give it to the Committee for the purpose &#338; PRESIDENT:-- the purpose of their investigatior. MITCHELL:[Unintelligible] to limit the number ofwitnessesPRESIDENT:Yeah. MITCHELL:which are called up there, instead of abuck-shot operation.PRESIDENT:And say here, and also say, "This may helpyou in your investigation.&#64258;MITCHELL:Right.PRESIDENT:"This is everything we know, Mr. Senator.&#64258;That's what I was preparing to say. "This is everything we know; I know nothing more.This is the whole purpose, and that's that.If you need any further information, my, our counsel will furnish it, uh, that is not in here." It'd be tempting to -- " But this isall we know. Now, in addition to that, youare welcome to have, have people, but you've got to have" -- I think that the best way to have it is in executive session, but-90-incidentally, you say executive session forthose out of government as well as in?MITCHELL:That's right. PRESIDENT:Chapin and Colson should be called in.DEAN:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:I would think so. MITCHELL:Sure. Because you have the same problem.PRESIDENT:You see we ask -- but your point -- we askfor, uh, the privilege, and at least, you know, we, we, our statement said it applies to former as well as present[unintelligible]DEAN:Now, our statement -- you Leave a lot offlexibility that you normally -- for onething, taking the chance appearing, and uh,however, informal relationships will always be worked out [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Informal relations.DEAN:That's right.MITCHELL:You have the same basis ---91-PRESIDENT:Well, it might. When I say that, that, that-- the written interrogatory thing is not as clear [unintelligible] maybe Ervin is making it that way, but I think that's based onwhat maybe, uh, we said that the -- I don'tthink I said we would only write, in, in the press conference, written interrogatories.DEAN:That's right. I don't think --PRESIDENT:I didn't say that at all. DEAN:Ervin just jumped to that conclusion as aresult of my letter to, uh --PRESIDENT:I think that's what it was.DEAN:I think that's what's happened. PRESIDENT:Not that your letter was wrong -- it wasright. But, uh, the whole writteninterrogatory, we didn't discuss other possibilities.MITCHELL:With respect to your ex-employees, you havethe same problem of getting into areas ofprivileged communications. You certainly can make a good case for keeping them in executive session.-92-PRESIDENT:That's right.MITCHELL:[Unintelligible] PRESIDENT:And, and in this sense the precedent forworking -- you can do it in cases in thefuture, which [unintelligible] executivesession, and then the privilege can be raised without having, uh, on a legal basis,without having the guilt by the FifthAmendment, not like pleading the Fifth Amendment --MITHCELL:Right.PRESIDENT:the implication always being raised.MITCHELL:[Unintelligible] and self-protection in thatview?PRESIDENT:What? Yeah.DEAN:[Unintelligible] Fifth Amendment. PRESIDENT:That's right. That's what we're going to dohere.MITCHELL:Those -- boy, this thing has to be turnedaround. Got to get you off the lid.PRESIDENT:Right DEAN:All right.PRESIDENT:All right, fine, Chuck.MITHCELL:Good to see you. PRESIDENT:How long were you in Florida? Just, uh &#338;--93-MITCHELL:I was down there overnight. I was fourhours on the witness stand testifying for the government in these, uh, racket cases involving wiretapping. The God damn foolJudge down there let them go all over thelot and ask me any questions that they wanted to. Just ridiculous. You know, thishad, all has to do with the discretionaryact of signing a piece of paper that I'm authorized by the statute. There were twenty-seven hood lawyers that questionedme.PRESIDENT:You know, uh, the, uh, you, you can say whenI [unintelligible] I was going to say thatthe, uh -- [Picks up phone] Can you get mePrime Minister Trudeau in Canada, please. [Hangs up] I was going to say that Dean has really been, uh, something on this.MITCHELL:That he has, Mr. President, no questionabout it, he's a very --PRESIDENT:Son-of-a-bitching tough thing. MITCHELL:You've got a very solid guy that's handledsome tough things. And, I also want to saythese lawyers that you have think very highly of him. I know that John spends histime with certain ones &#338;-94-PRESIDENT:Dean? Discipline is very high.MITCHELL:Parkinson, O'Brien. PRESIDENT:Yes, Dean says it's great. Well, you know Ifeel for all the people, you know, I meaneverybody that's involved. Hell, is allwe're doing is their best to [unintelligible] and so forth.[Unintelligible]. That's, that's why Ican't let you go, go down. John? It's all right. Come in.DEAN:Uh --PRESIDENT:Did you find out anything?DEAN:I was, I went over to Ziegler's office.They have an office over there. PaulO'Brien'll be down here in a little while tosee you. I'm going over to Ziegler's office and finish this up now.MITCHELL:Are you coming back?DEAN:Yes, I'll come back over here then.MITCHELL:Okay. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well, when you come back -- he can,uh, is that office open for John now?-95-DEAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:Then he can go over there as soon[unintelligible] this. But, uh, the, uh, the one thing I don't want to do is to --Now let me make this clear. I, I, I thoughtit was, uh, very, uh, very cruel thing as it turned out -- although at the time I had totell [unintelligible] -- what happened toAdams. I don't want it to happen with Watergate -- the Watergate matter. I think he made a, made a mistake, but he shouldn'thave been sacked, he shouldn't have been -- And, uh, for that reason, I am perfectly willing to -- I don't give a shit whathappens. I want you all to stonewall it,let them plead the Fifth Amendment, cover-up or anything else, if it'll save it -- save the plan. That's the whole point. On theother hand, uh, uh, I would prefer, as Isaid to you, that you do it the other way. And I would particularly prefer to do it that other way if it's going to come outthat way anyway. And that my view, that,uh, with the number of jackass people that they've got that they can call, they'regoing to -- The story they get out throughleaks, charges, and so forth, and innuendos, will be a hell of a lot worse than the story they're going to get out by just letting itout there.-96-MITCHELL:Well --PRESIDENT:I don't know. But that's, uh, you know, upto this point, the whole theory has been containment, as you know, John.MITCHELL:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And now, now we're shifting. As far as I'mconcerned, actually from a personalstandpoint, if you weren't making a personalsacrifice -- it's unfair -- Haldeman and Dean. That's what Eisenhower -- that's all he cared about. He only cared about -- Christ, &#64257;Be sure he was clean.&#64258; Both in thefund thing and the Adams thing. But I don't look at it that way. And I just -- That'sthe thing I am really concerned with. We'regoing to protect our people, if we can.MITCHELL:Well, the important thing is to get you upabove it for this first operation. And thento see where the chips fall and, uh, and,uh, get through this Grand Jury thing up here. Uh, then the Committee is another question. [Telephone rings] What we oughtto have is a reading as to what is[telephone rings] coming out of this Committee and we, if we handle the cards asit progresses. [Telephone rings]PRESIDENT:Yeah. But anyway, we'll go on. And, uh, Ithink in order -- it'll probably turn just as well, getting them in the position of,even though it hurts for a little while.-97-MITCHELL:Yeah.PRESIDENT:You know what I mean. People say, "Well,the President's [unintelligible]," and so forth. Nothing is lasting. You know peopleget so disturbed about [unintelligible].Now, when we do move [unintelligible] we can move, in a, in a, in a, in the proper way.MITCHELL:If you can do it in a controlled way itwould help and good, but, but, but the other thing you have to remember is that this stuff is going to come out of thatCommittee, whether --PRESIDENT:That's right. MITCHELL:And it's going to come out no matter what.PRESIDENT:As if, as if I, and then it looks like Itried to keep it from coming out.MITCHELL:That's why it's important that thatstatement go up to the Committee.PRESIDENT:[Picks up phone] Hello. I don't want totalk. Sure. [Hangs up] Christ. Sure, we'll --MITCHELL:It's like these Gray, Gray hearings. Theyhad it five days running that the files wereturned over to John Dean, just five days running -- the same story.-98-PRESIDENT:Same story.MITCHELL:Right. PRESIDENT:The files should have been turned over. MITCHELL:Just should have, should have demanded them.You should have demanded all of them.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] what the hell was he doingas Counsel to the President without gettingthem? He was -- I told him to conduct aninvestigation, and he did.MITCHELL:I know. PRESIDENT:Well, it's like everything else.MITCHELL:Anything else for us to --PRESIDENT:Get on that other thing. If Baker can --Baker is not proving much of a reed up tothis point. He's smart enough.MITCHELL:Howard is smart enough, but, uh, we've gotto carry him. Uh, I think he has and I've been puzzling over a way to have a liaisonwith him and, and, uh &#338;-99-PRESIDENT:He won't talk on the phone with anybodyaccording to Kleindienst. He thinks his phone is tapped.MITCHELL:He does?PRESIDENT:Who's tapping his phone?MITCHELL:I don't know. PRESIDENT:Who would he think, who would he think wouldtap his phone? I guess maybe that we would.MITCHELL:I don't doubt that. PRESIDENT:He must think that Ervin -- MITCHELL:Maybe.PRESIDENT:Or, or a newspaper.MITCHELL:Newspaper, or, or the Democratic Party, orsomebody. There's got to be somebody toliaison with Kleindienst to get in aposition where -- It's all right from fore- knowledge through Kleindienst.-100-PRESIDENT:You really wonder if you take Wally Johnsonand, uh -- He's a pretty good boy, isn't he?MITCHELL:Yeah.
