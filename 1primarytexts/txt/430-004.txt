JOHN EHRLICHMAN AND H.R. HALDEMAN ON APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO1:55 P.M.EHRLICHMAN:Hi.PRESIDENT:Well, I understand the weather was as good hereas it was in Florida.EHRLICHMAN:Beautiful.PRESIDENT:Great. (Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Just starting Spring up there. PRESIDENT:Oh, is it. Well, regardless of what the hellhappens during these rather difficult times, Camp David is always yours. For three years and eight months, huh.HALDEMAN:It couldn't be more beautiful than it was thisweekend.PRESIDENT:Yeah. (Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:All your tulips were out on the&#8211; PRESIDENT:They are? HALDEMAN:&#8211;bank down there by the pool, you know, and kidshad their Easter Egg hunt there and that wassensational.PRESIDENT:Right, right, right, right. HALDEMAN:(Tape noise). It was very nice. PRESIDENT:Right. PRESIDENT:Well, why don't we just, ah (unintelligible).(Tape noise). Apparently you have, you'vetalked to Connally about his view&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.2HALDEMAN:Yes, I have.PRESIDENT:and he's of the opinion and, uh, (tape noise)the facts.HALDEMAN:&#8211;he was, as he expressed to me, is not (tapenoise) (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:The problem, of course, is to get people toexpress their views (unintelligible). I don'twant to talk to Connally for a reason.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:I may, I may have to. EHRLICHMAN:Well, I talked to&#8211; PRESIDENT:I have a better reason that I frankly wouldn'twant to get his, get his (unintelligible) onthis God damn thing (unintelligible) the President this may indicate&#8211;HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:&#8211;one person not heard of they&#8482;ve taped. HALDEMAN:Well, I wish that I, I said, "I didn't want toraise it with him unless he wanted to talk aboutit&#8211;"PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:I said, "I want to talk with you about it on apersonal basis, not&#8211;&#64258;PRESIDENT:That's fair enough. HALDEMAN:&#64257;&#8211;not any other way."PRESIDENT:Fair enough.HALDEMAN:"&#8211;and I want to talk with you with the agreementbetween both of us that we haven't had the conversation, and uh, uh&#8211;"APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.3PRESIDENT:You see, I don't, I don't know that I could dothat.HALDEMAN:No, I think that's right and&#8211; PRESIDENT:But I'm glad you did, and that's fine. HALDEMAN:Well. Let me give you (unintelligible). PRESIDENT:But Rogers I can, I can talk to him and I did.Directly, quite directly. (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:A quick run through on what Connally says, ashe, as I'm sure Ron&#8482;s told you. This'll be&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:&#8211;be by some of what Ron has said. I think thatmay put it&#8211;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:He says: "I think the general situation seemsextremely bad, that little by little more and more becomes involved. Everyday there's something new. All the press talks about is this stuff now."PRESIDENT:There may not be&#8211;HALDEMAN:"It now implicates the President in many mindsand it must be brought to some resolution soon.&#64258; It appears to Connally as a reader of the newspapers, knowing nothing about the facts, that Mitchell is, is, undeniably involved, that Dean is probably equally involved, that Magruderis probably equally involved, and that Haldemanand Ehrlichman had more knowledge than anyone thought they had.PRESIDENT:Right.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.4HALDEMAN:Ah, he says: "You and John had better take agood look at your whole (unintelligible). Analyze how much you knew, and how much you're involved in the periphery, to the--even if you didn&#8482;t know."PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:He thinks my judgment and others familiar withthe case is better than any one else's. The question I've got to face is, am I guilty of knowing about something that if not illegal, was at least unethical. You've got to work on the basic assumption that whatever the facts are,they'll come out. Because everybody now is outto save his own skin. And a lot of people are out to nail other people.PRESIDENT:I think that's quite true. We got--everybody'sin business themselves.EHRLICHMAN:Sure. HALDEMAN:Most everybody, yeah.PRESIDENT:Including Colson.HALDEMAN:And then he says&#8211; PRESIDENT:Except for you two. (Laughter) HALDEMAN:Also, well, we've got a Nixon position too&#8211; PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:&#8211;uhh, he also says: "You've got to assume thateverything that comes out will be cast by thepress in the worst possible light.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Right. Right. HALDEMAN:"So, you've got to look at things from twostandpoints, the President's and yours.&#64258; He thinks that, uhh, the President should at leastconsider, aside from Ehrlichman and Haldeman,uh, looking at the whole thing,APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.5trying to make a new start, ending this somehowand making the point--He, he said: "It's clear that everybody who clearly is involved and knowingly is involved, must get out and get out now, and that specifically, he means, and by that he specifically means Dean.&#64258; He said:"The, President ought to look for other thingsto do as follows: like going to Congress and recommending a ten year term for the FBI Director (unintelligible) moving Kleindienst out of the Justice Department, and&#8211;"PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:"&#8211;giving them a new Attorney General&#8211;&#64258;PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:&#64257;&#8211;and meanwhile, then, "he said, "if you andJohn leave, I don't think the President realizes the problem he has in how he handles (unintelligible). (Tape. noise). "Uh, he said: &#64257;If it's inevitable that you're going to have toleave at some point in this, you should get outas soon as you can and prove your innocence. And, you should get out on the basis of your loyalty to the President.&#64258; Uh, he said, "I would not, by any means, discard the idea of taking a leave of absence. I had not originallythought of that as viable, but it might wellbe.&#64258; The thing that worries him, he says, "Is the money pay-off to the defense, "which he feels is at least as big as the bugging, right now, maybe bigger.PRESIDENT:Bigger?HALDEMAN:Yes. And he said, "What you have to do isconsider with your, with the President and with your lawyers, first of all, the wiretap area, secondly the money pay off, and both those you've got to look at first from the question of legal vulnerability and second the question ofmoral, ethics, publicity and PR vulnerability.&#64258;He said "That's where it appears to me your vulnerability comes. And that&#8211;"APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.6PRESIDENT:The second is the thing that I'm(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Right. Right. And he says, "That, in turndepends upon what people say, whether it's true or not. It does not depend on the facts."PRESIDENT:You mean, like, what, uhh Hunt says&#8211;HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:&#8211;what, uh, McCord says, what (unintelligible)Dean says&#8211;HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:&#8211;and what, and what LaRue says. HALDEMAN:That's right. And he said, "There's, there's aclear danger here. With all these peoplerattled that somebody's going to decide to lie some more. Just as obviously people have already lied. And to lie to try to do, it's conceivable, to lie to try to tie you into something you had no knowledge of. Somebody could come out, quietly come out and say, 'Ireported to Haldeman every evening on thewiretaps.'"PRESIDENT:Well. Now you can't prove it on that. On thatI would say it isn't--I think, what is more likely to land on the money side, perhaps on the face of the--that in view of the, the laterthings that happened, not at the time you werethere, but at the time in other words, the time the three, the three twenty-two went over and at the time that John uh, talked to Kalmbach at that time, uhh, certainly the humanitarian, uhh, they were employed at the Committee and soforth; I think makes a great deal of sense.The later time, the uhh, so-called La Costa conversation, and the troublesome conversation that, uhh, Dean had where he reported that Bittman had told, uhh, (tape noise).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). He makes the point, though,that that position depends on what people sayand whether you have a chance to answer&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.7HALDEMAN:&#8211;which you may or may not have. He said, "Yougotta face the fact the press (unintelligible) to destroy the President. (Unintelligible) One of the first things that will happen if you resign is that everyone will assume that you're more deeply involved than you are."PRESIDENT:Correct.HALDEMAN:For that reason, the legal essence becomes inhis mind a possibly more viable alternative. He says, "But, if you're ever directly involved by anybody in either the wiretapping or the papers, then your, you've got a problem. Whether it'strue or not.&#64258; Then, he says, "Under thecircumstances the President could say, "I'm convinced that Haldeman and Ehrlichman are not directly involved. "He said, "You've got to do a, do a very careful statement with the lawyers. (Unintelligible)."PRESIDENT:I, I, I have been indeed assured by--Anotherrather interesting thing from the legalstandpoint, John, is that the lawyers, uhh, they are writing me a memorandum to the effect&#8211;HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:&#8211;we have studied all this and they are notinvolved, and I said, "I have this from theirlawyers, da da da da." Not bad. It's a, it's apretty good option. I mean, I think that's something we should consider in any event.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:&#8211;that&#8211;you could say that, and then say, "Butnotwithstanding their innocence as this isstated, they have asked for, for a leave of absence until this is cleared up. And I've granted it."PRESIDENT:There must be no&#8211;(unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Well&#8211;PRESIDENT:&#8211;as John, you see, indicated to, uhh, in earlierconversation, that he didn't go to sleep (unintelligible).APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.8HALDEMAN:He said that to me, too, he said he had notfiled a leave of absence (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) flat out. (Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:He said that. (Unintelligible). Then he, thenhe, got back to him, and he said, "The other thing to do, you should not rule this out, is todo nothing, in other words." And he said, "Theproblem with that, that&#8482;s the strongest position to take and basically the best position, but it&#8482;s also the highest risk, because, if you do that, and then somebody successfully lays anything at your door, you will have destroyedthe President.&#64258; That is the problem he feelswith that area. Now, he says, "If you know they can't successfully lay anything at your door, then that's clearly .the route to take."PRESIDENT:Now, on successfully at your door, did he saythere that he approached both areas, both legal and, uhh, inference, uhh&#8211;HALDEMAN: Yes.PRESIDENT:You see what I mean&#8211; HALDEMAN: Yes. PRESIDENT:&#8211;as far as laying something successfully at yourdoor, that's been done in your case already, and John's maybe in the future.HALDEMAN:Not really. I mean he does&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well, then I--not legally, but the inference,the inference thing, I, what I, what I&#8211;HALDEMAN:Okay. He says he "has a lingering fear aboutthe stories of the feud between Ehrlichman and Mitchell and that they've sworn vengeance oneach other, or something," because he said they&#8211;PRESIDENT:What about that? Is it. I would agree there'ssome truth in it. Not on your part, but Mitchell's.EHRLICHMAN:Not on mine, I know&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.9PRESIDENT:But you remember Mitchell, John, in the Alsopcase&#8211;it is (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Alsop printed a sort of a "tattler tale" theother day. What happened, and I mentioned this to you at the time, Mitchell got drunk at a party and fell on me in the presence of KayGraham and Alsop (unintelligible)&#8211;PRESIDENT:When, when, when? EHRLICHMAN:well, this was when he was Attorney General. PRESIDENT:Oh. EHRLICHMAN:And uh, came down on me very hard at that time. PRESIDENT:0h. (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:He was too liberalEHRLICHMAN:I was too liberal and I was misadvising you andI had to get out of the White House and on and on and on.HALDEMAN:This is typical John talk. EHRLICHMAN:Uhh, Alsop never forgot that. PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And so&#8211;PRESIDENT:Also, I remember, too, with regard, John, uhh,in that connection something Bob told me. Remember, Bob you said you talked to Mitchell about what we should do about (unintelligible) and he said, "Haldeman, "uh, no, I mean,"Ehrlichman and Colson must go."HALDEMAN: Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Well, then Alsop put together the fact that Iwas the one who talked to Mitchell down here a week ago Saturday&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.10PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and that the whole conversation and he made astory on that.PRESIDENT:Sure. Okay, but go ahead on that, that's,that's a side issue.HALDEMAN:Okay, his point there is, though, he saysMitchell's already lied, and you don't know whathe'll do next, and that worry-- he sees that as a late (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:We all, we all agree with that is that Mitchellis, Mitchell has lied once.EHRLICHMAN:At least.(Laughter)HALDEMAN:There's, there's no way of disagreeing with thatbecause he's told conflicting stories so one of them has to be a lie. He said he wasn't at a meeting, he said he was at a meeting, both of them under oath&#8211;PRESIDENT:Oh?HALDEMAN:&#8211;or at least we're told that.PRESIDENT:Yeah. (Tape noise). (Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). That's, that's a curiousthing. Nobody seems to get very upset about it.EHRLICHMAN:Is Petersen telling you anything aboutMitchell's problems in New York with that GrandJury?PRESIDENT:Not yet. EHRLICHMAN:I understand they're very close to indicting himfor perjury.HALDEMAN:John says tomorrow. As we go over this, uh, youshould operate on the basic approach that firstyou have to go back to the fundamental issues:the legal issue that you're involved legally, get out now; on the moral PR issue, you've got to assume that they probably can nail you on something&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.11PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:&#8211;in some way, but you don't know that. You'vegot to assume that if you are accused, people will believe the accusation, the tendency will be to believe it&#8211;.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:&#8211;this question's (unintelligible)&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:&#8211;and you've got to, you've got to go on thebasis that whatever the facts are, they'll come out, that you've got to be prepared for the possible deliberate charge against an innocentperson even if it's a lie.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:You've got to be prepared that anyone whotouched the money or knew the purposes of the money were to buy off witnesses&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:To defend. HALDEMAN:&#8211;obstruct justice, will be, will be guilty inthe public mind, and that the worst possiblepicture will be painted of anybody and everybody. "Now", he says, "if you move out, if you resign, two assumptions will immediately be made by the public, and these will be total in your view. One, you're guilty, and two, thePresident knew about it.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Sure. HALDEMAN:"So, that will not, that act will not relieve,the President of any immediate problem that he now has."PRESIDENT:Absolutely right.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.12HALDEMAN:The only possible thing it does is preclude thepossibility of adding to that problem, as new revelations come out if you know that they are going to come out. He says, "It won't hurt you in the long haul to resign because ultimately the truth will, be known, and either you are inor you are out and whatever that is will beknown, whether you, whether you're in the White House or whether you're not.&#64258; But, on the short term basis, is, there's an enormous increase in vulnerability for you if I get out, especially against the deliberate lying.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:"So, then,&#64258; he says, "so it gets back to whatcan Mitchell or Dean put on you?&#64258; He said, "One thing I you better remember, you could ride out PR vulnerabilities, but you cannot ride out legal culpability because legal culpability you have."PRESIDENT:Now, by that, he means, uhh, any kind of anindictment (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Well, not indictment--indictment that isn't on avalid charge, that is, where I have to plead guilty, or, or, where I wouldn't be able to successfully defend myself.EHRLICHMAN:Right.HALDEMAN:Uhh, he says, "You, you've got to make somedecisions. And I appreciate the President's feeling that you should. And you ought to decide now what to do. You ought to stick with it and not go back and relook at it unless thefacts materially change and then you ought to,you have to relook at it.&#64258; He said, "The President has told me that he is convinced that you've done nothing illegal. I have to say, Bob,&#64258; he said, "that it is my feeling that if that is what the President believes, then he hasthe duty to stand by you. Then," he said,"don't resign just because you thinkAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.13that solves the problem, because At, doesn't.It aggrevates the problem. Once you're out, the enemies, both the press the political, have a wide open shot at the President, and they have a wide open shot at you, especially the people who want to lie.&#64258; He said, "The fundamental questionis whether the President survives in a viablefashion.&#64258; Then, that brought him back and he says, "I don&#8482;t know, maybe you shouldn't even take leave. You've just got to go on the best guess as to what all the people involved here are going to do.&#64258; He said, "If you're innocentand clearly innocent, then don't move a penny.But face the fact that they can still make you look bad even though you are innocent. Then, comes back to the basic question of fundamental innocence. You've got to look at this on the legal basis, the PR basis, your personal jeopardy, and the President's position. You'vegot to analyze all those factors.&#64258; He says, "Ihave to believe that if a man is innocent, he should stand his ground. He should not move. But the problem of advising on this is that I don't know the facts, so I have to deal with the law of probabilities.&#64258; He said, "The worstproblem is you don't know the facts, so you haveto deal with the law of probability."PRESIDENT:We may know the facts. Uhh, but we don't knowwhat's gonna come out.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) All right, let me say we have apretty good&#8211;HALDEMAN:Well I think we've got--if we know the facts Ithink we ought&#8482;a assume they'll come out.PRESIDENT:&#8211;that's my point, go on. HALDEMAN:"So, then, "he says, "go back to thefundamentals. Get your lawyer's advice.&#64258; Then he goes through (unintelligible) all people whowill decide the right thing (unintelligible).&#64258;Then he said, "That my final advice to you is, "he said, Nellie&#8482;s just come in and she's sitting here on the bed and she says to give you her love and to tell you that she's standing by you&#8211;"APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.14PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:&#8211;and she doesn't believe any of this"&#8211;and hesaid, "Don't ever take, a needless risk. (Tape noise) make any move unless you know it has to be made. It's not enough to say that you can obviate your association with the President PRwise by taking a leave or, for, by resigning.No matter what you do, the President will be affected.&#64258;PRESIDENT:No question. HALDEMAN:"And your moving out will definitely be anadverse move to both you and he President in theshort run. So, that you've got to weigh is, isthat adversity worth whatever you gain by it.&#64258; Now, that's quite a bit different because he spelled it out in a lot more detail.PRESIDENT:That he's thought it through more. HALDEMAN:Than where it came out with Ron and&#8211; PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) You know usually,(unintelligible), Kelly that it comes out andsays (unintelligible) well, thinks about it, says well maybe you've got to think it through.EHRLICHMAN:Pardon? (Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Now, I sure don't want to fault Ron on hisevery&#8211;PRESIDENT:No, no, no. Ron reported to me exactly whathe'd said.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). And&#8211; PRESIDENT:And (Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) says to me I think he, I thinkthat's, that's what is what he said.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.15HALDEMAN:What Rogers s aid to me was, he said, "Bob, Ican't decide this because I don't know the facts, and I keep saying every time Ron calls me and I even said it to the President when I talked to him, that he's got to decide.&#64258; He said, &#64257;I believe that your case is going to beespecially tough, and there is a problem of howyou can do your job with this stuff hanging there&#8211;"PRESIDENT:That's the point he later&#8211; HALDEMAN:&#8211;and he said, "The way I lean upon this is thatyou should take a leave of absence until itscleared up."PRESIDENT:Well, did he get leave of absence? HALDEMAN:Yes, sir, he raised it. That's why I raised itwith Connally.PRESIDENT:See he was the leave of absence man,(unintelligible) basically the (unintelligible) opinion of Connally was the two best judgmentswe've got here. (Tape noise) leave of absencething on the basis of fairness (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Rogers then said, he said, "I don't knowanything about John, and I just (unintelligible)," but he said, "I keep, on all of this, I keep coming back to where I was, andI'd called him saying I wanted to talk to him,and he said he didn't want to talk with me.&#64258; (Unintelligible). He said I did--he "was concerned about his position."PRESIDENT:Yes. HALDEMAN:He said, "I can't be in the position of being anarbitor between you and the President.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Oh, yeah, yeah. HALDEMAN:"I'm not asking that, Bill, I'm asking about,all I had in mind was asking your advice. Because I'm concerned that the decision is being made, that, made, being made on the wrong basisor for the wrong reasons."PRESIDENT:Right.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.16HALDEMAN:"If that's the case, I want to be sure that allthe opposing views&#8211;"PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:&#64257;&#8211;to that decision, regardless of wh--how theyaffect me, are, are weighed and I, I see you, Rogers, as being&#8211;PRESIDENT:Sure.HALDEMAN:&#64257;&#8211;the most likely guy to make that possible,because nobody else can talk to the President about this."PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:"&#8211;and the President is in one helluva positionbecause normally in these things&#8211;"PRESIDENT:I have somebody I can talk to, you'd do it orJohn would.HALDEMAN:&#64257;&#8211;(unintelligible) involved in it. John was anadvocate in in some areas, that, that, I never was really, like on foreign policy things or anything else."PRESIDENT:Sure.HALDEMAN:You had somebody here who could argue theopposite of whatever was coming up. Bill said, "I must not be in the position of making a decision. (Unintelligible) asking you that.&#64258; He said, "Talk to the President, he wants totalk to you&#8211;"PRESIDENT:Good. HALDEMAN:&#8211;and he said, "Its important that you talk itthrough with him. (Unintelligible) basis.&#64258; Then he said, "If after you've talked with the President, you still feel that, that theapproach is wrong or that the understanding'swrong or anything else from the standpoint of the Presidency, then I'd be happy to talk with you about it and hear what your problem is (unintelligible) (tape noise)&#8211;"APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.17PRESIDENT:Sure.HALDEMAN:&#8211;come out with. PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN: Uh&#8211; PRESIDENT:They're both right--being good lawyers insaying, "Look, we can't make a judgment on itwithout all the facts.&#64258;HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) the facts. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) the basis (unintelligible). HALDEMAN:I think it is, because&#8211; PRESIDENT:We've got, we've got, we've got to look at, whatI'd like to do basically, is to look at thefacts which I discussed, of course, with thelawyers, the legal matter, first. (Tape noise). The facts on the (tape noise) question of let us suppose, let us suppose (unintelligible) (tape noises), the Grand Jury (tape noise) let me, let me get through here just a minute, say one or two things that cannot wait. The lawyerswith me again lean on Petersen, direct him toget this goddamn thing, uh, closed up. And, uh, Dick said, "I will.&#64258; I said uh, "Can I tell Petersen with regard to Bob and John making (unintelligible) they've been wanting their, their counsel to, they've been wanting to (tapenoise) their story to the prosecution, youknow&#8211;and to the Grand Jury."HALDEMAN:They did that last week. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Not really. They said, "We're ready any time."But the point is they left it with the fact thatthey, that they would be in touch with them,they, they did it a little different, they--What they're really getting at, Bob, is to take a more affirmative stance on that, in other words (unintelligible) publically.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.18HALDEMAN:They hit us on this yesterday&#8211;PRESIDENT:Publicly. HALDEMAN:&#8211;and we said, "Wait." PRESIDENT:Okay. HALDEMAN(Unintelligible) our lawyers did it.(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yeah, well, no problem. I'm " not suggesting,uhh, after kicked it around. You see 'cause they were trying to (unintelligible) it's really not fair to have lawyers, uhh, trying to pick up a PR problem here. But they kicked it around. I, said well if you wrote a letter to this sort,it should be let it out. I said, "We have noobjection (unintelligible) PR.&#64258; I said, "Now, the other thing is, with regard to Bob and John, if, if, you're not, if, if you take if you take a leave of absence for coming out either way, it is necessary to do something, uhh, most, most everybody agrees with that." By something--Imean by that, uhh, (tape noise) for your sakesandperhaps, uhh, also for the Presidency, let me say in terms of, of uh, your sakes first because (tape noise) being a wild crescendo of leaks, and, and explorative statements, and so forth, just beating the shit out of you(unintelligible) without your taking a strongaffirmative position that, "By God, we want to be heard, we want to be cleared, and we're innocent. "In other words, I just think it has to be said. Also, from the standpoint of the President, the President's got to be in' aposition that he has talked to his(unintelligible) and they want to be heard, they want to be, as early as possible, they want to be cleared, and so forth, and so on. Now, (tape noise) but anyway, we'll talk about that defensive tactic, uhh, the, which I think wouldcome into play, uhh, in fact, in any event, butwhatever they do, whatever they do, do that, whatever you do you cannot just sit and wait, you and John, and the Grand Jury finally goes its deadly process, leaks come out of there, and the whole damn thing appears in Anderson's column and then in addition to that every son-of-a-bitch puts out statements to the effectthat, likeAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M.

Let&#8482;s, let's come down to (tape noise) solutions therefore. However (tape noise) more incentive (unintelligible). Do you favor it?EHRLICHMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:That's the problem.

(Unintelligible) And third, (unintelligible) you ask him to put down for me, which I don't know whether he cando this (unintelligible) or not, but I ask him (unintelligible) got information (unintelligible). Well, he's already, I said, based on what you have today, (unintelligible) what is your case, potentially, against these men?EHRLICHMAN:Likewise, I would think he&#8482;d want it against Dean, uh, to know whether there's an indictment upcoming or what the&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well, that&#8482;s right. (Tape noise) talk about theDean problem. The Dean problem is a goddamn tough one (unintelligible) because, uh, I heardby this conversation, uh, (unintelligible) (tapenoise) threatens (unintelligible) (tape noise)APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.25PRESIDENT:(cont.)Counsel which is not granted with thatunderstanding (tape noise) (unintelligible) (tape noise) the President gets caught in obstruction of justice.

He&#8482;s, probably (unintelligible) tryingto keep Petersen, from (tape noise).EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) reported to him(unintelligible) round about, about your phone call from Camp David. (Tape noise)PRESIDENT:Immunity?EHRLICHMAN:No. About not getting into national securitystuff.PRESIDENT:(Tape noise) I'll ask him. EHRLICHMAN:Could have been very direct. In other words, ifyou order Petersen not to take that (unintelligible) he may have started to give it (unintelligible) and Petersen said, "I've beenordered not to give that information&#8211;"PRESIDENT:Not on national security, no. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;he may be&#8211; PRESIDENT:Is that obstruction of justice? EHRLICHMAN:No. but, what Dean is, what Dean is obviouslydoing here (unintelligible) a, he's, he's tryingto construct a big dam cluttered by, in myopinion. I think he, he's being very, uh&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well, I told Dean, too, I said, I said, "Now,John, anything with me is privileged, and anything with national security is privileged." I okayed on that.EHRLICHMAN:Let&#8482;s--I think that's really sort of an openquestion in all this&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.26EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and if I can say go back and forth and on andso on, but (unintelligible) in thinking about this, I keep coming back to Dean because there are things that don't add up otherwise&#8211;PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;in this whole thing.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And, I don't know if you feel you can do this,but I think the three of us know one another well enough, that, we've been through enough together, but (unintelligible) (tape noise) necessary that we have your very candid&#8211;PRESIDENT:Assessment?EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;assessment of the threat to you. Obviously,neither one of us want to do anything to harm you in any way, we want to avoid harming you.PRESIDENT:The threat (to me because of) Dean?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. PRESIDENT:All right.EHRLICHMAN:Now, let me, let me just spin something out foryou. As a, as a&#8211;PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;it has a probably a far out point, as we workback&#8211;PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;I think it's entirely conceivable that if Deanis totally out of control and if matters are not handled adroitly that you could get a resolution of impeachment&#8211;PRESIDENT:That's right.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.27EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;in the Senate&#8211;PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s right. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;I don't know if you've thought of this or not,but I got thinking about it last night. Uh, on the ground that you committed a crime.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, and that there is no other legal processavailable to, uh, uh, the United States people, other than&#8211;PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;other than impeachment. Otherwise, you haveimmunity from prosecution.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, so I think we have to, I think we have tothink about that. We have to (unintelligible)&#8211;PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and see about, see what the point is, is it acrime, if any, and uh, how serious it is, and would Dean, is a threat, and what we do aboutit. Uh, my own analysis is that what he hasfalls far short of any commission of a crime by you. So far as know.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:I don't know what you may have talked about withhim in those ten or twelve hours you and hespent there in the months, months of Februaryand March.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Uh, but, uh, you get down to a point whereyou've got John Dean prancing in there and saying, "The President said this and thePresident said that," and having somebody inyour behalf come back and say, "No, the President didn't say that, andAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.28EHRLICHMAN:that's ridiculous.&#64258; Uh, and., and., so you get(cont.)a kind of credibility thing unless., like heseems to be doing., he's very busy, uh, dredging up corroborating evidence and looking for documentation or taking statements from people based on leads that may have developed fromthose conversations. And I think really theonly way that I know to make a judgement on this is for you to listen to your tapes and see what actually was said then, or maybe for Bob to do it, or, or, somebody. See what was said there. And then analyze how big a threat that is.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:If it didn't come out of those meetings, then Ithink it's imaginary.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Because it then does not come out of your mouth,it comes by reason of the actions of, or something that one of us said or did, and it canbe handled. But if you're really confronted withthat kind of a dilemna, or that kind of crisis in this thing, uh, I think before any other steps are taken, any precipitous steps (unintelligible) on us for that matter, uh, you better damn sure know&#8211;PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;what your hole card is&#8211; PRESIDENT:I agree. EHRLICHMAN:Uh, beyond that, uh, hell, I'm, I'm not afraidof Dean, uh, and what he might say about me for instance. Uh, I think it can be handled. Uh,I don&#8482;t think Bob has anything to fear fromDean, basically, then, particularly based on what the attorneys tell us, uh, he has an almost unlimited capacity to dredge up, uh, anecdotes, uh, from a from a dim and murky past, and we&#8482;re just gonna have, have to handle it one by one.You mentioned the La Costa plan. Our fellowsAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.29EHRLICHMAN:probably didn't tell you this but Dick Moore&#8482;s(cont.)attorney called on him, uh, on John Wilson, andindicated that Dick Moore just doesn't have any memory at all about La Costa. He can barely remember even being out there.PRESIDENT:Dick, Dick Moore told me&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:I understand.PRESIDENT:&#8211;he said there was something&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:I understand. PRESIDENT:&#8211;maybe his memory's become dim. EHRLICHMAN:His memory is, apparently, feeble beyondmeasure, because his attorney has explained tohim what his exposure is&#8211;PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and Dick is scared shitless, apparently. Uh&#8211; PRESIDENT:To what point? HALDEMAN:&#8211;To the point where he has contacted Silbert to ascertain that he will not be indicted prior to his daughter's wedding, so that he can go tohis daughter's wedding.HALDEMAN:Now, that was his proposal to his attorney to dothat.PRESIDENT:Okay. HALDEMAN:He wanted his attorney to, to go and find out. PRESIDENT:Is Dick thinking he's going to be indicted?HALDEMAN:Yeah, yeah.EHRLICHMAN:But not for&#8211; HALDEMAN:But not for, not for that conversation&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.30EHRLICHMAN:Dick, Dick has been--he can tell, with Dean, allthrough this process. And far more than either of us, far more.PRESIDENT:Well, let me suggest this, Bob, uh, you've gotthe conversation (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Now, let me say&#8211; HALDEMAN:Yeah, PRESIDENT:&#8211;(unintelligible) I think I remember, I wouldremember everything, except, you see, there'salways a possibility that Dean may havediscussed this case with (unintelligible). I know the Bittman conversation, you know&#8211;HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:&#8211;I know however, that in that conversation, thequestion was raised of blackmail--I know, however, that in that conver-, I also raised thequestion how much is it going to, would it cost&#8211;HALDEMAN:Yeah. (Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:&#8211;a million dollars. And I said facetiously,"Well, I guess we can get a million dollars.&#64258; It was then that we started my whole investigation. Now, I don't know, how does thatone sound to you?EHRLICHMAN:Well, that sound tough and&#8211; PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;uh, yet it's manageable. (Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Yeah. Point out that that was triggered.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.31EHRLICHMAN:If we know, obviously, knowledge is,&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;is terribly important here. PRESIDENT:Absolutely. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and., uh, this guy is using this to lever youhowever, he is using this or he's usingsomething else, I don't know what the somethingelse would be. He certainly can't use the Hunt escapade on the coast because that was totally outside of your knowledge, and it doesn't reach you. Uh&#8211;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Oh, well, yeah, but that isn't our problem hereas I see it.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:He's got to have a lever that works on you&#8211; PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and, uh, so it's got to involve your personalcognizance in this thing, uh, so&#8211;PRESIDENT:I asked Petersen whether, uh, I talked to Dean,and Dean said before he pled, he would like to talk to (unintelligible) and Petersen said no, so I'll find out from Petersen what Dean's story is.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think Dean is&#8211;HALDEMAN:Did Dean go to the Grand Jury today?PRESIDENT:I don't know. No, not yet. They haven't made adeal yet.EHRLICHMAN:Is he, is he thinking of making a deal, Silbertand Dean?PRESIDENT:I guess. Well, a deal, no; his, his attorneysare still at arms length on Dean testifying, touse his terms.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.32EHRLICHMAN:All, all I'm saying is that, that before you,before you decide, I think we have to look at the ultimate problem here&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and I must say that that may not totallyresolve the ultimate problem. I'm trying tothink of where your problems are in this. Idon't think we can brush them off by just saying, that, that the problems of being able to govern, or the problems of&#8211;PRESIDENT:No. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;the press (unintelligible), and so on, or anyof that kind. I think there's a whole newproblem here&#8211;PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and there're going to be a lot of&#8211; PRESIDENT:Whether I was involved in obstruction ofjustice.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;or in the bugging, or in, you know, any ofthese episodes and there're going to be ahundred and fifty-eight reporters in this town digging away at the individuals involved in this case&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;for the next year, next two years, trying toget some guy to crack.PRESIDENT:So, we get, so we get, get them, so we get atleast the situation, uh, as far as we know, uh, uh, La Costa I heard about you remember, you didn't talk to me about it (unintelliglble) Bob, let&#8482;s listen to these conversations, andwhat the hell Dean, Dean could have discussedthat. I don't remember specifically, you know, but, he could have discussed the fact. Well, we've got the problem, when he made his, what he calls his "cancer on the heart of the Presidency speech,&#64258; which he may, which was more(unintelligible). HeAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.33PRESIDENT:could have discussed there the problem of these,(cont.)of, of, uh, defendants, and, you know what Imean?HALDEMAN:Yeah (unintelligible). PRESIDENT:But the payoff, uh, uh, and whether I saidanything which would of led him to believe thathe should pay them off&#8211;HALDEMAN:Let's&#8211; PRESIDENT:&#8211;I don't think so. HALDEMAN:&#8211;Let's not worry about it. It's either, it'seither there or it isn't&#8211;PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:&#8211;but, let's see what's there&#8211;PRESIDENT:And if it is?&#8211; HALDEMAN:&#8211;let's listen to it&#8211; PRESIDENT:&#8211;if it is? Then we have to play in terms of Iwas having to find out what is implication was.EHRLICHMAN:I think then it becomes very important how youcouch your decision on being&#8211;PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and you can, you can go one of several waysdepending on what the, what the problem is, and you can (unintelligible). You can pre-empt this pretty much, I think, by the way you do it, but uh, that's, that's really a separate subjectfrom what happens here, and, uh, uh, seems tome&#8211;PRESIDENT:Did he come up and talk to you about the Bittmanconversation?EHRLICHMAN:Yes.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.34PRESIDENT:How did he present it to you? After he talkedto me?EHRLICHMAN:No, I don't think so. I think this was beforehe talked to you, but I'm not sure.HALDEMAN:You don't know because, we don't, we can'tstill, I still can't fix when he talked to youon it.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:(Tape noise) He talked to me around thetwentieth.PRESIDENT:Then, Bob, after we talked, you don't think youwere in the room now do you when he talked tome?HALDEMAN:Yeah, I remember the conversation. PRESIDENT:You do? HALDEMAN:Yeah, but I think it was, see, I keep--Iremember&#8211;PRESIDENT:Is memory about like I stated? HALDEMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:Did we say, "Let's go out and get the money"?HALDEMAN:Yeah, I don't remember the specifics, I justremember the&#8211;PRESIDENT:Was there any--do you remember my saying, "Look,we've got to get the money, can't you find somebody to get the money?"HALDEMAN:You didn't--I don't remember your saying, "We'vegot to get it. I remember you saying, "Can't some--we ought to be able to raise that kind of money, or&#8211;"PRESIDENT:"A million dollars." HALDEMAN:"&#8211;there ought to be that kind of moneyavailable.&#64258;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.35PRESIDENT:"Yeah, a million dollars."HALDEMAN:(unintelligible) something like that, yeah. PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s right. EHRLICHMAN:But you didn't say to do it, or that you would,or anything like that. Other than that, I don't recall, but I can't fix going through the logsand everthing. I can't fix when thatconversation was, this, this&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well, you've got to find out, got to find out.And then if we find that to be the case, if there's anything that I said at that point, I mean, you can understand, John, I could havetalked with him about it, we were talking(unintelligible) whole goddamn thing, of course. We talked about it (unintelligible). My point is that if we find that out, if we have to couch, we have to remember what our, what the line is and the line has got to be, "I was conducting an investigation and finding outwhat, where this thing went."EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'm sure that's the case because thetiming has to be in the frame of March 19, 20, 21.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Uh, let me&#8211;HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) the investigation.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;let me answer your question about myconversation with&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;he came, first of all (unintelligible) hisversion of the conversation, as I understand it,is that, and we have this pegged pretty wellbecause of the conversations I've had and worked this back. (Clears throat). His conversation with me was, he came and told me about, uh, Bittman making this demand on behalf of Hunt,APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.36EHRLICHMAN:and I simply referred him back to Mitchell. Now, that's not quite accurate, uh, I can, I can&#8211;PRESIDENT:You say that is what he has said? EHRLICHMAN:That's what he has said. PRESIDENT:How do you know?EHRLICHMAN:Well, because he told Bob this, in a longconversation which would--is in effect his bill of particulars&#8211;PRESIDENT:But when did he&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;It's rather interesting. I have a very, Ididn't realize I had it, I have quite avoluminous set of notes that Dean reports to meon things in general in this investigation period when he was up at Camp David, obviously spinning out his web&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and he tried out bits and pieces, that, notbits and pieces, he tried (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Did he bring me into the conversation aboutBittman? He did not.EHRLICHMAN:No. PRESIDENT:Did he bring me in the conversation about(unintelligible)?EHRLICHMAN:No.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:And in point of fact, I'm sure, unless I'mdreaming, that he said (unintelligible) or something. In point of fact, what, what did happen was that he and I had a conversation and I raised the point of this being an endless setof demands&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.37EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and said that for my part, I would rather testthe privilege on national security, which I knew was involved&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. Oh, that reminds me of one thing. Deansaid that&#8211;REEL 2 BEGINSAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.38REEL TWO BEGINSPRESIDENT:The, uh, basically, the Bittman thing. Was--hesaid that was blackmail. He said no, that wasnot blackmailing the Presidency that would blackmail Ehrlichman.EHRLICHMAN:Um hum. Um hum. And that's the way hepresented to me, in fact, ya know, there's a point here that's never been raised in all the discoveries, this triggers, that triggers mymemory on it. (unintelligible) Dean atone&#8211;REEL ONE ENDS &#8211;point was very intrigued with using blackmailas a defense.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:On the whole cover-up operation.PRESIDENT:He told me that. Early on. EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) that, that was the thing--wecould develop a case, that it was, that, that was a legal defense. That we weren't, we weren't obstructing justice. We were victims ofblackmail.PRESIDENT:But you hav--, you have&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:It never made any sense, it's not a(unintelligible) spelling out, spinning out&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well. EHRLICHMAN:What I, what I did uh, as soon as he presentedthis to me was to check my files and counterprobe the conflict that he got, to see what the--to refresh my recollections so when--the whole chain of circumstances had been, I became convinced in that review that the matter was not as serious as I had sorta carried around in my thought that it was in terms of culpability.But more than that, that it was a legitimateAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.39EHRLICHMAN:national security subject and that we are tostonewall it, but there was no sense in starting to buckle in to this kind of a demand. So that was my second response to Dean. He then apparently went back to Mitchell and we have only (unintelligible) a kind of glancing, uh,reference to it in Mitchell, Dean, Haldeman,Ehrlichman meeting of the following day, which would have been about the twenty-second or third, where Dean says to John, something like, uh, what's the status of that matter or John raised it with him and they went back and fort,and Mitchell finally said "Well, I think it'staken care of.&#64258; Now that&#8211;PRESIDENT:Dean raised it? EHRLICHMAN:Well, Dean or Mitchell raised it in that case. HALDEMAN:I have. I may be wrong. But maybe I've justconvinced myself that&#8211;PRESIDENT:Mitchell&#8211;HALDEMAN:I have a very strong recollection on that, thatit was in a weak reference, about the middle-- there was a lull in the discussion and Mitchell turned to Dean, said what have you done about the, the Hunt matter or about that problem we had yesterday or some&#352;I&#8482;m not sure how he hadidentified it. He said, "What have you doneabout the problem.&#64258; I was fascinated with this because I was watching the son-of-a-bitch at work, and trying to figure out, what the hell he was doing himself. So what have you done about that problem? Dean looked a little confused andsaid, "Well, uh, uh, nothing." And, uh, Mitchellsaid, "Well, I think, I guess it's o-, I guess it's taken care of" And it was that fast. I mean, it was&#8211;PRESIDENT:You reported that to me. HALDEMAN:Like a total of about three or four sentences.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.40PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Out of, uh, uh, a three or four hour meeting,uh,&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:And I have a strong feeling that&#8482;s all that wasdone there.PRESIDENT:Well, look. It's very important that you goback and just--that you, uh, get the, the tapes of everything we had with Dean and see what the hell, uh, has been discussed. I can assure you that, uh, we may have covered a large part of some of those things, because basically, uh, heraised lots of questions and that I think&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:About Watergate? PRESIDENT:I have no recollection, John, of ever hearing,no recollection of, except the obstruction of justice thing he raised. I said what is the obstruction of justice--have we run into the legal s--, uh, uh, I said, is It obstruction ofjustice to help the defendants? No. Uh, ifthat's the purpose. But it is obstruction of justice, it's to keep them quiet. And I said, well the question is the end. We went into that (unintelligible) and so forth and so on.EHRLICHMAN:How, uh, uh, to just, to just tie this down. Boband I have been, of course, rigorously goingthrough every scrap of paper we have, trying to reconstruct. I am, I am forcibly struck with the realization that I began to understand this case, what Dean's involvement was and what Mitchell and Magruder's involvement was, only inthe month of March, this year. And that, thisall began surfacing about the time that Dean realized that he had his (unintelligible) and began constructing his theory of the case and then began unloading them on us, item by item and bit by bit&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.41HALDEMAN:Brainwashing us.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. I mean, over and over he'd work you over,every time he&#8482;d get you, he'd work on a line like, uh, I knew that he had told me after the meeting that we'd--they'd cancelled the intelligence operations. He musta told me thatthirty times.PRESIDENT:He said what? Dean. EHRLICHMAN:That, that he had, he, that he had reported tome after the second meeting with Mitchell and all, that, that they had gone through a, another shot at a, a, ridiculous intelligence operation.That&#8211;PRESIDENT:&#8211;that he informed you. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;that he and Mitchell had turned it down. Andthat he felt that there was no profit, profit in pursuing that any further and that held like to, uh, pull out of it completely and didn't I agree, and he says I agree, and he had nofurther contact with any intelligence planningfrom then on. Now, I suspect that Mitchell says and some of the other evidence says, that he was in the third meeting. That he may have been involved in another meeting after that. He was using all this (unintelligible) to try and getme as a corroborating witness that he wasn't.Now, so now I don't know what I, what I believe.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Okay. Let me suggest this, that, uh,before I meet with Petersen, I want you to listen to those things.EHRLICHMAN:I can't do it. It's twelve hours of tapes. I.may be able to focus in on it, uh,(unintelligible) Bittman.PRESIDENT:Right. (Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. I can, I think I can&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.42PRESIDENT:Well, I, I'd like to get it all. Well,&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think I know which meeting it was. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah. Can you do that? Uh,&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:I think I can get, I think I can zero in on thatone. If I miss, I can work out from that two ways and come up with a pretty fast(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Tape noise) That&#8482;s what his really saying, to,uh, Higby wasn't it?EHRLICHMAN:I assume so. I, that's the only thing I canthink (unintelligible). It's a danger of assuming that. (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:The thing that impressed Higby most out of thatconversation was that Dean was totally cold, totally, uh, not much different from the old John Dean. And he said, "Larry, I have nothing to fear here I fear no man in this world." (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Tape noise) every man involved.EHRLICHMAN:Larry said afterward he acted as if he were in(unintelligible). Dean is terribly afraid, uh, and this&#8482;s come up two or three times. He's terribly afraid of his inability to carry off the lie. He's afraid that&#8211;PRESIDENT:Slight hand shake.EHRLICHMAN:Yes, he told me that earlier, that&#8211; HALDEMAN:There this question that popped up with Mitchelland Dean. (Tape noise) Goddamn. You know, it's something, uh, they're gonna take into their minds, somehow, the assumption that Dean may belying and try to break him too. (Tape noise)use Dean as a witness under the (unintelligible) they also got to look at Dean as a principal.PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.43EHRLICHMAN:(Tape noise) Part of the reason, uh, we gottaget down there and talk to this U.S. Attorney&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. How do you face this? We&#8482;re quite cold.You're not--what Dean can say about you, it would be your word against Dean, where they&#8482;re concerned is (tape noise) Dean saying somethingabout the President. Opportunity(unintelligible) to damn President Nixon. Damn cold on that point. (Unintelligible-tape noise) we can all be, uh, (unintelligible), Mr. President, and all that sort of thing. Obstruction. I don't know (unintelligible).Uh, you bartering for trouble and probably notwith Dean. You have an individual here who's out to do various things&#8211;HALDEMAN:You've got the other side of it though. If itcomes down to Dean versus the President. Dean won't be believed either.PRESIDENT:Well&#8211;HALDEMAN:And&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well&#8211; HALDEMAN:And well,&#8211; PRESIDENT:That's a terrible charge though. HALDEMAN:It&#8211; PRESIDENT:You don't know what he has (unintelligible).But, if you think (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Yes, sir. PRESIDENT:And, uh, I'll ask him where the(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Yes, sir. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.44PRESIDENT:If we could leave that for a moment&#8211;HALDEMAN:Let&#8482;s just stay with it for a second. PRESIDENT:Or--well, I mean, let me say--yeah, I&#8482;m gonnastay with it, but I, but I made the point. The point that I 'm also making though is that before I meet with Petersen tonight, I want toknow what the damn tapes are. Now, the earliertapes, I am sure dealt almost exclusively with, with executive privilege or that sort of thing.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah,&#8211; PRESIDENT:&#8211;(Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:&#8211;but, your meeting with Dean and Moore was onthe subject of how to deal with the ErvinCommittee that time.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:That's how, it all started. At, at least theway&#8211;PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:&#8211;what, what Dean (unintelligible)&#8211;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) hurt and all that sort of stuffand so forth and so on. But, at a later point you see, Dean may have decided in his own mind, well I got to get the President involved and that's probably why he told me about it.HALDEMAN:No. One day, one day on an afternoonPRESIDENT:You don't think so?EHRLICHMAN:Well I think, I think&#8211; HALDEMAN:On an afternoon you told him apparently byphone--you didn't see him from what I could gather because he apparently talked to me afterwards. You said, "John, I want you tocome in here tomorrow morning at nine o'clockAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.45HALDEMAN:early in the morning and I want you to give methe entire story, everything, all the facts, because I don't have all the specifics.&#64258; Dean called me and said, "The President wants me to do this. I, uh, should I get into everything?&#64258; I said, "Yes, sir. That's a privilegedcommunication."PRESIDENT:But you don't know the date of that. HALDEMAN:Yes I do. PRESIDENT:When was that? HALDEMAN:I think it was the 20th. I can check but Idon't have it right here, but, I have it. Thereason you called him, one of the reasons--and Itold Dean at that time, give him everything and then the next morning you met with Ehrlichman for an hour and then Dean came in, met with Dean for about two hours, the last forty minutes of which you had me in.PRESIDENT:Probably to talk about this.HALDEMAN:I think so. That must have been the time thatwe talked about this because, uh, I recollect it as being an afternoon, but that afternoon you met with Ehrlichman and Dean and with me, but it was in this office not over there and I know the meeting that I remember was in the OvalOffice.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:This one about our concern was uh, the&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:The reason you called Dean and asked for thisinformation was you were on our backs, very hard, to get a statement out of him.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And we kept telling you, we couldn't, that wekept running into blind alleys and there doesn't seem any way to crack this. And finally weAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.46EHRLICHMAN:suggested to you that you talk to Dean, becauseDean was saying to us, rolling his eyes and saying, uh, you don't wanna know that or I don't wanna get into that with you. And we could never crack this. And so, we decided that one way to satisfy you on this would be for you to hearfrom Dean in a privileged conversation, what thefacts were. Now we decided that without ourselves knowing what the facts were.PRESIDENT:You know the date of that. Well, as soon as wecan&#8211;HALDEMAN:These things (unintelligible) find out.PRESIDENT:Well, it's very important that, uh, see I didn'tuh,&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:See this came out of La Costa. La Costa was fortwo reasons. One was to talk about what we do about the Ervin problem. The other was that all though my notes of the proceeding month, you're saying damn it, we gotta get a statement out.We gotta get something out that will satisfy(unintelligible). Remember the (unintelligible) letter. We gotta get something out that we can show (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well, I have a fairly good, I think, recordduring that whole period, uh, March 21st 'tilabout (unintelligible)&#8211;EHRLICIIMAN:This goes back PRESIDENT:&#8211;I told Ziegler today to say why didn't he do itbefore March 21st. He said well, on March 21st he personally began his own investigation. Before that he had relied on others and now hepersonally, which I don't&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:March 21st is the morning you met with Dean.There must be, there must be, uh, twelve or fifteen different places in my notes and conversations with you over the proceeding six months where you are banging away on thenecessity of getting this to happen.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.47HALDEMAN:I have it too. 'If I--you know, time aftertime.EHRLICHMAN:And we kept coming back to you and saying&#8211; HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;uh, we can't.HALDEMAN:We will. We'll say...we'll we&#8482;ll get that.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, but, but we kept coming back to you with adry hole. We, we sat for five hours in La Costa and came up with three sentences. Now why was that? Well, uh, it, it, for the reason I've just suggested.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible with tape noise).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible with tape noise/REMOVED). Ithink my recollection of the Bittmanconversations is about correct then.HALDEMAN:I do too. PRESIDENT:I, uh--you know what I mean? For, uh, blackmail--I didn't. I simply, the only thing that I,uh., it's unfortunate, uh, to, I said, "Well,John, look what it would cost to keep (unintelligible) for four years? (Unintelligible) dollars. Well, I guess we could get that kind of money.&#64258; You remember how I said it.HALDEMAN:But then we turned it off. I mean this, thiswas&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well, I didn't get that man. I think, I thinkthat somebody said that my God, you jus--, you can't do that. You know what I mean?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Let's not worry about it. Let me listen to(unintelligible),APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.48EHRLICHMAN:Well, right here try and disarm him. He may--uh, uh, I&#8482;m morally certain he does not know that he is on tape. And, uh,PRESIDENT:I wonder if he has, has a tape himself. EHRLICHMAN:That might be. That might be, and&#8211; PRESIDENT:Is it possible that he carries a tape? Does hedo that? Do you know of?EHRLICHMAN:I don't know that he does that. But if he everdid&#8211;PRESIDENT:I would doubt that he would to that(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Now that that point is raised. Larry said hecarried something in with him (unintelligible) atape recorder (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well, he carries with him, when he came with me,he didn't have a briefcase. But, can he carry it in his hip or something?HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). But it's done. PRESIDENT:It is?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Those things almost always go haywire.HALDEMAN:Then he can't use that tape anymore. (Tapenoise) privileged conversation.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) tape of a privilegeconversation&#8211;PRESIDENT:(Laughs). Privileged conversation is all goingout the windowEHRLICHMAN:That's the point, if privilege were of any usehere, why, uh, uh, you know, we wouldn't have a problem. But I, I think that what he's, what he's doing here trying to block (unintelligible) President on the basis that no confession of acrime is privileged and if a President's guiltyAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.49EHRLICHMAN:of a crime, and that, by golly, he'd better get(cont.)immunity in this thing. Or that's what's gonnahappen.HALDEMAN:Okay. Let's assume the worst then, which isthat that's exactly what it is. Then you don't have only one route. You say, immunity is theprice (unintelligible), we have to pay. That,that we--my argument would be that that&#8482;s the worst thing you can do, because that then puts you in as a permanent hostage for the rest of your life to, to John Dean and, and if you look beyond that to Henry Petersen, and beyond thatprobably to Silbert and Glanzer and to the courtreporter and others.EHRLICHMAN:Two the lawyers in Rockville. HALDEMAN:Yeah, Dean's lawyers, etc. If you, if--as soonas you let them go that way, then you are admitting the problem. And it seems to me that your only route re--really your only real routeis to destroy Dean rather than to--rather thanto perserve him perhaps which is what that does.PRESIDENT:Yeah. ERHLICHMAN:I think it's too soon to know. Obviously thisroad goes two directions.PRESIDENT:Yep.HALDEMAN:And when we see what the, what you have, whythen we'll know much more clearly or you'll know what you have.PRESIDENT:How could you? Let's just take, uh--possibly&#8211; HALDEMAN:Alright. PRESIDENT:How could you destroy him.EHRLICHMAN:We call Petersen in and, uh, just, and say, uh,Dean apparently had a conversation with Higby yesterday. Uh, (tape noise) I had a conversation.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.50EHRLICHMAN:with Dean, whenever the last time it was thatyou had a conversation with Dean where he asked us to sign those, sign those letters and maybe it was on another occasion. Say, "Henry, I do not have any overt, concrete, uh, satisfactory documentary evidence and that I'm beingblackmailed here, but that is the distinctimpression that Mr. Dean gives me. I want to tell you that this President is not subject to blackmail, and I want this turned on Dean. I want you to lay a trap for him. I want you to determine whether or not he is attempting toblackmail me, or, uh, indirectly you. And Iwant the full weight of the law to fall on him if that's what he's up to.&#64258; Now, you may not, you see, you may not catch him&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;Petersen may not want to, may not want to doit. There may be all kinds of things, but atleast, the important thing&#8211;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) what do you say about him? EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, he turned the thing &#8218;round in the oppositedirection&#8211;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:He's probably bought Henry Petersen already.PRESIDENT:I, I, (unintelligible). Yet, I think he is onthis business of information.HALDEMAN:What's that? (Unintelligible) Petersen who areallied with the President as a fellow blackmailee. It might (unintelligible):EHRLICHMAN:All, all I'm suggesting is that, that there isanother direction to go and it's stronger I think, than, uh, from the standpoint of the President, than, the immunity thing, which&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.51PRESIDENT:Well, I can't--I don't know. I guess you&#8482;reright. You go the immunity route...HALDEMAN:It&#8482;s one more cover-up. PRESIDENT:Yeah. It 's another cover-up. I&#8482;m trying tocover-up because&#352;trying to silence Dean. And frankly, if I said something was wrong then Ideserve to be impeached.EHRLICHMAN:Well, look at it this way, if you did, uh, andyou try to live it out, that way.PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:Youtalk about you got to get this cloud overand you got to start moving on to, uh, newdirections and doing your job. You sure as hellcan't do it that way.PRESIDENT:Well, but face it, basically, if I said somestupid (unintelligible). I'm not--I'm quite candid about it, I mean I (unintelligible) Christian Scientist. No, seriously John, I mean, if I, if, if Dean, if I was most(unintelligible) President. It would be allowed(unintelligible) even my counsel, (unintelligible). Jesus Christ, I thoughtat least we could talk to our people (unintelligible), Dean and everybody. (Unintelligible) bad him in.HALDEMAN:Well, see that's the other way to destroy Dean,is not only by Petersen trapping him but by the President--if we had the argument here that the President's got to go out and do something, which is an argument that, that, seems to be strongly made by everyone. That, uh, you canget out and take the following steps. You cantalk, that's--the obvious answer is always the President goes out on TV, talks to the people. Well, let's say at some point you have to do that. Okay? You hit them that you're their leader, or you present yourself as their leader,in time of crisis even when it's your owncrisis. And that they've gotta understand and share the agony that you've been going through. ThatAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.52HALDEMAN:you can and must suspend, uh, take theresignation of John Dean. You can't operate the Presidency by threat. You don't say this, but this is what you gotta do. You have to remove the threat in order to do it and you say that that's what you've done. Th-, this is a manwho's disserved you.EHRLICHMAN:The American people-- you gotta go on theassumption that the American people want to believe in their President.HALDEMAN:I think that's absolutely true. And they wantyou to say it isn't true, and if--when you sayit they're gonna be, they're gonna say I'm glad"he said it. But you're gonna have to hang somewhere (unintelligible). You've got to accept ultimate blame for what happened.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Which moves--removes you from the actual guiltof the, you know, the&#8211;PRESIDENT:Individual act.HALDEMAN:&#8211;individual act. PRESIDENT:I already have that. HALDEMAN:And go through all you&#8482;ve accomplished, you&#8482;vegot to go on accomplishing that. Order Petersen to get this thing brought to Justice, uh, andindicate that some of your closest aides havecome under attack, and that uh, uh, you have been informed that they're not guilty, but they are responsible for what's done. And, uh, so, but if anything comes out then--, then they've had it. (Unintelligible) that you can't use agimmick to cover up which I think our pullingout early maybe does. Maybe you then got to take the offensive in saying as to where this does show there has been something wrong in American politics. This campaign has been subject to the most microscopic scrutiny, theAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.53HALDEMAN:only microscopic scrutiny that any Presidentialcampaign's ever been subjected to and it doesn't stand up, well you're sad to see, by that, any more than any other campaign would and that doesn't make it good. That makes' it bad. Because bad--you, you're gonna lead a crusade asa, asa, uh, retiring President In changing theAmerican political campaign structure. So I think you've gotta play some, that kind of game somehow.PRESIDENT:Sure. HALDEMAN:'Cause, there's just too much other stuff comingout. It isn't the Watergate, it's this guy--allthis financing shit. And, and., uh, the, uh, appearances of, of problems in that way, and the things that we did. That we admit we did. The Segretti business and the having hecklers at rallies and the, the, uh, you know, all that kind of stuff. I think we gotta say that that--we did it because we had to in self-defense. Wedon't apologize for it, but looking at it now, now that finally someone's looking at a campaign, it ain&#8482;t right.EHRLICHMAN:There's an angle in there too. Th, th--part ofthis is, is a product of our whole mediastructure.HALDEMAN:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:And that, uh, uh, campaigns today, uh, didn'tjust spring full bloom from foreheads of campaign managers. They are the product of the, of the condition (unintelligible) so to speak.PRESIDENT:Well, of course, finding out without trying tosay well, "they did it, we did it," that, uh, uh, (unintelligible-tape noise) for example about the letters, uh, the wires, uh, generated at the Ma--, the May bombing. We generate wires all the time. We try to, uh, consult with theother side just as a common practice it, it's--that, that I think can be (unintelligible).APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.54PRESIDENT:I, I don't know who was the asshole over there -- he said we never (unintelligible) somebody in the Reelection Committee.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) Post story. (unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) All that now. HALDEMAN:You gotta assume that, that&#8482;s they're turning inthe Colson stuff, that story is the first tocome of all of that coming out, I think because it's it&#8482;s, uh,&#8211;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Part of that. We're gonna be faced with that. EHRLICHMAN:They have, uh, apparently, th-the key to that inmy other notes on my talk with O'Brien. O'Briengave me the rundown on these various expenditures and, uh, it would look like they, they had (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:&#8211;spent a lot of money. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;(Unintelligible) there's a lot of money. HALDEMAN:They're gonna (unintelligible) out one by one.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. And you could make it, you could make abig story on each one. Bringing the Cubans up here to, uh, be counter-demonstrators and uh, all that sort of stuff. (Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Some of the stuff I think we can survive. HALDEMAN:I do too.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) but it'll be a&#8211;HALDEMAN:But it's just all more, more credit. PRESIDENT:Uh, huh. (Unintelligible)&#8211; HALDEMAN:The thing you can't survive is, is Presidentialcupability. And that, I don't think there is.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.55PRESIDENT:Well, basically&#352;let me put it this way. Uh, youshouldn't survive if the President was culpable out there. But in this instance, uh,&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:But you're not. PRESIDENT:&#8211;apparently (unintelligible) being forced.(Unintelligible) (tape noise) suggests fromunreliable sources and so forth and so on.HALDEMAN:You didn't know about those. PRESIDENT:I never saw any. HALDEMAN:No, sir. PRESIDENT:It never came to my desk. HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:So I know nothing about anything of that sort.HALDEMAN:There&#8482;s no way to make that case at all or evenimply it.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible), as far as afterwards isconcerned, the only conversation I remember in the summer even, the only conversation in the summer involving--with John I walked on thebeach, and he said, "Eventually the problem withthese people--" maybe you had already made the call to Kalmbach, at that point. You didn't talk to him?EHRLICHMAN:No, I don't believe so. I think it was laterthat month or the following month. We can't pinit down very closely.PRESIDENT:But anyway, but you said, "You know, I think theproblem of, uh, these defendants is gonna be thing, be bigger than--there are higher-ups in it.&#64258; Right?EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:We didn't, we didn't --even then though wedidn't, talk about Mitchell being in, did we?APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.56EHRLICHMAN:Didn't know it. I...PRESIDENT:Or Magruder EHRLICHMAN:I had&#8211; We still don't know it. I still don'tknow it. But, but, at that time, all I had was a, a lingering suspicion. As a matter of fact, it wasn&#8482;t until the end of the month, I hope youremember the details of our walk, but you keptsaying to me, "Is Colson in this?&#64258; And I kept saying, "I don't know.&#64258; And, and&#8211;HALDEMAN:At that time you thought he was. EHRLICHMAN:I thought he was. PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And I would be very guarded about this wholething because I thought Chuck was up to his ass in this thing. That was in July. That was a month after.PRESIDENT:All right. Then, uh, the (unintelligible) theclemency thing.HALDEMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:The clemency plan was raised by Chuck with me.But it was handled totally responsibly. That I remember. It was right in this room. This (unintelligible) and he said, "What about clemency for Hunt, because of his wife?&#64258; I said, "Chuck, I feel sorry for the fellow," andso forth and so on, that of course would have tobe considered, but that's all I said. And I don't think Colson was going to get his tit in a wringer on that one.HALDEMAN:No. He&#8482;s very, he's very solid about that. Hesays that area&#8211;PRESIDENT:That is the only time clemency was everdiscussed with him. I--do you recall any others?APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.57EHRLICHMAN:I do not.PRESIDENT:Then that--there's no discussion of that(unintelligible) with Dean?HALDEMAN:What about with Mitchell? PRESIDENT:Mitchell never, never, never raised the subject.I didn't talk to Mitchell about this matter. Do'you realize that?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. That's why&#8211; PRESIDENT:I,&#8211; HALDEMAN:Look at (unintelligible) these press stories putout.PRESIDENT:I never talked to Mitchell, period.HALDEMAN:One of the stories now says that, that, uh,"Mitchell visited the President&#352;had to know about what was going on or something because he met daily with John Mitchell." (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:You could get that out&#8211; HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)&#8211; PRESIDENT:I&#8211;HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) with John Mitchell.PRESIDENT:Then I never met with him alone. We can all(unintelligible) in those meetings in the Oval Office. That, that frankly is, uh&#8211;HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:&#8211;is, uh&#8211;HALDEMAN:No, they were talking about back in January,which you were meeting daily with John Mitchell&#8211;PRESIDENT:January?APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.58HALDEMAN:&#8211;setting up the campaign plans. So you had toknow about the intelligence plan.PRESIDENTS:Never, never, never. That was, uh, perhaps youought to go back over and see him. It might be worthwhile (unintelligible) how often do you think (unintelligible)?HALDEMAN:I don't know.PRESIDENT:How often was it? HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) to that period(unintelligible). That's easy to do. It was virtually, you know&#8211;PRESIDENT:I don't remember that. Why I didn&#8482;t discuss thecampaign with Mitchell. I was, I honestlyfrankly, working on other things.HALDEMAN:Sure as hell were. PRESIDENT:I wanted to stay out of that. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) left it to other people. See? PRESIDENT:So there's that. Then the other thing. Youknow, the other thing is basically this lastconversation with Dean. But, let's take that atit's very worst now. At it's very worst. That has to be played flat out. That at that time I had a grave suspicion of Dean and I had to find out what the story was.EHRLICHMAN:You were then in about your tenth hour ofconversation with him that night or something&#8211;PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, and if you were thinking something wasfishy, why can't we get something now? God damn it, somebody's got to tell me what the facts are on this.PRESIDENT:When did I bring you (unintelligible) you intothe matter?APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.59EHRLICHMAN:30th. A week later.PRESIDENT:A week later. EHRLICHMAN:Now, the inter&#8211; PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) the week, that Dean spent overCamp David with order from you to get the thingwritten out.HALDEMAN:Exactly. EHRLICHMAN:See, he gave you some stuff, you know? PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:He came right out of those meetings with you,and you sent him to Camp David for six days.PRESIDENT:No. He went to Camp David&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:He was only supposed to take two days. PRESIDENT:There was a reason, there was a reason he wentto Camp David, as I recall, somebody had charged him with&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:That's right. Gray. HALDEMAN:Pat Gray said he'd lied.PRESIDENT:Something like that--the television was out.EHRLICHMAN:That was on (unintelligible)&#8211; PRESIDENT:Told John, "Get up to Camp David to try to&#8211;&#64258; HALDEMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:"&#8211;write this damn story out." HALDEMAN:Exactly.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.60EHRLICHMAN:And that, that occurred right about the timethat you were talking to Dean all through this thing. And that also shook everybody's confidence in Dean a little bit. Uh, the way that whole thing was handled. And so, uh, you sent him up there to put this thing down onpaper. At the end of two days, he said hedidn't have it done. We were then on the coast as I recall&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well, I didn't see him in that (unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:You were out of town. You were out of town allthrough that&#8211;HALDEMAN:You never saw, you never saw him again. Until,you know, just the recent stuff.EHRLICHMAN:But anyway, uh, he came down from the mountain&#8211; HALDEMAN:&#8211;and you didn't see him.

HALDEMAN:Beginning of the month of March.(Unintelligible). About the tenth--from the tenth to the twenty (tape noise).PRESIDENT:Yes, right. This is a critical point, you haveless than twelve hours.EHRLICHMAN:I, I can work back. In fact I can tell you thedays that we knew about (unintelligible) Bittman with this calendar. Bringing it now. The reconstruction of your life for a year is, uh, is, uh, rough adventure&#8211;HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) goes on.EHRLICHMAN:(Tape noise) also, catalog month by month, theissues that you were involved in. The heavy issues on the domestic side. (Tape noise). What was really going on here through this time and why you and I and others just didn't have time for this.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.62(Ehrlichman and President conversation--Haldemanon Telephone)(6-seconds Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Dean&#8211; HALDEMAN:I see, fine. PRESIDENT:I guess.HALDEMAN:Will you, uh, get a hold of a guy&#8211;PRESIDENT:I, I've still gotta be sure it was Petersen. I,I directed day after day to him I said, "Now that's your decision, if that's the way (unintelligible).&#64258;HALDEMAN:&#8211;to continue for the period of March 20th toMarch 23rd.EHRLICHMAN:Possibility that you okayed&#8211; HALDEMAN:Have him put it in a (unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Okay (unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Put it in something (unintelligible) bag so itdoesn't&#8211; Have him bring it to you and also get a, uh, machine that is technically capable oflistening to, uh, (tape noise) simplesubstantive (tape noise).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).(Haldeman Hangs Up Phone)PRESIDENT:Try to pick the date right away&#8211; HALDEMAN:Yeah, yeah, hold on.PRESIDENT:&#8211;try to get that out of the-, there.HALDEMAN:I think that's the morning of the 21st. I thinkthat's the (unintelligible) I think. The meeting that we had that morning. That's the only time I can (unintelligible). She doesn't know when the meeting was with Dean (unintelligible)...APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.63EHRLICHMAN:I can set the time frame from when Bittman--problem was here.HALDEMAN:I can figure that out. The 20th or 21st(unintelligible). Could have been the 20th.PRESIDENT:Looking, John, at Dean being the problem and soforth is that there a possibility--how would youfind it?EHRLICHMAN:Well, uh, I 'd slam him before he could slamyou.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:I understand that, but, but, uh, a word, uh,it's a question of, uh, what, what goes fromwhere.PRESIDENT:I appreciate that.(Pause)HALDEMAN:I don't think that's a good&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:John Dean saw the President for&#8211; HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;forty-five minutes on Monday&#8211;PRESIDENT:Monday what?EHRLICHMAN:Monday the 19th&#8211;HALDEMAN:But that isn't one. EHRLICHMAN:Sixty minutes on Tuesday the 20th&#8211;HALDEMAN:That isn't it. PRESIDENT:Oh, yes&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:A hundred and five minutes on Wednesday the 21st&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.64HALDEMAN:It's more than that. It's a hundred and ten.(Unintelligible/REMOVED) here at the EOB withMitchell. And then he met later in the day herewith you and me.PRESIDENT:Look, I don't care about all those meetings, yousee what I mean. I just want the ones that Ialone had with him. I don't&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:And there were a lot of meetings the previousweek.HALDEMAN:We can&#8211; PRESIDENT:I know. You apparently made no notes then, Bob,of your meeting with Dean and me with regard tothe Bittman conversation.HALDEMAN:It's very surprising. PRESIDENT:But, incidentally, Dean, Dean made no noteseither.HALDEMAN:Is that what he says? PRESIDENT:He never made notes when he was in my officethat I recall. He never made notes, that's whyI wondered if he had a recorder. I wonder--Iwonder if it&#8482;s possible he carried a recorder (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:It is possible. But it's highly unlikely. EHRLICHMAN:Dean went to Camp David the 23rd. He was thereon the 28th. We were in town the whole time.You didn't go to San Clemente until the 30th.PRESIDENT:Well, I was in town that week working on aspeech.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, yeah. And, uh. PRESIDENT:I called him three or four times while he was upthere, at least.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah. He was there all by&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.65PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) middle of the week. And then itwas, it, he came back the 28th. The 29th is (unintelligible). The 30th is when you asked me to take over.HALDEMAN:You didn't see him&#8211;PRESIDENT:The reason I asked you to take over was he wasso easily--what'd I say?EHRLICHMAN:You said "Dean is up to his ear, ass, ears,elbows, something, in this, and he simply cannot be permitted&#8211;PRESIDENT:It because he had charges of, in his conduct ofthe FBI and all of this?EHRLICHMAN:No. You didn't, you didn't even elaborate thatone. You just said that, that you had the feeling--you, you brought this right out of right field, This was not a subject we were discussing. You raised it, and you said to me, "Dean is in this so deeply that I just can'thave him continue. You're gonna have to getin."HALDEMAN:It was, it was--I think that one was acombination of factors. There was this problem with the FBI and, uh, uh, the Pat Gray business and your dissatisfaction that we weren't gettinganything out of (unintelligible), and Dean wasbeing hammered at that point. I was reporting to you on that (unintelligible) about his own problems. And, uh, he was, we were into at that point, we were into the, the start I think, of the problem of Dean versus Mitchell on whetherthere was a meeting or not. Uh,&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Pre-planning meeting of the Watergate. I meanthe problem--if Dean, if Dean&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well, one thing I did (unintelligible) whether,whether in his testimony did&#8211;HALDEMAN:&#8211;hit the Grand Jury, would&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.66PRESIDENT:Would they meet with Mitchell?HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Well that was discussed. HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Or apparently had been. I, I discussed that&#8211; HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:&#8211;but I didn't tell 'em to change a God damnthing.HALDEMAN:Absolutely. EHRLICHMAN:And neither did I. All of that night, Dean wassits--looking tome for support on, I can't lie. I kept saying he didn&#8482;t--"Nobody's saying youshould lie.&#64258; He said, "Mitchell is sayin&#8482; Ishould lie."PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) John Mitchell (unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:It may I be you would say there would be--if youre gonna move on that, you gotta be sure, ya know, it's gotta be done.PRESIDENT:That's what I should have said, but I, ya know,what I mean.HALDEMAN:No, I think you did. PRESIDENT:Huh? HALDEMAN:I think you did. I don't think&#8211; PRESIDENT:(Tape noise) Dean at that point was talkingabout--when did he make his, uh, "draw up thewagons around the White House"?HALDEMAN:In the afternoon of the 21st, after the meetinghere as we walked out. And it was, that was when he said it on the steps going down this building, after Dean, Ehrlichman and I had met with you in here late afternoon.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.67PRESIDENT:That was when we had the Executive Privilege on,uh, meeting on the, uh--Mitchell too?HALDEMAN:He--no, Mitchell had met with us in hereearlier, mid-day.PRESIDENT:Oh, then Dean, Ehr-, what was that conversationabout?HALDEMAN:It was about the Ervin Committee.PRESIDENT:Yeah? HALDEMAN:And then Dean on the way out--I'd probably gotinto other things. I've got some notes on that. Then uh, then Dean on the way out said, ya know, "I keep thinking we should draw the wagons uparound the White House so there's nobody in herewho has any problem. The problems are outside. We can draw it up here and hold tight.&#64258; Well what I meant though is that the only one in here with any problem was him. And that was one route, he was tem-, he was looking routes. Go backwards and you can see. One route he waslookin' at was "give me immunity and let me goto the Grand Jury.&#64258; Pushed that one hard for a while. Then he was doing the "gather up the wagons around the White House and there's none of us that have any problems, let those guys to go down.&#64258; And then he went to the, then he,none of those were working. And then he startedin on the, on the blackmail route of his attack.PRESIDENT:He started with the (unintelligible), Bittman. HALDEMAN:'Well, uh--Bittman. Now, that wasn't blackmailat that time. That was the problem he was trying to figure out how to deal with it.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:&#8211;start as blackmail, at that time. HALDEMAN:I think so. And he, at some point he got intothe, using blackmail as a defense theory, but I don't know where that was.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.68EHRLICHMAN:Y-, y-, let me, uh, read you just two excerptsfrom my notes that may, (unintelligible)-- February 27, we'll go back. That was about the time that you began to meet first with Dean had any, any length and that--that was 25 minutes on that day. And here are the notes that I tookfrom what you said to me. "I disapprove theExecutive Privilege statement. It does not solve the non-appearance situation. Try to state the standard case and review the statement--quote until later. Phone Kleindienst and Dean and tell them to get into the gamequickly with regard to the Ervin Committee.Haldeman and Ehrlichman should stay out of this. The President should see Dean at once. Ehrlichman should immediately take over Congressional sales strategy (unintelligible) Domestic Counsel (unintelligible) other problems." Uh, then skipping, to March 20th,the day before your, your probably(unintelligible.). You have a meeting with Bush and I sat in. Bush raised the problem of the Watergate case building, urged that Dean being available to testify before the Ervin Committee. And then you said, "I suggest that the generalJohn Dean statement on the Watergate matterbeing prepared so Bush can send out along with, with assurances of cooperation. This will also serve to assist Ziegler. This would be the preferred method--write it out, so we gave copies to the Congressional leaders, etc." Imean it appears a dozen times. You are reallyworried about that (unintelligible)."Disposeof many of the pending questions, with regard to Chapin, Dean, etc. Deal with the Watergate matter, campaign. Also we should issue astatement by Maury Stans referring to thecampaign fund question. Answer the Kalmbach and other issues that have been raised. Dean should in effect prepare a brief on this. Things to be hit in the statement including the fact that the President wants the chips to fall where they may. That there was no White Houseinvestigation because the FBI was so thoroughlyinvestigating the other matters. That there was a White House investigation by Dean."APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.69HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;Why not put it down. -The President mustinsist that the facts not be hidden. Dean should brief the Cabinet on Watergate and answer questions. He could also brief the leaders&#64258;HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible tape noise) except was also onthe 20th that you told Dean you wanted him tocome out on the 21st of February and tell you the whole story.&#64258; You see, you were sort of getting on top. You were saying, "I want this statement.&#64258; Then you're saying, "By God, I've gotta know what this is. &#64258;Then you--then we, Ithink said, "You've gotta know because we're,we, we don't. We can't write this. He won't tell us."PRESIDENT:Well, Dean's story that (unintelligible) &#64257;cancerin the heart of the Presidency" speech, as he calls it now. Let me tell you the problem, the problem is--the aftermath of a money was raised,and so forth and so on. The Bittman thing camein. (Unintelligible tape noise) met with Mitchell the next day. I think I come before that.EHRLICHMAN:It didn&#8482;t come much before that. It was onlykickin' around here a couple of days. I don&#8482;tknow.PRESIDENT:When did th-, when did he talk to you aboutBittman.EHRLICHMAN:I believe he talked to me on the 20th in themorning.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) talk to you? That could havebeen (unintelligible). Did I say the 20th?EHRLICHMAN:Might have been, uh, I don't have any notes&#8211; HALDEMAN:See he wouldn't have to, because it was theBittman thing and was a direct threat to Ehrlichman. (Unintelligible) done to Ehlichman.PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah. My point is though that I&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.70HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Your recollection, of any part of the meeting,you were in, why you&#8482;re gonna get the tape, you'll find out what that--I did not tell Dean to go out and raise the money (unintelligible) John? Bob?EHRLICHMAN:(Tape noise) The Bush (unintelligible) so tospeak&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:(Tape noise) is the foundation for your havingthe long session with Dean the next day.PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah.EHRLICHMAN:The point is what did&#8211;PRESIDENT:&#8211;whether or not I suggested that, uh, to Dean,well we've got to get the, get the money. I may have said that, I may have said that. And, if I did, what the hell's the defense for that John?EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. It would depend on how it cameout. It may be that, uh, it was, uh, uh, youcould, you can say, uh, "I was on aninvestigation kick. I was (unintelligible) I intended to, I intended to find out how far this guy was in this. I wanted to see what his response would be. Uh, the fact that he didn't uh, respond to me by saying, &#64257;Mr. President, Icouldn't do a thing like that "(Unintelligible)about this and I probably couldn't have worked any other way.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:Yes. The-, the two were, that day, that veryday, you must&#8482;ve instructed him to "write thisdown.&#64258; Two days later.PRESIDENT:I probably, more likely to have said, "Look, uh,I think I'm more likely to have said, uh, (unintelligible) this is a Mitchell problems," or something like that. But, uh, it's&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:That's what he was keeping from everybody.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.71HALDEMAN:The problem you've got if you follow this routenow is how do you explain the coddling Dean up to now?PRESIDENT:Well, the, the, we haven't got the, the, thepoint is that, uh, Dean--well basically because Petersen has told him, told me to.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Petersen has said, "We're trying to, uh, getDean to testify and to plea.&#64258; Uh, therefore, like I said, I've asked him. I said, "Should I ask for his resignation?&#64258; He said, "No.&#64258; Now, that's, I think we&#8482;ve got a pretty good casethere. (Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Then why didn't you follow his advice and getour resignation?PRESIDENT:What? HALDEMAN:Apparently he told you he wanted you to get ourresignation.PRESIDENT:Yes, he did. He did. He and Kleindienst bothdid. They said, "They ought to resign." And Isaid, "No," et cetera, et cetera.HALDEMAN:That's rather incredible, to want us to resignand you to humor him.PRESIDENT:No, but, you see if&#8211; HALDEMAN:I remember, it was tied to the immunizing himand getting the (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:The context for the whole deal probably was theimmunizing. That and getting your resignations.HALDEMAN:(Tape noises) has some view that if he can comedown in our company he comes down better than if he comes down alone.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, yes. The press is getting more and moreimmobile, by far. In other words I'm saying that if John Dean will testify to Grand Jury that (unintelligible).APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.72PRESIDENT:Like what.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) set up a (unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah. HALDEMAN:Obstruction of justice and that he was just alittle fellow who carried it out.PRESIDENT:Haldeman said that. W-, we&#8482;re obstructingjustice.HALDEMAN:This morning. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. And there was another one last year th-,that, that you and I would be implicated by Dean and his testimony before the Grand Jury. It's quite, quite specific.PRESIDENT:Is that right? These things move fast. Goodthing I'm gonna see Petersen today. Probably it's a good thing I hadn't seen him before. (Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:And Dean's evidently come up with some newstuff. Because that was his information to Higby&#8211;PRESIDENT:Awful.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;on us. Uh, you remember he said, uh, that he,uh, the President knew some but, but no, not entirely all...HALDEMAN:&#8211;of what he was going to say. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;of what he was going to say. Well, thePresident knew some of what he was going to say.HALDEMAN:Whole lot, but not all, of what he was going tosay at the Grand Jury. He said, "I'm gonna (unintelligible) and tell the truth."REEL THREE BEGINSHALDEMAN:"The President knows most but not all of whatI'm going to say.PRESIDENT:I think for sure, you can be sure before theGrand Jury, they don't ever ask him about a conversation with the President. REEL TWO ENDSAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.73(Tape noise)PRESIDENT: (CONTINUED)I know that. Well, when I say the -- Petersen,says that's privileged I mean, I, nobody questions that.HALDEMAN:I think, I think, that&#8482;s that's right. That's --it has to stay that way until they decidethey're making a case against (unintelligible). Well that's one thing, when we go to the people, 'cause they can't make the case against the President. That's the execution (unintelligible with tape noise).PRESIDENT:Yeah. (Tape noise). Talk about now.EHRLICHMAN:No, I tell ya, this is a figment of myimagination this whole, the whole s--no figment but I sat and looked at the wall last night for an hour and tried to think this thing through. And that&#8482;s where I keep comin&#8482; out. And, that's the ultimate. The ultimate, uh,(unintelligible) here.PRESIDENT:Well let's take it as its worst which an hour ortwo.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Find out the basis, we were trying to find outwhat the basis of this was about the Watergateand why the and, why the 21st day is verysignificant, (unintelligible). I started on my own for the purpose of writing it out.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible with tape noise/REMOVED).PRESIDENT:The obstruction of justice thing could be areal, deal with one other thing.HALDEMAN:It could.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.74PRESIDENT:It could be the President was trying to obstructjustice.HALDEMAN:No, no, no. (Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) that is, that is, that also ispossible.EHRLICHMAN:And that is a good reason why (unintelligible).On an early process now, that this fellowdoesn't know how to handle uh,&#8211;(Noise)PRESIDENT:Well, to bring us back to subject A. Ah, let meI think we can, we, we've all wrestled with this thing (unintelligible). I think a lot hinges onhow we uh, what we do on the Dean problem. Uh,it certainly makes a lot of sense to me, on thing I can talk about is that to have Dean, Haldeman, and Ehrlichman put it in a bag, is wrong (tape noise) not only from an individual standpoint, but it's wrong from the standpoint of what we know. In other words, whatculpability -- Dean is culpable withoutquestion. Uh, he claims that, you know, his Haldeman and Ehrlichman whoever he may (unintelligible). That's his line with me all the time, with everybody else, I assume. And, uh, Haldeman and Ehrlichman were not--the onepoint that I didn't need a particularly bull-headed uh, hedging on is a (tape noise) subornation of perjury. On that Haldeman and Ehrlichman were not there. Magruder&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) Haldeman and Ehrlichman didn'tknow all the way what Dean wanted.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.75HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) what Dean wanted.PRESIDENT:You didn't discuss with Dean the fact that, lookthe-- be sure you guys get a good story (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Oh, no, Jesus, no sir. Absolutely not. EHRLICHMAN:This whole, this whole story of the warm upmeetings and the problems with Dean being inthose meetings and, uh, who was there, and all that business came to me the first time in March when we discovered that there was a conflict between Mitchell and Dean which Mitchell began calling Bob about and saying you can&#8482;t let thisguy testify. And really the Ervin thing is whatlit that all up. You know&#8211;HALDEMAN:Well then, wel&#8482;ll (unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:And then we got into it and began asking "Wellwhat is the problem, what, what is the conflict?" And then it came out, for the first time, and that's only in the last 45 days, 60days.PRESIDENT:Dean, and&#8211; (pause) I understood -- Ididn'tknow this before, that Dean and Magruder are supposed to be mortal enemies, now each trying to do the other in.HALDEMAN:That's not surprising.EHRLICHMAN:It isn't that. And, uh, Magruder of course intalking to me, held Dean responsible for having contrived the story and, uh&#8211;PRESIDENT:that Dean told him to say. Is that right? EHRLICHMAN:Constructed the cover story, coached him on how&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.76PRESIDENT:This is after he had talked to the U. S.Attorney.HALDEMAN:Yeah EHRLICHMAN:Yeah-but Magruder told me that before in themeeting I had with Magruder and Mitchell that day.PRESIDENT:What did he say?HALDEMAN:He said the same thing. Dean had told him tosay. He said Dean can&#8482;t go out and undercut my story because the reason I gave my story was Dean told me to. I could have easily said there were the two meetings it wouldn't have made anydifference to, to my case, but Dean told me notto because they wanted to keep Dean's name out of it. Mitchell was present when that happened and Mitchell admits he was present when that happened. (Unintelligible with tape noise) meeting in Becker's office. In other words O.K. all detailed (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well, Dean has certainly--well, Magruder hastold that story.HALDEMAN:That if you recall (unintelligible) that I wasworried about at the time we were talking about going up to testify and all that saying I have information that I don't have to testify to, Idon't know if it's true but I know what wastold.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:But, if it is hearsay, in that sense, then it'shearsay (unintelligibile with tape noise) testify to that because of being put in aposition of incriminating Mitchell. Why do youthink I was incriminating&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.77EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, I (unintelligible) Bittman thing.PRESIDENT:I don't know (unintelligible). You remember mysaying to Dean well look, for Christ sakes takes care of him. Be sure the son-of-a-bitch doesn't talk.EHRLICHMAN:I think actually, you've got a good point here,on this suborning of perjury thing's a prettygood example of the, of the kind, of, of ignorance we were living in over here with regard to what Dean was doing. Now, it's also true, over in the money department, in the pay- off of the defendants, the hush-up money.PRESIDENT:How's that?EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;that we were, we were basically in the dark asto what Dean was doing, except when he would come to us on a specific, specific instance as he did when he needed us to get Kalmbach. I, I have a hunch that if we hadn't had to lock on Kalmbach the way we did, he'd of just shortcircuited us out and, gone direct to Kalmbachand, and done it that way, but he discovered that Kalmbach would not take orders from him.PRESIDENT:But he, but he, Dean, wanted the money for hush,here again.HALDEMAN:I don't know that.EHRLICHMAN:Ah, at that time which was in July and August&#8211;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Mitchell. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;I think not. I think they had monumentalattorneys' problems and that they were legitimately concerned about how to hire counsel for these guys and that&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.78HALDEMAN:&#8211;then now to retain them. For example, afterthey got counsel, counsel was walking on.PRESIDENT:See, they, they got very high-powered guys likeF. Lee Bailey's office, and, and others. And they must have had big money problems.HALDEMAN:Well, we know that. Some lawyer -- it was oneof their the suits, Hunt's lawyer, somebody, raninto our attorney on the street, I mean our attorney on .the street and said the son-of-a- bitch still owes me $100,000 or something.PRESIDENT:Hunt does? HALDEMAN:Yeah (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:He'd been promised, he'd been promised cashpayment in full, and, and received. twenty-five hundred dollars. So, uh, I think at the time Herb got into this, that&#8211;PRESIDENT:It was in your view, it was your concern, it wasattorney's fees, perhaps it&#8482;s the same&#8211;HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:&#8211;time, you gave the three-fifty, ordered thethree-fifty.EHRLICHMAN:Well, he's getting that, he's getting morecompelling of three-fifty, because it certainly can be, I think, successfully argued that there was no motive at all after being in the WhiteHouse, (unintelligible)&#8211;HALDEMAN:&#8211;after the hush, I couldn't care less whathappened if they got burned, I didn't know, I didn't know what was going on there, or who was where, in fact&#8211;(ALL TALK AT ONCE)PRESIDENT:&#8211;(unintelligible) one story kicking around, thatwas forty, forty was the election and some afterwards. Is that correct or not?APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.79EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) cause I don't know. I'm toldthat it was all after the elections but that there were two chunks, that there were a chunk of 40 and then another chunk. You see they put (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;Magruder did. (Tape noise) tellStrachan (unintelligible). Magruder. They believe Magruder and they don't believe Strachan. I said, "Well, what the hell is it about?&#64258; I said well, I said, "At what point?&#64258;Well, it's about Strachan&#8482;s having furnished uh,the budget and tape.&#64258; No--not that about, Magruder had furnished it to Strachan. I said, "Well, what about Haldeman?&#64258; Well on that the lie detector, well it, wasn't as clear on that, so I gotta little something outta that.EHRLICHMAN:So that's the question whether Magruder had senta budget over here, that said they were (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:That fact, and two questions: one whetherMagruder sent it, whether Strachan and what Strachan&#352;RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:Well, they can't ah, I mean they're gonna proveit at some point. They can't get by on justMagruder because Magruder's gonna be a convicted perjurer by that time. So, uh, Strachan's uh -- and the lie detector probably isn't admissible.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.80PRESIDENT:Oh, he claimed that, that (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible). So, they still gotta make acase on Strachan.HALDEMAN:That's amazing that they&#8482;d use that. I, Ithought they didn't use lie detectors.PRESIDENT:Well, they do it sometimes and he said we justcame to the point where there&#8482;s a question ofwho is lying and they didn&#8482;t force him. (Unintelligible) said, "Sure,&#64258;. (Unintelligible) said, Sure. I think Strachan is the more likely to be telling the truth than Magruder, I think Magruder basically is aclassical liar&#8211;HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:&#8211;Magruder can pass any lie detector test andStrachan will be -- figure God damn that's a sensitive (unintelligible) jiggle up and down that's another reason the lie detector goes down.HALDEMAN:You see Strachan could be at -- in telling thetruth, thinking that's gonna be, this is gonna be harmful (unintelligible) jiggle (unintelligible) but -- I listened to 'em both and&#8211;PRESIDENT:Did you talk to Strachan?EHRLICHMAN:Yes sir. I talked with both on the subject, andI think Strachan's more believable on the explanation which is "If I had ever seen anything like that, I'm sure I would have remembered it.&#64258; And that's a -- you know I mean he's very categorically (unintelligible) sametime, uh, have a, just may have somerecollection of having seen it, you know. And I, I wouldn't be in a position to know. But I had to, I had to, decide in my own mind who was telling the truth on that and I came down on (unintelligible) conflict (unintelligible)Bittman business&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.81PRESIDENT:(Tape noise) you mean there. I, uh, we wereinformed that, uh, that the attorney fees had been taken care of. Here&#8211;HALDEMAN:Good PRESIDENT:I was present. HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:When -- at any time did Dean ever tell me that?HALDEMAN:I, I don't know. It's possible that, that cameup in a meeting here that afternoon.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:I don't recall it at all -- but it pushed thequestion, I, I would say that's possible. But,uh&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:(Tape noise) does ring a little bell.(Unintelligible). Was I, was I here?HALDEMAN:Yes. EHRLICHMAN:I yeah and somebody said Mitchell says that'sall taken care of.PRESIDENT:That would still be consistent with thePresident trying to get at the God damn thing.EHRLICHMAN:(Tape noise) right, right. PRESIDENT:Or is it? EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, I don't (unintelligible), HALDEMAN:I can't say that happened. I'll check on it(unintelligible).APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.82PRESIDENT:What would you fellows answer for example if,uh, they ask you a question whether or not, uh, about -- and Dean testifys, that there was a discussion of uh, Bittman had to get paid off.EHRLICHMAN:Hey, before you make trouble on that, let'slet&#8482;s see what tapes do&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well, what the tapes say -- but I mean apartfrom the tapes, there's another conversation. I was not present at. What the hell do you say (tape noise) Mitchell would deny.EHRLICHMAN:For those three weeks I didn't really understandwhat the President was up to. See, the firstthing he did he took me off Ervin -- I'mspeaking now -- took me off the Ervin matter, said Dean's gonna handle this. And then he did a very unusual thing, he began seeing a lot of Dean which he didn't usually do, and I didn't know what was up, I didn't know what they were talking about, I couldn't get a hint, however,anything the President was saying to me aboutwhat he was up to with Dean I just knew he had gotten into this because he&#8482;d been pushing for a statement and couldn&#8482;t get one. The next thing I knew he'd sent Dean up to Camp David and then on the 30th he announced to me that Dean was inthis thing so deep that he had to take him out.So it was obvious then, in the hindsight that the President had been up to something this whole time. Now I can think back and think of bits and pieces and I can see he was playing a, a poker game&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well what about the questions or charges Deanhad made that, uh, Mitchell indicated at that time (unintelligible) taken care of.(Unintelligible/REMOVED).APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.83EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'd just say you, you were being prettyinscrutable with Dean all through that period of time.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) you had something(unintelligible) and on the 30th, I discoveredwhere it was.HALDEMAN:Now you might be interested in this, the phoneconversation that, uh, John Dean called me or I called him, on March 26th which was while he was up on the mountain and we had obviously discussed (unintelligible) the question wasraised that John -- that we ought to make anoffer for John Dean to go to the Grand Jury. And he said check with Dean and see if he has any problems and if we, if we do, do that. (Tape noise) Dean said there would be no problem. Then he, wanted to tell me about some of the things he had been working --brought meup to date -- he had just talked with JebMagruder about the (unintelligible) business, all that. Then he, then he obviously goes got into his notes, his notes that he was working on and reconstructing the situation &#8218;cause he says, "The main problem area that we're faced with isthe blackmail situation. "I was aware," this isDean talking, "I was aware that Mitchell and others were being black-mailed by those involved and I sought to ignore it, so I am vague on the specifics. First time I was aware of it was when Mitchell told me that the defendants wanted helpregarding money for bond. This was relayed fromMrs. Hunt to Bittman, to Parkinson, to Mitchell and LaRue, and they, the defendants were threatening to cause general havoc if they were not helped. Parkinson said he did not want to be involved further in this so Bittman usedO'Brien. O'Brien is unhappy with his roleAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.84HALDEMAN:(CONTINUED)in this, too. O'Brien reported the threats toMitchell and LaRue and Dean, and Dean passed on some of it to some people in the White House.&#64258; (Tape noise). Mitchell had to&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah, now that would mean&#8211;HALDEMAN:Here are the specifics on it. "After Mitchellhad the original draft, he told Dean to tell Haldeman and Ehrlichman that we needed to use Kalmbach money to raise, use Kalmbach to raise money, and he should get Haldeman and Ehrlichman to authorize this. Kalmbach raised the money anddelivered it per instructions to, perinstructions to LaRue, about $70,000. The next time there was a threat to the Committee, there was no money available. Stans and LaRue were aware that the 350,000 to the White House for polling. The White House had not met, had not spent this money and wanted me to return it. OnlyStrachan with Haldeman approval could spend themoney. There was one problem, about 22 thousand of it had already been spent, and I don't know the purpose." This is Dean. The problem was how to return the funds without a big deal in the press. So the funds just sat in Strachan's safe.Mitchell asked Dean to ask Haldeman for some ofthis money, assured that it could be replenished. Dean called Haldeman and said there was a bad situation here growing worse. LaRue or O'Brien said it was a crisis. Haldeman said to have Strachan get the money but to clear it as soon aspossible. Haldeman said to get all the money outof here and get a receipt for it. Strachan did get the money out but got no receipt. I amAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.85HALDEMAN:(CONTINUED)not aware of the extent of the threats to theCommittee." Those were two examples. He was not aware how far threats to the Committee went "but there were two blackmail threats to the White House. One, Mrs. Hunt, to Colson's secretary,made a veiled threat and Colson didn't know whatit was about, and referred it to Dean. Dean advised Colson to take no more calls from Mrs. Hunt and reported the incident to O'Brien. The second was when O'Brien told Dean that Hunt insisted on a meeting that he send a message toDean regarding a need for 72 plus 50 and that ifit was not received, he would reconsider his options and disclose the seamy things he did for Ehrlichman and Krogh. Dean advised Haldeman and Ehrlichman of this threat. Ehrlichman requested that Dean discuss this with Mitchell and Colson. Dean discussed it with Mitchell, but not Colson.Mitchell said in a later meeting it was noproblem.&#64258; There are Dean's notes. "(Tape noise) not in a position to fully evaluate the situation on blackmail. That all concerned made the point of dire threats to the White House and when people are being blackmailed they imaginethe worst.&#64258; That's all of this on blackmail.Now, he says, "Regarding clemency, O'Brien told Dean that, that Bittman was asked by Hunt to meet with Colson. Ehrlichman said Colson should meet with Bittman and he did. Colson said it was essential that Hunt be given assurance&#8211;&#64258;PRESIDENT:Colson said.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.86HALDEMAN:Yeah. &#64257;&#8211;and Ehrlichman agreed. Colson toldBittman that he could make no committment, but as a friend he would assist. He referred to Christmas as the time when clemency actions were usually taken, and Hunt was satisfied with this."PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I'm trying to say thatEhrlichman, uh, (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Well, I recall Dean -- I had two meetings, Dean,Colson, and me, in which this problemwas discussed and it was decided -- I, I had urged that Colson talk with Bittman&#8211;PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;because Hunt was obviously very distraught,very distraught, and that Colson not talk with Hunt&#8211;PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and that Colson be extremely circumspectaboutwhat he said to Bittman and we discussedclemency and Colson's recollectionand mine,both are that I was very categorical in saying you cannot in any way infer the possibility of clemency. Now this was late in the game. This was in January or February so there was already a lot of talk in the papers about hush money andI was very concerned that any inference could beraised in this meeting, that would in any way come back to you. That's the reason for stressing it, as I did. Colson had, had to meet with Bittman says he&#8482;d reduced the, the meeting to memoranda which I've never seen, but he said,-- he says that he did not in any way induceHunt's uh, (unintelligible).APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.87PRESIDENT:What if Colson were asked if he ever discussedit with the President?EHRLICHMAN:He tells me he did not. PRESIDENT:(Tape noise) discussed, I guess. HALDEMAN:That's what he -- remember you had me check withhim when we were down Key Biscayne, for a fewhours that, that afternoon.EHRLICHMAN:If I'm ever asked, I will say that I told Colsonflatly, never to discuss it with the President.PRESIDENT:Correct. Colson, Colson did discuss it but it,but it was -- I must say that conversation I'm not afraid of because anybody would have a rightto say -- he didn't say I have to, this or thator the other thing. He said that, uh, Hunt's in a hell of a shape&#8211;HALDEMAN:Colson has every intention (unintelligible) it'sto his overriding interest to do so. To say that any conversation he ever had with the President on any subject, he will not discusswith anyone.PRESIDENT:Yeah, that&#8482;s right. Well, I, guess I don't wantit to appear, though that he's covering up for somebody now.HALDEMAN:Yeah, but he'll say that on a consistent basis,so if it isn't -- in relation to this oranything else, it's, it's, uh, policy&#8211;PRESIDENT:He should also -- I (unintelligible) could say,I could say this is the subject you never -- I don't want to say discuss any conversation I (unintelligible)APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.88EHRLICHMAN:Except that Chuck was in bad frame of mind, forHunt at this time.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) over the whole thing and, uh,Colson was making a case for his going and talking to Hunt, for seeing and, uh, and hereally had on his mind he might do that.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I have to look at Hunt now.Hunt now realizes that no clemency's hangin&#8482; out there, he sure knows that, doesn't he. Huh?HALDEMAN:Well&#8211; PRESIDENT:Must be getting the uh, (unintelligible) goingaround here now. (Tape noise) Hunt might atthis time. Who else would take care of for example, nobody's gonna take of Hunt's kids now.EHRLICHMAN:Well, he doesn't need it now. See he got awfullot of money. His wife was heavily insured. So it may not have to save&#8211;PRESIDENT:Maybe not Hunt. What about Bittman, what's hegonna say?APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.89EHRLICHMAN:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;(unintelligible). Colson gave the proposition.PRESIDENT:When you get Bittman, (unintelligible), Isuppose.HALDEMAN:Yeah. I would guess so. I would(Unintelligible with tape noise)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). Bittman would say that Colsonsaid he had talked to the President and the President promised Hunt (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible with tape noise) to me he's,he's well prepared to handle that.PRESIDENT:I think we have a strong witness there,hopefully. It seems to me (unintelligible with tape noise).HALDEMAN:Yeah. (Unintelligible). I had a meeting withDean, Dean and Kleindienst and, uh, 45 daysafter the burglary&#8211;HALDEMAN:(Tape Noise) tremendous amount of information(unintelligible with tape noise).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible with Tape Noise/REMOVED) go tomy office, nobody bothers me there.(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:What's out there? HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) have a problem? PRESIDENT:Huh? HALDEMAN:I said (unintelligible) maybe we don't have aproblem.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.90PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). Assuming the problem as badas I set out. Let's face it though, we're looking at the problem in terms of saying look, sure God damn it, you got, get (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:You can ride that out. PRESIDENT:Well, the point is, that, uh, John's the, guy,who&#8482;s gotta make up the (unintelligible) defenseon that. We gotta say that ah, that was the President trying to find out what the hell this is about.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think the record is very good, on thatwe are&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Very good. PRESIDENT:Meaning what? EHRLICHMAN:Meaning that you're suspicious, of those factson the time we reported to you on the fruitlessness of the La Costa meeting back in February, and then you began to do a whole bunchof things you've never done before.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:You got fed up with the inability of each of us,to move from one to the other, not get a story out, to get it done. You hit me, and you hit John and then you hit both of us and then ya,you tell us to hit Dean, and you push aroundthis way, and then you finally haul Dean and Moore in and, and hit them. You hit MacGregor way (unintelligible)APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.91EHRLICHMAN:Clear back to last summer. And that date isbacked up by something that you told me, I don't think you saw at the start, but MacGregor and I got put crosswise at the start a bit. Well what lies behind that I discovered at getting back into my notes. I knew that I had urged astatement to be put out&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;(Unintelligible) at the time we went to Hawaii.When we were in Hawaii&#8211;HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) 'cause you liked it, cause Ihave notes saying I think we oughta follow theEhrlichman plan. It's, it's a good idea.EHRLICHMAN:The interesting thing is, it came from somethingthat the President said about three and a half weeks before that, about how you would like to get a statement out around that period of time one at the White House and one at the Committee. So that's, that's what planted the seed and thenit germinated and (unintelligible) now.MacGregor's forget is a little bit convenient. I had it on tape in a phone conversation of us about seven or eight several days ago in which he remembers a lot of these things and he forgets (unintelligible). But, uh, that&#8482;sneither here or there but the fact is, that,even back there in the (unintelligible) conversation (unintelligible) July or August you were pushing, as you have been through this whole course of things to get statements out, that explaining to people and over and overagain you hear let the chips fall where theymay. Let's get it out.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.92EHRLICHMAN:So I think, I think on the record you're, you'requick to chip&#8211;PRESIDENT:I can't be blackmailed. (Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Sure. PRESIDENT:I mean hell I deserve (unintelligible). HALDEMAN:It's almost, you're settin yourself up for it,because too many people know. You can't ridethat, you can't be sure you can ride that one out.EHRLICHMAN:RESTRICTED-&#64257;b&#64258;HALDEMAN: PRESIDENT:Let me, let's sort of, probably thrash it outhere, pretty much as to where it is. The way Ilook at the thing incidentally, I think we, wecan, we could consider the leave of absence thing. Could consider it, the possibility on the ground that, that, uh, the basic reason (unintelligible) because of the charges for this or that and the necessity (unintelligible). Itwould be coupled with a statement from theattorney, that I'm thinking now that because of the charges, two or three options here statement by the attorney that I have(unintelligible/REMOVED) whether you have to goto the Grand Jury so forth and so on and youneed time to prepare, you know, prepare for thatand so forth. (Unintelligible) essentialbusiness of the government go forward (unintelligible) these charges uh, going, uh, and so forth. We feel it's imperative that until, until the, they're cleared these charges in other words (unintelligible) cleared that youfeel that, uh, you're, uh, you're, uh,continuing in your duties, uh, but that you, that your ability, the faculty to your carry on your duties will be seriously impaired.(Unintelligible/REMOVED) poses a problem of, uh&#8211;HALDEMAN:Poses a hell of problem. When do you decideit's over?APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.93PRESIDENT:When do you decide it's over.HALDEMAN:But if he keeps the option open. PRESIDENT:At, at least the point is to buy a little timeand to leave the option open. When you see what builds, then you're able to see what Dean does say, you understand,HALDEMAN:That' s right.PRESIDENT:You're able to see what, uh, what other crapdoes come out right and then I would say until the Grand Jury acts, I'm not gonna judge this case- I'm not gonna judge it, I'm not gonna judge, anybody in it. I have to(unintelligible/REMOVED), have to, have toinclude all three at this point.HALDEMAN:Let me, let me argue a different approach. See--set of circumstances.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)(Pause)EHRLICHPMAN:Well, I don't know. I regard, argue freely thatyou've get three different kinds of situationshere.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:One you got Dean, whom I bet Petersen will tellyou is gonna be indicted. Uh,&#8211;PRESIDENT:Either that or he gets immunity.EHLRICHMAN:&#8211;Well, what even there he can't be givenimmunity for, uh, uh, suborning perjury. That doesn't reach us. Ah, he's gonna have to take a fall on that by himself and I think (unintelligible). I don't know what Petersen will tell you, but I suspect he'll tell you(unintelligible) gonna be indicted some basisand he'll get case immunity on things where he implicates other people. But that's something to ask Petersen about, but let's assume&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.94PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;(Unintelligible) indicted, then I think youcan, you could, you could say, "I've been advised by the Assistant Attorney General that, uh, John Dean is uh, (tape noise) uh, U.S. Attorney has indicated, uh, especially with,Haldeman (unintelligible).&#64258; There&#8482;s class ofcases where people in the White House have been, uh, uh, openly and notoriously charged with, uh, implications, uh, I answered that determination by, uh, uh, people in the in the judical process, I'm not gonna prejudge that situation,but I am gonna insist that people in thatsituation take a leave of absence at least, uh, and so that's the second &#338; until it's cleared up or firmed up by act of the Grand Jury. So that's the second classic case. Then, there's a, there's a third group of people in the White House who have not I been publicly charged withanything. But from my investigation, myunderstanding of this facts, have some direct or indirect involvement into the subject matter of the case. Uh, I know who they are. They know who they are, and my decision on them is to have them in place for the time being. With theexpectation that in the course and developmentof the prosecution in this case, they, they a firm body of facts will become available to me on which I can make a decision. Now that's the end of it, that's the end of that. Generalized, it's a generalized kind of thing. We made alist this morning to try and see who were in thesame boat as I am personally, in this. That is not charged with anything, with no evidence before the Grand Jury yet, with an incipient problem and there are 17 of us. In the same identical situation.PRESIDENT:Really?APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.95HALDEMAN:That's principals. I mean you're not looking atsecretaries or (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Like who? You know. HALDEMAN:You put me in the second category.(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:HALDEMAN:PRESIDENT:HALDEMAN:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;PRESIDENT:HALDEMAN:PRESIDENT:HALDEMAN: PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:&#8211;uh, uh, output and I think, I think does havesome involvement.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.96HALDEMAN:in the convention problems which(CONT'D)this focused around at that timeRESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;andRESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;PRESIDENT:Meeting about what? The, uh,&#8211;HALDEMAN:(Tape Noise) How to deal with, uh, with, uh, theWatergate problem uh, various points of time.PRESIDENT:Right. Right.HALDEMAN:And, uh, (tape noise). RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;I would say is more direct. Then you get thewhole problem with the press office. Ziegler? He was publicly accused of lying&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and who has handled a lot of privatetransactions with Dean. (Unintelligible) withDean and me in an effort to get Ziegler'spositionPRESIDENT:Yeah EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and is probably charged with by Dean withnotice of some of the things that I am charged with.HALDEMAN:Gerry Warren falls under the same problem asZiegler.PRESIDENT:Like for example Ziegler&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:Well, uh, I got in the calendar, half a dozenmeetings with Dean, Ehrlichman and Ziegler. It would be the kind of situation where, uh, McCord letter is about to come out and Dean would havehad inside information as to what it was. Andso we would sit down and talk about the press handling this. The Segretti matter, Zielger had all kind of inside information on Segretti which Dean got from his investigation.PRESIDENT:Right, right, right.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.97HALDEMAN:Gerry Warren sort of falls into the same thing.Ken Clawson is in there -- both in that area and in the Colson area during the campaign where he wasRESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;PRESIDENT:You're, you're now mixed, you're not includingnot only Watergate,...HALDEMAN:Including&#8211; PRESIDENT:&#8211;Segretti.HALDEMAN:&#8211;No, this isn't Segretti type stuff, this is,is&#8211;PRESIDENT:All Watergate? HALDEMAN:No, it's not Watergate either. EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) to rough-up the demonstrators. PRESIDENT:Campaign activities. I got that.HALDEMAN:Right, right.PRESIDENT:Ervin Committee. HALDEMAN:Ervin Committee at least, but it's coming outnow so it's gonna be press before Ervin Committee.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:And probably, will get in some way logged intothe Grand Jury business because of the money.PRESIDENT:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.98EHRLICHMAN:Well, now if, if the premise is that someone isgoing to be a problem to the functioning of the Presidency&#8211;PRESIDENT:Right. (Unintelligible) a hell of a lot. EHRLICHMAN:Then, you got to, there isn't any good place tostop without going all the way because if we'reoff the scene and we both take up farming inIowa&#8211;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;some day becomes justas big a problem to you as I might be, if I werehere. Because they haven&#8482;t got me to focus on.HALDEMAN:If they can't tell you who&#8482;s (unintelligible)proposition (unintelligible) the President.EHRLICHMAN:Well, (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:I think rather than to be specific about anindividual or individuals, you really have to par it off for yourself as kind of a generic classification, and decide what you're going to do about those people. You can do one of twothings. You can say I've checked this and itnow goes down with (unintelligible) and so they're all gone tomorrow morning. Or you can say there're shade and gradations on this thing but judicial process is underway. And I'm going, I'm going to let the remedy fit the crime, so to speak.HALDEMAN:Then what you have to do is as soon as(unintelligible/REMOVED) Higby, he goes.(Unintelligible) I don&#8482;t think very many of willprobably be targets. But in the press, the witness is a target.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.99PRESIDENT:True. (Tape Noise) Come down to their level.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I come down to treating Dean differentlythan Bob, Bob was different than me. And that's a self-serving kind of a suggestion, but it, it keeps coming back to me that this (unintelligible) treatment of Haldeman andEhrlichman that you're not really taking inaccount the different press posture in which we find ourselves at the moment.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:I agree. EHRLICHMAN:I stand at, at the moment, with all kinds ofpress calling my office saying, "Gee, why doeshe even have a lawyer?&#64258; And&#8211;PRESIDENT:Problem is with your having the same lawyer,(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;that's the problem and then we're past that,we'll be taking a chance on that&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and so on and, uh, uh, eventually we'llprobably have to make another (unintelligible). But we--if that was a mistake it was a mistake (unintelligible) but as far as the perception of the press of my situation now, they don't know really, that Dean has anything and as amatter of fact, that apparently the leaks outof, out of the, uh, prosecutor's office had down played my involvement. Now maybe that's the lull me or to trap me or something, but&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well I'll have to examine Petersen on that. EHRLICHMAN:That's, that's right and, uh, you would have tobe satisfied on that. Uh, I'm stuck with thisdilemma: if I, if, if Bob and I both take a leave, Monday, TuesdayAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.100EHRLICHMAN:morning I gotta start answering questions.(CONT'D)What do I say? Well you see there's this fellowand he says this and this about me and this is true&#8211;PRESIDENT:Let me ask you this then. You're not -- yousuggest nobody take a leave then.EHRLICHMAN:No, I don't. I, I suggest you fire Dean andthat Bob take a leave and that I be prepared to, I be prepared to take a leave&#8211;PRESIDENT:You? EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;the minute the charges surface. PRESIDENT:Well, why do you have Bob take a leave, becauseof this, uh,&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:'Cause he's already pretty well(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Named&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) so on and so forth. PRESIDENT:Yeah. And in your case EHRLICHMAN:This hasn't come out.PRESIDENT:That's true.HALDEMAN:Now, you've got no basis for, for&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:I know but&#8211; HALDEMAN:John had no basis for taking any action. PRESIDENT:That's right. Particularly with John. HALDEMAN:No apparent basis, uh.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.101EHRLICHMAN:But that doesn't gain me a whole lot except,that it divides me, PR wise, and to me that's some little advantage to be divided from Dean&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and to be divided a little bit from Bob in thesense that I don't, I don't share this 350transaction with him. And therefore&#8211;PRESIDENT:Also you, you don't share the 350 transaction,you also don't share even the question about did you see any of the tape&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:That's, that's correct. PRESIDENT:&#8211;which, of course (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:That's correct. PRESIDENT:There's&#8211; HALDEMAN:The charges, the official charges against us aredifferent.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). On the other hand, Deanbusiness, of your approving the bond, and thecover-up and all that sort of thing.EHRLICHMAN:And then the minute that surfaces&#8211; HALDEMAN:We're, we're joined on that, yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and then if that surfaces, that I oughta bailout of here.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:If that's the pattern we decide&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.102PRESIDENT:&#8211;but, but on a leave basis.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, and that would be my, that would be mythought, I have a, I have a real practical problem with, with a resignation, which shouldn't really weigh in your consideration.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:That's exactly it. (Unintelligible). Well, itis a factor only in this sense, that I then have to get a job, I have to go to work, (unintelligible) practicing law, I can. I mean that is not the problem. I can, I know that immediately where I go relatively good payingthing job. You wouldn't be terribly happy withit, but I would be terribly happy with it, but I would be in a kinda any port in the storm situation at that point. You're with me on that?ALL:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Uh, uh, to say again I wouldn't wanna to be.PRESIDENT:Let me ask you this, to be quite candid. Isthere any way you can use cash?EHRLICHMAN:I don't think so. HALDEMAN:I don't think so. PRESIDENT:As I said, there're a few, not much(unintelligible) as much I think as 200 there&#8482;savailable in '74 campaign n already.HALDEMAN:That compounds the problem. That really does. PRESIDENT:That's what I think. Okay. I'd just like youto know that.EHRLICHMAN:Everybody&#8211;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.103PRESIDENT:Well, I got another thing&#8211;(Pause) Well, I think, well&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) disadvantage and none of theadvantages of, of saying he is a gentlemen. I mean that it, it decidedly links us, in a waythat I don't think you can afford. Ah, the leadthing is sufficiently ambiguous, I think that, that you avoid some of the problem of (unintelligible) direct relationship.HALDEMAN:Uh, no as I say&#8211; ALL TALKING:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:The more I think of the resignation thing, inlight of this, uh, well it's the option (unintelligible)--oh, and the other thing (unintelligible) Ziegler's on (unintelligible) this morning I think (unintelligible)&#8211;HALDEMAN:Tom hasn't been there much&#8211; PRESIDENT:Yeah. And, uh, (tape noise) the difficulty withthe resignation thing is just that it condemnsyou. Nothing could clean up the problem. The idea, as I told your lawyer (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:The continuing analogy of gangrene in the legand then sure (unintelligible) cutting off both arms (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well my point about the resignation,(unintelligible with tape noise) there are some advantages you have to bear in mind that the main advantage being that then I can say, by golly, they're gonna go over this people, put, push Haldeman (unintelligible) John, Ken ColeAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.104PRESIDENT:and yours, Len Garment with Dean's (tape(CONT'D)noise) but with regard to your other 17 may Isay, I think -- well that's good you put down those names. I, I simply not going to, uh, go up and down and do like George Bush here with this fellow, what's his name here --(unintelligible) anybody involved(unintelligible).ALL TALKING:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) working over here anybody overhere and say we&#8482;re going fire somebody. Jesus Christ, Clawson people who've worked in Colson'soffice, the money thing -- so they've gotinvolved in the money, throw out, do you throw out people that, who were just, uh, carrying on, uh, do you throw out somebody (unintelligible) demonstrate. Do you throw outBeginning of Reel 4 Ziegler because he's saying the press officeisn't getting briefed on this thing.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.105HALDEMAN:I don't think that's your problem with Ziegler.I think your problem with Ziegler is that he's lied. END OF REEL 3PRESIDENT:He was lying? HALDEMAN:Sure. See, they're putting it on this whole, onthis Watergate thing. That he's now declaredthe earlier statements inoperative now.EHRLICHMAN:I don't think Ron has never knowingly lied&#8211; PRESIDENT:Never, never. EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:No never.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:No, Ziegler's (unintelligible) is going to beand have to be very straight arrow and I, I was briefed and I asked him, I said, Ron, did every statement you make (unintelligible) Dean report. (Tape Noise,) You're forever making mistakes (unintelligible) best knowledge that I could getat that time. And I think he'll&#8211;HALDEMAN:See, that's why he better stay almost --coveranybody, you've got to cover everybody with the basic truth, which is, that, uhh, the, the gangrene here was Dean. The problem we had is none of us really knew what was happening. I'msure if we did have some peripheral knowledge ofsome things, he did report, he did tell a lie. He (unintelligible). I don't, I don `t (unintelligible). They wondered what he was up to.PRESIDENT:Hope not.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.106EHRLICHMAN:I think that's true. I think he did.HALDEMAN:I don't think that, I think Dean was playing hisown game. I don't think he&#8482;d tell us who knew.PRESIDENT:Dean was playing a game with Mitchell for awhile, but at that point I think he went and told everyone that Mitchell was trying to playthe game there&#8211;HALDEMAN:And, I think if he ever&#8211; PRESIDENT:&#8211;and, remember you all told, you all told meDean's carried a very heavy load and I remember one of my early conversations with him that you've carried a helluva, helluva heavy load andI appreciate what you've done. I've told himthat.HALDEMAN:I was saying that same thing to him in mid-&#8211;March&#8211;PRESIDENT:Correct. HALDEMAN:&#8211;right up til the end of March. PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:Christ sakes, you poor guy, you're doing great.HALDEMAN:And I think at the outset he was doing it. Tookall the right moves; and, and, raking mostly the right acts, but it, it, it compounded itself.EHRLICHMAN:(Tape Noises) (Unintelligible) at least has togive you some feel of the man. (Tape Noises)PRESIDENT:Certainly, we don't have to do it this week.EHRLICHMAN:I, I would say this, that, that, uhh, youwouldn't want to do either of us before you do Dean.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.107PRESIDENT:Oh, I know.EHRLICHMAN:But, uh, (unintelligible). PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) what the conversation(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:That's correct. I can't answer your question.I just don't know. (Tape Noise) Everybody's,uh, I, I, I don't know what the current thinkingis cause I haven't talked to a lot of people around here, but last week everybody was saying, well, you know, we oughta move within 48 hours or it's going to be (unintelligible). Uhh, I don't sense that, I, uhh&#8211;PRESIDENT:Huh, I made one last week too.EHRLICHMAN:You made one last week-end and, uh, everybodyknows very well where you are. And, and from the way the Post and others are kind of treading water at the moment, nothing much is happening.HALDEMAN:Nobody's demanding the President do anythingmore now. What they're demanding now is gettingthe facts out.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Everybody who's guilty should leave,that's what they're saying. Ah, not the guilty&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) his involvement. PRESIDENT:&#8211;it isn't the basic, guilty from the law, theyare, they all separate that.

TO 1:55 P.M.111PRESIDENT:Bob, uh, I think that sounds to me like a, aviable way to approach this at this point, and I think that, I think that, uh, your resignations would not solve anything now. I mean it, it would buy us a good headline for two days.HALDEMAN:No, it would be a bad headline.PRESIDENT:Let me say that-- HALDEMAN:It would be a big headline, but not a good one&#8211; PRESIDENT:Well, it would be a good headline in the termsof, uh, Connally's, uh, view that a bold, uh, stroke, uh, I mean the President's cleaned hishouse and so forth.HALDEMAN:I, I think I disagree.
