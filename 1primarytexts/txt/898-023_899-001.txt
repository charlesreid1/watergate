So I got him to(unintelligible). However, uh, I talkedabout the leaks in the Grand Jury which I of course felt (unintelligible). Mitchell was aware of the fact Dean had put it(unintelligible). I said to Mitchell, Isaid, you should (unintelligible) I just want you to know that you&#8482;re vulnerable onthis point and I don't want this. He said,"Well&#64258;, he said, "I never gave the substance, I always gave an area of how they did it, so forth, so on and so on.&#64258; Hesaid, "After all, it's. it's myresponsibility to do something here in the White House.&#64258; But anyway, I don't know, Ididn't get far with that.

He saysit won't be today--probably, may not betomorrow. -Basically unintelligible) (Pause).They're gonna haul him in court and have himplead guilty and then they're gonna put astatement out because Sirica always questionsthe witnesses who plead guilty. The statementthey're gonna make as broad as they can and asnarrow as they can at the same time. By being broad as they can they&#8482;re going to say that,they're gonna indict, that they're gonna--thathe has named certain people and they're gonnaname a group of people as nonindicted, uh,co-conspirators. Non-indictedco-conspirators.HALDEMAN:Uh, huh. PRESIDENT:They&#8482;re going to include everybody on thatlist. I said, "Is Dean gonna be on that list?&#64258;He said, "Yes". I said, &#64257;Well&#352;&#64257;. He said,uh, he said, "Frankly, somebody needs to bequite candid, that we are--ought not toinclude Haldeman and Ehrlichman on that list.&#64258;Which gives you an option. I said, "Are youtelling me that, if, if Haldeman andEhrlichman, uh, decide to take leave, that, uh, that you, you will not then, uh, proceedwith the, uh, prosecution?"UNIDENTIFIED:And leave them there?APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 3:50 TO 4:35 P.M.4PRESIDENT:"No&#64258;, he said., "I don't mean that.&#64258; Hesaid, "What I mean is that they are notgoing to-appear on that list and-they,they're I mean, that, uh, they will appear before the Grand Jury and make a case thereto determine whether they should beindicted.&#64258; So there's the gun, up ahead.HALDEMAN:(unintelligible) trial (unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:Well, whether we take leave or not doesn'taffect the list that they read off.PRESIDENT:Yes. EHRLICHMAN:Oh, it does?PRESIDENT:Yes.EHRLICHMAN:They will put us on the list if we don'ttake leave?PRESIDENT:That's what he (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Well, the bastard.PRESIDENT:Yes, because otherwise, otherwise, he says,here's what...he says Sirica is going to question Magruder.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...and he's going to question him aboutHaldeman and, uh, it will appear that theywere on a golf course, because 'even thoughhe said it innocently enough (unintelligible) hearsay which Magruder can certainly resolve. And he says he, he doesthat then it will appear that the JusticeDepartment again is covering up the truth--not White House people that did it,but that's where he stands. (Pause). Twoquestions: One, should we go forward with the, uh, with an announcement today or not, or shall I, uhAPRIL 17, 1973, FROM 3:50 TO 4:35 P.M.5EHRLICHMAN:Well, from your standpoint, you must--PRESIDENT:I just don't know how to'r6spond. (Noise)EHRLICHMAN:Even so. I, I think this thing will getaway from you otherwise.PRESIDENT:Well, the real question, I suppose, John, isthis I, I&#8482;m I'm now, I'm really concernedabout the, the vulnerability. I think the both of you think you can, cans, (unintelligible). I don't --think I don'tthink they can make a case on what's here.I don't think they-can. And, uh-so I--here's the whole point, what I think he&#8482;sreally-saying in effect is that if, ifthere--your names will probably be.on the list. That&#8482;s what they're saying unless, you decide not to, decide that your notgoing to--(Pause)HALDEMAN:It isn't just the sentence, we have-toresign. 'Cause the sentence doesn't accomplish anything does it?PRESIDENT:All we have to be sure of is giving Deanimmunity, any token. I&#8482;m, I'm sure the sentence will fit the crime.HALDEMAN:What does he mean from-that? I don'tunderstand.EHRLICHMAN:Well, the guy who gains from that is Dean. HALDEMAN:Yeah, they're putting us in the same bagwith him.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 3:50 TO 4:35 P.M.6PRESIDENT:Now, we got--however, Dean's in thereenough. He said, however, he said, in thepresence of Dean's lawyers, we're cognizantof Dean's going to make, make a case against this Administration. God damn I if he'llget immunity. They're going to try thisAdministration. That's what he says. So. I guess that's where we stand with Dean. Now on the other hand--(Pause)EHRLICHMAN:Well, it's as broad as it is long as far asI'm concerned, uh, if, if, I'm, if I'm to take leave, you think I should? That has thesame effect...PRESIDENT:As resigning? EHRLICHMAN:...as being.. PRESIDENT:Yeah (unintelligible) (Sound of somethingbeing dragged across the desk) you're takingleave (unintelligible) you couldn't come back (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'll never, yeah, I'll never comeback.PRESIDENT:Of course not. I understand that, John. EHRLICHMAN:Now, on the other hand, if I'm indicted andtake leave, and then I'm acquitted (Noise)I, I could come back.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:But, ya see, to take leave...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...and then not appear on the Magruderlist...PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 3:50 TO 4:35 P.M.7EHRLICHMAN:...is a good confession. It's a confession.PRESIDENT:That's right. That's right. So I thinktheir their domino approach just doesn'twork.HALDEMAN:Well, then you look worse by that than youdo the other way. You're better off to haveus on the list than to have us take leave and not be on the list.EHRLICHMAN:'Cause that looks like you're covering up...PRESIDENT:I think so too.EHRLICHMAN:...something that hasn't come out. PRESIDENT:I think so too.HALDEMAN:If we're going to be on the list, so be it!PRESIDENT:That's right. I think you're right. HALDEMAN:I, I think we're in a terrible(unintelligible) These guys are working in amost bloodthirsty way. They--I just headhow they worked Strachan. They've lied to Strachan. They've told him they had, uh, all this stuff. They've told, they've nottold him what his rights are properly. I'mnot sure his lawyer has gotten it straightened out, but it's, it's really,really something. They're trying to get himto, uh, trying to get him to take a cop-out and they won't make a deal. They won't make deals with, I don't think any of them.PRESIDENT:I told them that they could do anything theywant with other people (unintelligible) on the top people.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 3:50 TO 4:35 P.M.8HALDEMAN:They told Strachan if he covered everythingthat he had, everything he knows, and he,they assured him they already had it anywayPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) that's a tactic. HALDEMAN:He said then you and Strachan have a chanceof getting out because you'll become awitness and not a defendant...PRESIDENT:Yeah, that's right, that's right. HALDEMAN:...but they will not give him immunity.PRESIDENT:Well, that, that is immunity, however.HALDEMAN:Well, unless they-it keeps it-their optionsopen and his closed.PRESIDENT:Right. Strachan' a got this, got apurpose...HALDEMAN:God, I hope so. PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and the bastards, you know, Strachan madethat mistake on the 350...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...called Silbert...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...the next day and said,&#64258;I would like tocorrect that. (Noise) I made a mistake-"They said, "Fine, come up Monday morning andwe'll straighten it out.&#64258; He went up Monday morning and they laughed at him and said, "We're not going to put you before the GrandJury," that's when they kicked himaround--hard.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 3:50 TO 4:35 P.M.9PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah.HALDEMAN:...yesterday morning.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Then today when he went in they said, "Wewill not let you correct your statement onthe 350, you, we&#8482;ve got you on a perjurycount."PRESIDENT:That's not true. HALDEMAN:That's what they told him.EHRLICHMAN:It's certainly not fair.HALDEMAN:Well, it&#8482;s also (unintellgiible). EHRLICHMAN:By the law.PRESIDENT:I think under the law if you go forth andvolunteer somethingEHRLICHMAN:I would sure think so. HALDEMAN:But they wouldn't let him go in. So hedidn't volunteer, but he didn't get called,but he sure did it constructively as far as--PRESIDENT:Well, that's the end of it. Shall we, uh,we get to work on this thing?EHRLICHMAN:Sure. PRESIDENT:In your view, should I just go out and readit?EHRLICHMAN:I think so. Don't try to, don't try to,uh-(15 Second Pause).

They'd say "What the hell is that?&#64258; Several weeks ago I began new inquiries in this matter, as a result of,serious charges--which were reported-,publicly and privately.

PRESIDENT:Period. I'm not going to (unintelligible)nation's history, so forth and so on. Youwant to get somebody (unintelligible).(Reel 1 ends) (Reel 2 begins)APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 3:50 TO 4:35 P.M.19PRESIDENT:I think if he puts that in -there he's.going to have a hell of a tough time,(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:I think if he'll cover the truth PRESIDENT:Yep.HALDEMAN:That's what he's got to do. Answer theirquestions truthfully.PRESIDENT:Why didn't he say, "Sure I'll be a witness."Why didn't he just say that, take theiroffer? Maybe that's what he said. "I'lltake your offer."HALDEMAN:I think that's what we want him to do.PRESIDENT:I think what he should do is Just say, "Idon't have anything to hide. I'll take your offer, "and just make the point that...HALDEMAN:Wo--given that offer, he doesn't have tovolunteer anything. All he has to do isanswer their questions.PRESIDENT:That's right, Bob, he should just take theiroffer. Believe me, we don't have to haveStrachan ah, you know, say, he isn't tryingto hide anything.HALDEMAN:I'd feel fine with his doing that, cause--sohe says some things that are damaging. Infact only slightly damaging, and we've had plenty of damaging things already.PRESIDENT:That is right. Yep. Bob, just tell him totake it. All right? If he says "I'll takeit, but I'm, but I'm going to tell you only the truth", then, ah he -tells the truth.You see, they think it is worse than than itis. They think he is covering up and they Ire wrong. That's really what it gets down to.HALDEMAN:They are trying to confuse him. That's the,what's got him bothered. The poor guy. You see, what's really worried him is that he'sAPRIL 17, 1973, FROM 3:50 TO 4:35 P.M.20HALDEMAN:CONT:covered everything with Dean, every step of theway. Everything he has done, he's talked with Dean about it over the last year and he's scared to death Dean will make up something or take something that is partly right and twist it,which is what Dean is doing, and hang him on it.And I think-what he's got to do is just go with what he believes is correct and hang with it.PRESIDENT:Don't you think we are right in telling the U.S.Attorney, "Fine, you want to name Haldeman and Ehrlichman, fine, then you just--they put you onas non-indictable coconspirators, then they'vegot a case to prove. Now they aren't going to do that unless they, they figure they can prove the case, so that would give them the problem.HALDEMAN:That's the part. PRESIDENT:I think his arq--, his argument is, and I mean,I must say, and I don't know what the hellPetersen is up to. It's hard to know, I'm sorry(unintelligible) the President always looks so much better if people just (unintelligible). I think, on the other hand, it looks like. Let's look at that. I mean, let's look at that, that --HALDEMAN:That makes his case for him. That makes hiscase for him.PRESIDENT:Maybe you're right. I was gonna suggest that wewill get back to you, if we get Rogers over here. And I think in this instance, you and Ehrlichman be with Rogers, and we sit down andtalk about this specifically and let him say --HALDEMAN:I think so. Yes. PRESIDENT:You don't have any other lawyer? HALDEMAN:I think no. PRESIDENT:Would you mind getting him over at five o'clock. HALDEMAN:We're meeting with our lawyer at 4:30, 4:30 to5:30, which is the only time we could get him.Would you want me to get him in at 5:30?APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 3:50 TO 4:35 P.M.21PRESIDENT:Sure, sure, Bob, my time is your time.HALDEMAN:Well, I don't want to screw up your time.PRESIDENT:You're not screwing it.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) We, we've only got this guythe only time he could take us. He&#8482;s takingtime out of a deposition (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I understand. I hope he can learn part ofit by that time...HALDEMAN:Well, we'll give him a quick fill and gethim started on it. That's all we can do nowbut we want, we need to get/him started.PRESIDENT:I guess Garment may resign.RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;HALDEMAN:That would be a very foolish thing for himto do.PRESIDENT:Hmm?HALDEMAN:That would be a very foolish thing for himto do.PRESIDENT:He didn't say that. But I meant, you knowhow strongly he feels. He's wrong. He'swrong, Bob. Look, the point is, just sowe're not throwing you to the wolves with Dean.HALDEMAN:What does that accomplish?PRESIDENT:I don't know what it accomplishes. Exceptthat the President learned the facts and as a result of learning the facts(unintelligible) as a result of learning thefacts. I'd say, "Fellas, you've been charged, yeah, I know that Dean has madesome charges.&#64258; Right?HALDEMAN:Right. There's another way you could do itmaybe. Now John won't buy this, I doubt But another way you can do it...I won't do it ifJohn won't.
