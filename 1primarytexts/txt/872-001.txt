And the point, the point is that Dwight Chapin never hired anybody to operate a sabotage, espionage situation. The fact is that hehired somebody to go out and look (inaudible) theopponents advancing operation. I, he, if this guy saw a chance to be a Dick Tuck type guy and and throw something into their schedule that would screw it up and that was the extent of it and Dwight didn't have any involvement in the day to day dealings with this man.
