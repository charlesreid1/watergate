HALDEMAN:How did it all end up?

He had a good statement.Uh, he said that the, uh, the Grand Juryindictment speaks for itself and that, uh, it's now time to realize that some apologies may be due.HALDEMAN:Fat chance. (Laughs)DEAN:Yeah (Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:We couldn't do that (unintelligible) justremember all the trouble they gave us onthis. We'll have a chance to get back at them one day. How are you doing on your other investigations? Your -- How does this(unintelligible)DEAN:(Unintelligible) end of the, uh -- HALDEMAN:What's happened on the bug? PRESIDENT:hard to find -- on the what?HALDEMAN:The bug.DEAN:The second bug. There was another bug foundin the phone of, uh, the first --PRESIDENT:You don't think it was one left over fromthe previous job?DEAN:We're -- Absolutely not. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)DEAN:The, Bureau, has, uh, checked and re-checkedThe man who checked the phone first said that his first check was thorough and it wasthere in the instrument (clear throat) andthat indeed it had to be planted after...SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.3PRESIDENT:What the hell do you think is involved?What's your guess?DEAN:I think the DNC planted it, quite clearly.PRESIDENT:You think they did it?DEAN:Uh huh. PRESIDENT:Deliberately?DEAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Well, what in the name of Christ did theythink that anybody was -- They really want to believe that we planted that?HALDEMAN:Did they get anything on the fingerprints?DEAN:No latents at all. HALDEMAN:There weren't any?DEAN:Neither on the telephone or on the, uh, onthe bug. The, uh, well, the FBI has unleashed a full blast investigation over at the DNC starting with O'Brien right down.HALDEMAN:(Laughs) Using the same crews now that theyhave nothing to do in Washington.DEAN:The same Washington Field Office as well as... PRESIDENT:What are they doing? Asking them what kindof questions?DEAN:Anything that they can think of because whathappened, O'Brien has charged the Bureauwith failing to, uh, find all the, all thebugs, whenever (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Good, that'll make them mad.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.4DEAN:So, so, Gray is pissed now and his peopleare pissed off. So they're moving in because their reputation's on the line.That's, uh, do you think that's a gooddevelopment?PRESIDENT:I think that's a good development because itmakes it look so God damned phony, doesn'tit? The whole --DEAN:Absolutely. PRESIDENT:Or am I wrong?DEAN:No, no sir. It, it --PRESIDENT:-- looks silly. DEAN:If we can, if we can find that the DNCplanted that, the whole story is going to --the whole -- just will reverse.PRESIDENT:But how will you, how could you possiblyfind it, though?DEAN:Well, there's a way. They're, they'retrying to ascertain who made the bug.PRESIDENT:Oh. DEAN:If they -- It's a custom-made product.PRESIDENT:Oh.DEAN:If they can get back to the man whomanufactured it, then they can find out whohe sold it to, and how it came down throughthe chain.PRESIDENT:Boy, you know, you never know. When thoseguys get after it, they can find it. They --SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.5DEAN:The resources that have been put againstthis whole investigation to date are really incredible. It's truly a, it's truly alarger investigation than was conductedagainst, uh, the after inquiry of the JFK assassination.PRESIDENT:Oh.DEAN:And good statistics supporting thatKleindienst is going to have a --HALDEMAN:Isn't that ridiculous though?DEAN:What is?HALDEMAN:This silly ass damn thing. PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:That kind of resources against --PRESIDENT:Yeah for Christ's sake (unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Who the hell cares? PRESIDENT:Goldwater put it in context, he said "Well,for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybodyelse.&#64258; We know that.DEAN:That was, that was priceless. HALDEMAN:Yeah. I bugged --PRESIDENT:Well, it's true. It happens to be totallytrue.DEAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:We were bugged in '68 on the plane andbugged in '62, uh, even running for Governor. God damnedest thing you ever saw.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.6DEAN:It was a shame that that evidence of thefact that that happened in '68 was never preserved around. I understand that onlythe former Director had that information.HALDEMAN:No, that&#8482;s not true. DEAN:There was direct evidence of it?PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:There's others who have that information. PRESIDENT:Others know it. DEAN:DeLoach?PRESIDENT:DeLoach, right.HALDEMAN:I've got some stuff on it, too, in thebombing halt study. 'Cause it's all --that's why, the, the stuff I've got we don't--PRESIDENT:The difficulty with using it, of course, isthat it reflects on Johnson.DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:He ordered it. If it weren't for that, I'duse it. Is there any way we could use it without reflecting on Johnson? How -- Now,could we say, could we say that theDemocratic National Committee did it? No, the FBI did the bugging though.HALDEMAN:That's the problem.DEAN:Is it going to reflect on Johnson or Humphrey? HALDEMAN:Johnson. Humphrey didn't do it. DEAN:Humphrey didn't do it?PRESIDENT:Oh, hell no.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.7HALDEMAN:He was bugging Humphrey, too. (Laughs)PRESIDENT:Oh, God damn. HALDEMAN:(Laughs)PRESIDENT:Well, on the other hand, maybe, uh -- I'lltell you who to call. I want you to ask Connally. Whatever he thinks, maybe weought to just, just let that one fly. Imean, I don't think he will, I don't think he will (unintelligible) Johnson. (Unintelligible) Also it reflects on theBureau. (Unintelligible)DEAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:They, they, they hate to admit that --HALDEMAN: It's a rough one on them with, with all thisstuff about they don't do Congressmen, and all that...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:sort of stuff (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I -- HALDEMAN:do a presidential (unintelligible) PRESIDENT:It isn't worth it. It isn't worth it. Damnit, it isn't worth -- the hell with it.What is the situation on your, uh, on the, on the little red box? Did they find whatthe hell that, that is? Have they found thebox yet?DEAN:Gray has never had access to the box. He isnow going to pursue the box. I spoke withhim just, just about, uh, oh, thirty minutesago and Pat said, "I don't know about the box. Uh, don't know where it is now. Wenever had an opportunity before, when it wasfirst, uh, released in the press there was a box, to go in." But he decided we have grounds now to go in and find out what it'sall about.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.8HALDEMAN:The last public story was that she handedover to Edward Bennett Williams.UNKNOWN:(Clears throat)DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Perhaps the Bureau ought to go over --(NOISE)HALDEMAN:The Bureau ought to go into Edward BennettWilliams and let's start questioning that son-of-a-bitch. Keep him tied up for a couple of weeks.PRESIDENT:Yeah, I hope they do. They -- The Bureaubetter get over pretty quick and get that red box. We want it cleared up.(Unintelligible)DEAN:That's exactly the way I, I gave it to Gray.I, uh, uh --PRESIDENT:We want it cleared up. We want to get tothe bottom of it. If anybody is guilty overhere we want to know.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) in the news. (Laughs) (Noise) DEAN:Another interesting thing that's developedis, regarding the private litigation we'vegot is, uh, the Stans' libel action was assigned to Judge Richey.PRESIDENT:Oh, Christ.DEAN:Well, now, that's good and bad. Uh, JudgeRichey is not known to be one of the intellects on the bench. That's conceded bymany that he is uh, uh --PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) in his own stupid way he'ssort of, uh --SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.9DEAN:Well, he's been thoroughly candid in hisdealing with people about the case. He's made several entrees, uh, off the bench, to,to, uh, (1) to Kleindienst; (2) to, uh, hisold friend Roemer McPhee, to keep Roemer abreast of what his thinking is. He toldRoemer he thought that Maury ought to file alibel action.PRESIDENT:Did he? DEAN:(Laughs)PRESIDENT:Good.DEAN:Uh -- HALDEMAN:Well, can he deal with that caseconcurrently with the other case?DEAN:Yeah. The, the fact that the, the civilcase came to a halt, that the depositions were halted and he --HALDEMAN:-- opened his calendar for a few days.DEAN:Well, it did that, and more than that. Hehad been talking to Silbert, and Silbert, uh, the U.S. Attorney down here, theAssistant U.S. Attorney was saying, "We aregoing to have a hell of a time drawing these indictments up because of the fact thatthese civil depositions keep coming out andthe Grand Jury's got one eye on this civil case because they don't want to get themselves caught, uh, coming out withindictments and the civil case that islooking differently, so --UNIDENTIFIED:Would you like to take Clark now; sir?HALDEMAN:MacGregor's call?PRESIDENT:Yeah. Go ahead.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.10DEAN:So, based, based on that, uh, uh, whenSilbert had told Richey the, uh -- had a casual encounter -- in fact, uh, it was justin the hall -- Richey, the next thing hedoes is he stops the civil case so Silbert can get the indictment down.(TELEPHONE RINGS)PRESIDENT:Hm. DEAN:So it's, it's, uh -- he's got, he's got theabuse of process suit also.(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Hello. Yes. Yeah. Hello. Well you stillalive? Yeah, yeah. Just sitting here withJohn Dean and he tells me that, uh, thatyou, that you're going to probably be sued or some damn thing.HALDEMAN:Oh, God. (Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Did you put that last bug in? Yeah. Due tothe fact that I (unintelligible). Yeah. Yeah. Good. Good. (unintelligible) (Pause) Yeah. (Pause) Good. (18 secondpause) Sure. (Pause) Well, I'll tell you,uh, just don't let this keep you or your colleagues from concentrating on the biggame. Yeah, that's right. I mean this, uh,this, this thing is just, uh, you know, one of those side issues and a month later everybody looks back and wonders what thehell the shouting was about. Yeah. Yeah.Okay, well, anyway get a good night's sleep. And don't, don't bug anybody without askingme. Okay? Yeah. (23 second pause) Thankyou. Always. Okay. (1 minute, 32 second pause, noise and unintelligible conversation)SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.11DEAN:Three months ago I would have had troublepredicting where we'd be today. I think that I can say that fifty-four days from nowthat, uh, not a thing will come crashingdown to our, our surprise.PRESIDENT:Say what?DEAN:Nothing is going to come crashing down toour surprise, either --PRESIDENT:Well, the whole thing is a can of worms, asyou know. A lot of this stuff went on.And, uh, and, uh, and the people who worked(unintelligible) awfully embarrassing. And, uh, and, the, uh, but the, but the way you,you've handled it, it seems to me, has beenvery skillful, because you -- putting your fingers in the dikes every time that leaks have sprung here and sprung there.(Unintelligible) having people straightenthe (unintelligible). The Grand Jury is dismissed now?DEAN:That is correct. They'll, they will havecompleted and they will let them go, sothere will be no continued investigation prompted by the Grand Jury's inquiry. The,uh, GAO report that was referred over toJustice is on a shelf right now because they have hundreds of violations. They've got violations of McGovern's; they've gotviolations of Humphrey's; they've gotJackson violations, and several hundred Congressional violations. They don't wantto start prosecuting one any more than theywant the other. So that's, uh --PRESIDENT:They damn well not prosecute us unless theyprosecute all the others.DEAN:That's right. That's right. Well, we arereally talking about technical violations that were referred over also.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.12PRESIDENT:Sure. Sure. What about, uh, uh, watchingthe McGovern contributors and all that sort of thing?DEAN:We've got a, we've got a hawk's eye on that.PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:And, uh, uh, he is, he is not in full compliance.PRESIDENT:He isn't?DEAN:No. PRESIDENT:Well, now, he has his three hundredcommittees; have they all reported yet?Have we -- we reported ours.DEAN:Yes we -- Well, we have a couple ofdelinquent state committees out, uh --PRESIDENT:Right, but it's done now.DEAN:If they --PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Have the paper committeesall reported, the three hundred or socommittees he's supposed to have.DEAN:We -- no, they have not. PRESIDENT:Can we say something about that, or have we? DEAN:Well, one of the things that he has notdone, is he has never disclosed the factthat he's got some three hundred committees. This has been a Wall Street Journal piecethat picked it up and carried it and, uh --PRESIDENT:Oh, he has never admitted that publicly?SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.13DEAN:No, he hasn't. And it's quite -- it's a taxsham that he set it up for. And -- It is hard to comprehend why he set up threehundred committees, frankly. Uh, he doesn'tneed that many, he doesn't have that sort of large contributors, where they have todisburse small (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Unless someone's giving nine hundredthousand dollars.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Which could be very possible.HALDEMAN:He may be getting nine hundred thousanddollars from somebody.PRESIDENT:From two or three people. He may have somebig angels. I don't think he is getting a hell of a lot of small money. I don't think so. I don't believe this crap. I mean ifhe -- Have you had your Post Office checkyet?HALDEMAN:That John was going to do. I don't know. (Pause) PRESIDENT:That's an interesting thing to check.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:You know how little those damn things(unintelligible)DEAN:(unintelligible) right. As I see it, now,the only problems that, uh, that we have are, are the human problems and we'll keep a close eye on that.PRESIDENT:Union?DEAN:Human. PRESIDENT:Oh.DEAN:(Unintelligible)SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.14HALDEMAN:People--Human frailties, where people fallapart.DEAN:Human frailties - people getting annoyed andsome finger-pointing and false accusations,and any internal dissension of that nature.PRESIDENT:You mean on this case?DEAN:On this case. Uh, there is some bitternessbetween, for example, the Finance Committee and the Political Committee. They feel that they're taking all the heat, and, and, uh,all the people upstairs are bad people andthey're not being recognized.PRESIDENT:Ridiculous.DEAN:It is -- I mean --PRESIDENT:They're all in it together. DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:They should just, uh, just behave and, and,recognize this, this is, again, this is war.We're getting a few shots and it'll be over, and we'll give them a few shots and it'll be over. Don't worry. I wouldn't want to beon the other side right now. Would you? Iwouldn't want to be in Edward Bennet Williams', Williams' position after thiselection.DEAN:No. No. PRESIDENT:None of these bastards -- DEAN:He, uh, he's done some rather unethicalthings that have come to light already,which in -- again, Richey has brought to our attention.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:He went down -- HALDEMAN:Keep a log on all that.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.15DEAN:Oh, we are, indeed. Yeah.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Because afterwards that's the guy,PRESIDENT:We're going after him.HALDEMAN:That's the guy we've got to ruin. DEAN:He had, he had an ex parte --PRESIDENT:You want to remember, too, he's an attorneyfor the Washington Post.DEAN:I'm well aware of that. PRESIDENT:I think we are going to fix the son-of-a-bitch. Believe me. We are going to. We'vegot to, because he's a bad man.DEAN:Absolutely.PRESIDENT:He misbehaved very badly in the Hoffamatter. Our -- some pretty bad conduct, there, too, but go ahead.DEAN:Well, that's, uh, along that line, uh, oneof the things I've tried to do, is just keepnotes on a lot of the people who are emerging as,PRESIDENT:That's right.DEAN:as less than our friends.PRESIDENT:Great. DEAN:Because this is going to be over some dayand they're -- We shouldn't forget the waythat some of them (unintelligible) --PRESIDENT:I want the most, I want the mostcomprehensive notes on all of those thathave tried to do us in. Because they didn'thave to do it.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.16DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:They didn't have to do it. I mean, if thething had been a clo -- uh, they had a veryclose election everybody on the other sidewould understand this game. But now they are doing this quite deliberately and theyare asking for it and they are going to getit. And this, this -- We, we have not used the power in this first four years, as you know.DEAN:That's true.PRESIDENT:We have never used it. We haven't used theBureau and we haven't used the JusticeDepartment, but things are going to changenow. And they're going to change, and, and they're going to get it right --DEAN:That's an exciting prospect.PRESIDENT:It's got to be done. It's the only thing todo.HALDEMAN:We've got to. PRESIDENT:Oh, oh, well, we've just been, we've beenjust God damn fools. For us to come intothis election campaign and not do anything with regard to the Democratic Senators whoare running, and so forth. They're, they'recrooks, they've been stealing, they've been taking (unintelligible). That's ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. It's not going,going to be that way any more, and, uh --HALDEMAN:Really, it's ironic, you know, because we'vegone to such extremes to do every -- Youknow, you, you and your damn regulationswith --PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:Everybody worries about,SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.17PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:about... PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:not picking up a hotel bill or anything.DEAN:Well, I think, we can, I think, I think wecan be proud of the White House staff. Itreally has...PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s right. DEAN:had no problems of that -- PRESIDENT:Well, that's right.DEAN:And they're looking, this GAO audit that'sgoing on right now, uh, I think that they have got some suspicion, uh, in even acursory investigation, which is not going todiscover anything, that they're going to find something here. I learned today incidentally, that, that, uh, I haven'tconfirmed this because it's -- came from theGO, GAO auditor, investigator who's down here, that he is down here at the Speaker of the House's request, which surprised me.HALDEMAN:Well, God damn the Speaker of the House.Maybe we better put a little heat on him.PRESIDENT:I think so too.HALDEMAN:Because he's got a lot worse problems thanhe's going to find down here.DEAN:That's right. (Pause) HALDEMAN:That's the kind of thing --PRESIDENT:I know, let the police department go.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.18HALDEMAN:That's the kind of thing that, you know, you-- What we really ought to do is call the Speaker and say, "I regret to see youordering GAO down here because of what it'sgoing to cause us to require to do to you."PRESIDENT:Why don't you just have Harlow go see himand tell him that?HALDEMAN:Because he wouldn't do it. PRESIDENT:Hm? HALDEMAN:'Cause he wouldn't do it.PRESIDENT:Harlow wouldn't do it, you mean.HALDEMAN:Harlow would say, &#64257;Mr. Speaker --" PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:I, I suppose the other area we are going tosee some publicity on in the coming weeks because, uh. I think after the, now that the indictments are down, there's going tobe a cresting on that. The whitewash chargeof course, but, uh, I think we can handle that while the civil case is in abeyance. But Patman's hearings, uh, his Banking andCurrency Committee, and we've got to --whether we will be successful or not in turning that off, I don't know. We've got aplan whereby Rothblatt and Bittman, who arecounsel for the five men who were, or actually a total or seven, that were indicted today, are going to go up and visitevery member and say, "If you commencehearings you are going to jeopardize the civil rights of these individuals in theworst way, and they'll never get a fairtrial," and the like, and try to talk to members on, on that level. Uh --SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.19PRESIDENT:Why not ask that they request to be heardby, by the Committee and explain it publicly?DEAN:Publicly, they've planned that. Whatthey're going to say is, "If you do commence with these hearings, we plan to publiclycome up and say what you're doing to therights of individuals.&#64258; Something to that effect.PRESIDENT:As a matter of fact they could even make amotion in court to get the thing dismissed.DEAN:That's another thing we're doing is to, is PRESIDENT:Because these hearings ---DEAN:bring an injunctive action against, uh, theappearance, say --HALDEMAN:Well, going the other way, the dismissal ofthe, of the, of the indictment --PRESIDENT:How about trying to get the criminal cases,criminal charges dismissed on the grounds that there, well, you know --HALDEMAN:The civil rights type stuff.DEAN:Civil rights -- Well that, we're workingagain, we've got somebody approaching the ACLU for these guys, and have them go up andexert some pressure because we just don'twant Stans up there in front of the cameras with Patman and Patman asking all these questions. It's just going to be the wholething, the press going over and over andover again. Uh, one suggestion was that Connally is, is close to Patman and probablyif anybody could talk turkey to Patman, uh,Connally might be able to. Now I don't know if that's, uh, a good idea or not. I don't think he -- don't know if he can. Uh, JerryFord is not really takingSEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.20DEAN: (cont.)an active interest in this matter that, thatis developing, so Stans can go see Jerry Ford and try to brief him and explain to himthe problems he's got. And then the otherthing we are going to do is we're looking at all the campaign reports of every member ofthat Committee because we are convinced thatnone of them have probably totally complied with the law either. And if they want to get into it, if they want to play rough,some day we better say, &#64257;Well, gentlemen, wethink we ought to call to your attention that you haven't complied A, B, C, D, E, andF, and we're not going to hold that a secretif you start talking campaign violations here."PRESIDENT:Uh, what about Ford? Do you think so? Doyou think he can do anything with Patman?Connally can't be sent up there.HALDEMAN:No. PRESIDENT:ConnallyDEAN:I don't think anybody can do anything withPatman. But if, if Ford can get the minority members, uh, together on that one,it's going to be a lot --PRESIDENT:They've got a very weak man in Widnall,unfortunately. Heckler is all right.HALDEMAN:Heckler was great.DEAN:She was great, with, uh --PRESIDENT:That's what I understand, but you see,Windnall -- let's take somebody -- Jerrycould talk to him. Put it down, uh, Jerryshould talk to Windnall and, uh, just brace him, tell him I thought it was (unintelligible) start behaving. Not lethim be the chairman of the Committee in theHouse. That's what you want?SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.21DEAN:That would be very helpful, to get ourminority side at least together on the thing.PRESIDENT:Jerry's really got to lead on this. He'sgot to really lead.HALDEMAN:Jerry should, damn it. This is exactly thething he was talking about, that the reasonthey are staying in is so that they canPRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:run investigations.PRESIDENT:Well, the point is that they ought to raisehell about this, uh, this -- these hearings are jeopardizing the -- I don't know thatthey're, that the, the, the counsel callingon the members of the Committee will do much good. I was, I -- it may be all right but - - I was thinking that they really ought toblunderbuss it in the public arena. Itought to be publicized.DEAN:Right. HALDEM4AN:Good.DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:That's what this is, public relations. DEAN:That's, that's all it is, particularly ifPatman pulls the strings off, uh -- (Pause)That's the last forum that, uh, uh, it looks like it could be a problem where you just have the least control the way it standsright now. Kennedy has also suggested hemay call hearings of his Administrative Practices and Procedure Subcommittee. Uh,as, as this case has been all along, you canspin out horribles that, uh, you, you can conceive of, and so we just don't do that. I stopped doing that about, uh, two monthsago.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.22PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:We just take one at a time and you deal withit based on --PRESIDENT:And you really can't just sit and worryyourself --DEAN:No.PRESIDENT:about it all the time, thinking, "The worstmay happen," but it may not. So you just try to button it up as well as you can and hope for the best. And,DEAN:Well if Bob --PRESIDENT:and remember that basically the damn thingis just one of those unfortunate things and,we're trying to cut our losses.DEAN:Well, certainly that's right and certainlyit had no effect on you. That's the, the good thing.HALDEMAN:It really hasn't.PRESIDENT:It has or hasn't? HALDEMAN:No, it hasn't. It has been kept away fromthe White House almost completely and fromthe President totally. The only tie to theWhite House has been the Colson effort they keep trying to haul in.DEAN:And now, of courseHALDEMAN:That's falling apart. DEAN:The two former White House people, lowlevel, indicted, one consultant and onemember of the Domestic Council staff.That's not very much of a tie.HALDEMN:No.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.23PRESIDENT:Well their names have been alreadymentioned.DEAN:Oh, they've been...PRESIDENT:Voluminous accounts.HALDEMAN:And it's, it's been discounted -- PRESIDENT:You know, they've already been convicted inthe press.DEAN:Absolutely. HALDEMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:God damn it, if they'd been communists you'dhave the Washington Post and the New YorkTimes raising hell about their civil rights.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Or Manson.DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Jesus Christ. If they'd been killers,wouldn't --DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Isn't that true? DEAN:It's absolutely true. PRESIDENT:These poor bastards are -- well they've been-- they've got no way they can ever -- Infact, they ought to move the, uh, move the trial away from the --DEAN:Well, there has been extensive clipping bythe counsel in this case, and I've gone through some of these clippings and it's just phenomenal the, uh...SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.24PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:the amount of coverage this case is getting.They may never get a fair trial, may neverget a fair trial. They may never get a jurythat can convict them or pull it together. And the Post, as you know, has got a, a, areal large team that they've assigned to donothing but this...PRESIDENT:Sure. DEAN:this case. Couldn't believe they put MauryStans' story about his libel suit, which wasjust playing so heavily on the networks last night, and in the evening news, they put itway back on about page eight of the Post...PRESIDENT:Sure. DEAN:and didn't even cover it as a -- in total. PRESIDENT:I expect that. That's all right. We've(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:The Post is ... PRESIDENT:The Post has asked -- it's going to have itsproblems.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)DEAN:The networks, the networks are good withMaury coming back three days in a row and --PRESIDENT:That's right. Right. The main thing is thePost is going to have damnable, damnable problems out of this one. They have a television station.DEAN:That's right, they do.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.25PRESIDENT:And they're going to have to get it renewed.HALDEMAN:They've got a radio station, too. PRESIDENT:Does that come up too? The point is, whendoes it come up?DEAN:I don't know. But the practice of non-licensees filing on top of licensees hascertainly gotten more,...PRESIDENT:That's right. DEAN:more active in the, in the area. PRESIDENT:And it's going to be God damn active here.DEAN:(Laughs)PRESIDENT:Well, the game has to be played awfullyrough. I don't know -- Now, you, you'llfollow through with -- who will over there?Who -- Timmons, or with Ford, or -- How's it going to operate?HALDEMAN:I'll talk to Bill. I think -- Yeah.DEAN:Dick Cook has been working...HALDEMAN orPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)DEAN:on it.HALDEMAN:Cook is the guy.DEAN:Dick has been working on it. PRESIDENT:Maybe Mitchell should --HALDEMAN:Well, maybe Mitchell ought to -- would,could Mitchell do it?PRESIDENT:No.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.26DEAN:I don't really think that would be good.PRESIDENT:No. DEAN:I hate to draw him in.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:I think Maury can talk to Ford if that willdo any good, but it won't have the sameimpact, of course, 'cause he's the onedirectly involved, but I think Maury ought to brief Ford at some point on, on exactly what his whole side of the story is.HALDEMAN:I'll talk to Cook.PRESIDENT:Oh, I -- maybe Ehrlichman should talk tohim. Ehrlichman understands the law, andthe rest, and should say, "Now God damn it,get the hell over with this."HALDEMAN:Is that a good idea? Maybe it is. PRESIDENT:I think maybe that's the thing to do(unintelligible). This is, this is big, bigplay. I'm getting into this. So that he -- he's got to know that it comes from the top.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:That's what he's got to know,...DEAN:Right. PRESIDENT:and if he (unintelligible) and we're notgoing to -- I can't talk to him myself --and that he's got to get at this and screw this thing up while he can, right?DEAN:Well, if we let that slide up there with thePatman Committee, it'd be just, you know,just a tragedy to let Patman have a field day up there.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.27PRESIDENT:What's the first move? When does he callhis wit -- witnesses?DEAN:Well, he, he has not even gotten the vote ofhis Committee; he hasn't convened hisCommittee yet on whether he can call hearings. That's why, come Monday morning,these attorneys are going to arrive, uh, onthe doorstep of the Chairman and try to tell him what he's doing if he proceeds. Uh, one of the members, Garry Brown, uh, wroteKleindienst a letter saying, "If theChairman holds Committee hearings on this, isn't this going to jeopardize your criminalcase?"PRESIDENT:Brown's a smart fellow. He's from, he'sfrom Michigan...DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:and some tie into Ford. He's very, he's avery smart fellow. Good.DEAN:Good lawyer and he's being helpful. He isanxious to help.PRESIDENT:Right, just tell him that, tell, tell, tellEhrlichman to get Brown in and Ford in and then they can all work out something, butthey ought to get off their asses and pushit. No use to let Patman have a free ride here.DEAN:Well, we can, we can keep them well briefedon moves if they'll, if they'll move when weprovide them with the, the strategy. And we will have a raft of depositions going theother way soon. We, will be hauling the,the O'Briens in and the like, and uh, on our abuse of process suit.PRESIDENT:What are you going to ask him?(Unintelligible) questions?SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.28DEAN:No. This fellow, this fellow Rothblatt, whohas started deposing, uh, he's quite a character. He's been getting into the sexlife of some of the members of the DNCand...PRESIDENT:Why? How can -- What's his justification?DEAN:Well, he's working on an entrapment theorythat, uh, uh, they were hiding something or they had secret information, affairs to hide and they, they could, some way, conspire tobring this thing about themselves. It's a,it's a way-out theory that, uh, no one had (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(Laughs)DEAN:Uh, and he, he had scheduled Patricia Harrisand she didn't show up. She went to the beauty parlor instead so he went down to theCourt House and she had, had been directedto show up and then the next day the Judge cut all the depositions off. But he had a host of wild questions, including, you know,where O'Brien got his compensation when hewas Chairman. Not that he knows anything about that, but, uh, it was just aninteresting question he thought he mightwant to ask the, the Chairman under oath.HALDEMAN:That's -- It gives us, the same huntinglicense that it gave them.DEAN:Oh, that's right.HALDEMAN:So we can play the same game they areplaying, but we ought to be able to dobetter at it.PRESIDENT:Well -- HALDEMAN:Are those depositions sealed? DEAN:That's right.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:17 P.M.29HALDEMAN:They are?DEAN:But that argues that, uh, they won't wantthem unsealed. They'll want them unsealedless than we will, and we may be arguing atsome point to get them unsealed.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:I think what's going to happen on the civilcase is the Judge is going to dismiss the pending complaint down there right now. They will then turn around and file a newcomplaint which will be heard, or come backto Richey again. That, uh, that'll probably happen the twentieth, twenty-first, twenty-second. Then, twenty days will run untilany answers will have to be filed and these depositions will be commenced so we're, what, we're eating up an awful lot of time--HALDEMAN:On their side.DEAN:for those next fifty-four days. PRESIDENT:Why will they have to dismiss the present -- DEAN:Uh, probably on, on a dual ground, uh, bothon the substantive ground that they haven'tstated a good cause of action -- that there is an improper class action filed and thatO'Brien indeed doesn't represent any class.Uh, and he'll just dismiss it on the merits. It's not a good complaint. He's already shaved it down to almost nothing on hisoriginal order. They will then have to re-design it into a much narrower action, but the Judge himself can't suggest something tocounsel. But it's -- you've got a good resjudicata argument here. If he dismisses on the merits, uh, that they can't file another suit. They're out of the court totally.SEPTEMBER 15, 1972 FROM 5:27 TO 6:27 P.M.30HALDEMAN:But our suits do still hang?DEAN:Our suits are still -- We have two suitsnow, we have the abuse of process and...HALDEMAN:-- the libel --DEAN:the libel suit. HALDEMAN:We can take depositions on both of those?DEAN:Absolutely.PRESIDENT:Hell yes. HALDEMAN:(Laughs) PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) depositions.DEAN:It's a, it's a glimmer down the road anyway,but, uh --
