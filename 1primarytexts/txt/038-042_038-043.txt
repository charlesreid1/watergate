HALDEMAN ON APRIL 15, 1973FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PMUNIDENTIFIED:Okay, be right there. Okay Buddy.OPERATOR:Yes, please.PRESIDENT:Haldeman, please. OPERATOR:Thank you.HALDEMAN:Hello.OPERATOR:Mr. Haldeman, here you are. PRESIDENT:Hope you're enjoying this lovely day. HALDEMAN:Uh, I'm afraid not. Got to get out and takea look at it. It really looks beautifuloutside.PRESIDENT:Right, you're right, uh, are you working onyour statement?HALDEMAN:Yeah, and I, uh, talked to Bill... PRESIDENT:Yeah, he... HALDEMAN:and haven't been able to reachPRESIDENT:I, I, I've, I got that message from Bill.HALDEMAN:Did you talk to him? PRESIDENT:John Ehrlichman's got it. Apparently hetalked to you or to Bill, I don't knowwhich.HALDEMAN:Rogers. Well, I gave him a, I gave John avery quick rundown, but Bill wanted to thinkabout it...PRESIDENT:Oh.APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM2HALDEMAN:and uh, and, uh, talk some more and I thinkhe has gone out to play golf or something.He doesn't seem to be around now,...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:so he...PRESIDENT:His idea being that...HALDEMAN:will call me later this afternoon. Uh,(clears throat) his view--he he said it really depends on what the.Grand Jury does.He,, in other words, he doesn&#8482;t come onstrongly that we should go up there. Uh, he has some real reservations about whether weshould. I think you got a real problem inthis, in the judicial pro--, proceeding, uh, with possibly prominent people under indictment and all that, and trying to run aCongressional investigation at the sametime. And the problem we've had up to now is the feeling that that nothing has been, is being done. This whole feeling is goingto change and if something is being doneyou'll have to start doing everything and, uh, he said if we can work out some safeguards that Congress would live up to, viacapitulation and all that, maybe we should consider going because people do want things cleared up. Uh, he said, I, I really, Ithink the Committee is handling themselvespoorly and, uh, I, I think that, uh, if the Grand Jury is gonna come out fairly soonwith their indictments, I would stronglyvote the other way. I would hang, hang tight for an offer to go up and speak to theAPRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM3HALDEMAN:Committee in Executive Session,con'tbut I wouldn't go up on camera. He said, Ithink your court room rules, is, is abasically a sound proposition...PRESIDENT:All, alrightHALDEMAN:and that people will see that.PRESIDENT:Uh, huh. Well maybe I'll, I just toldEhrlichman the contrary (laughs) but I can change my mind. Uh, Ehrlichman, uh, hadtalked to Moore and Moore says, "Well, hell,everything is, uh, the shit really hits the fan on this thing here that there is goingto be so much flying around ain't going tomake any difference" because Moore, Moore tends to (unintelligible), good God no.HALDEMAN:I don't think that is necessarily trueeither.PRESIDENT:Moore, I, I think is... HALDEMAN:If that is true then, why go up ontelevision?PRESIDENT:It just makes it worse doesn't it? (Pause)HALDEMAN:So PRESIDENT:His point, I guess, think that Moore's pointis at least have the President beforthcoming. But what does that do? Be forthcoming and let them kill us, uh...APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM4HALDEMAN:That's right, and, and., Roger's view is ifyou (clears throat) at least his preliminaryview and he wanted to think about it somemore, but was that if indictments come down at high levels...PRESIDENT:YesHALDEMAN:then you have been forthcoming. You havesaid all along that you'd cooperate fully with the Grand Jury. Now if you cooperatedwith them, which you said you were doing,and nobody said you weren't, and they produce results, that's what the people areafter. The people's concern is thatnothing--that everybody is just sitting here doing nothing about the Watergate, which is what they think 'cause they haven't seen anyresult out of the Grand Jury...PRESIDENT:Well, we're going to have some. HALDEMAN:and a lot, so uh, and he, he also made thepoint, he said if, if, I said--well if wemay be able to get a. a victory herewithout having to pay the price, in the sense that if we, we agree to go up and, uh,the Grand Jury comes down with theindictments that they'll probably turn off the hearings for a time anyway. Then there'll be no...PRESIDENT:YeahHALDEMAN:trials and that sort of stuff. And, uh.-sowe would have appeared to be forthcoming butwe wouldn't maybe have to go. And he said,"Well, I don't agree with that because," uh,...APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM5PRESIDENT:He said?HALDEMAN:Bill said, "I don't agree with that"PRESIDENT:Uh., huh.HALDEMAN:because he said--they will, he said hethought, he thinks it is inevitable thatthey have to stop the hearings if there areindictments at a high level.PRESIDENT:Right, right. I agree with that. HALDEMAN:He says they can't go on with those hearingswhile...PRESIDENT:Yeah HALDEMAN:while those people are hanging trial-pendingtrial.PRESIDENT:Yeah HALDEMAN:Until they have been tried and sentenced,you cannot go ahead with the hearings.PRESIDENT:Uh, huh.HALDEMAN:Now, on that basis, you don't know how longthat is going to take.PRESIDENT:Klein--Kleindienst, just talked to him. Hesaid it will take four or five years.(Laughs)HALDEMAN:Why in the world does he say that?PRESIDENT:Well, the trials, the ap--, appeals, he, ithas to go to the Supreme Court, shit, you know we're, Mitchell gonnaAPRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM6gonna fight and these other guys, what thehell?HALDEMAN:On that basis, you got the judicial processrunning, who, who are these people. And that's what Bill feels strongly on this.PRESIDENT:Yeah, but what about the other things theywant to get into?HALDEMAN:If they can separate them, that's fine. Butthey are the ones who have said they aretotally tied together.PRESIDENT:Um, huh. Yeah I one thing too about theother things. They, they're going to bedenied some of their principal witnesses. Imean, Mitchell will not testify. He will never go up there, you know,...HALDEMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:before the Committee. And, uh, and, andMagruder. He won't go up.HALDEMAN:Nope. Now you are getting the White Housepeople going up and not the other people.PRESIDENT:Uh, huh.HALDEMAN:Where are you on that? PRESIDENT:Uh, huh.HALDEMAN:And that's just the question, Bill said,don't make a commitment now...PRESIDENT:Um, huh.APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM7HALDEMAN:You may have to meet...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:in October or something, you know, when thisthing runs itself out.PRESIDENT:But he did think we could make the ExecutiveSession commitment?HALDEMAN:Yes, PRESIDENT:Puts us in a good forthcoming position. HALDEMAN:That's, that's his point, that that is your,that's a, a very sound offer to, just asyour offer to cor--, to, uh, uh, work with the Grand Jury was a sound offer thatproduced results. You say, we'll, we'll beperfectly willing to work with the Senate, and, and, uh...PRESIDENT:You indicated to Bill there would beindictments at high level?HALDEMAN:I said there are going to be indictments andit's gonna, it looks as if they are going to be bringing indictments and, and other(unintelligible) up over at the Committee.PRESIDENT:What did he say? HALDEMAN:He didn't say, he didn't react at all, but alittle later he said, "Well, if Mitchell isindicted, or something, you know." I didn't say that, but he did.APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM8PRESIDENT:Okay.HALDEMAN:And, uh,PRESIDENT:Well, you know, in a way--I mean, Ire--reading the Johnson/Witcover piece in the Washington Post, we are so low now wecan't go any lower. Huh?HALDEMAN:Yeah, true. PRESIDENT:What did you think of that? HALDEMAN:I don't know.PRESIDENT:Are they right? Not when they say thatthere's the over riding concern today for Watergate. There will be (laugh) when itcomes out the obstruction and all thatbullshit, but...HALDEMAN:Yeah. They, you can get that out by, Imean, you know, if you get hold of a guy onthe way of the Watergate, and say now if, ifPresident Nixon did the Watergate would you still vote for him and, of course, held say No.PRESIDENT:I wonder if they will use the Gallup Polltomorrow if the.damn thing comes out?HALDEMAN:Well, let's see, I haven't seen the Galluprelease, so I don't know that it went out,but I often don't get it until after it...PRESIDENT:We did have... HALDEMAN:comes out.PRESIDENT:We did have a hard figure on that didn't we?APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM9HALDEMAN:He said it was a hard figure. 60 33.PRESIDENT:(Sighs) Anyway, we are glad to have that.HALDEMAN:So, what does Kleindienst think now? Ishe...PRESIDENT:Well, he's for a special prosecutor.HALDEMAN:So is Bill.PRESIDENT:Bill is? HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Who has he got in mind?HALDEMAN:He didn't have any in mind and I didn't getinto that question with him.PRESIDENT:I've, I've really come to that conclusion,too, John, uh, Bob, I feel...HALDEMAN:Oh, really? PRESIDENT:For a reason. That's, really, this is notto prosecute the case.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:A special prosecutor, to look at theindictments to be sure that the indictments run to everybody that they need to run to...HALDEMAN:I-seePRESIDENT:so that it isn't just the President's men(unintelligible)APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM10HALDEMAN:A review of the, in other words, he is aboveSilbert rather than replacing Silbert?PRESIDENT:Oh no, no. Silbert runs the case and that'sall. But he is just in there for the purpose of examining all this to see thatthe indictments cover everybody.HALDEMAN:Uh, huh. Well that does protect you a lot,because if they don't, if they don't, indict some of us then you got, you got a cover upproblem.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:If you, if you have that guy then...PRESIDENT:then heHALDEMAN:you have a basis... PRESIDENT:then he goes out and says, "I have examinedall of this, and now let's stop all thiscrap. These men are not guilty and theseothers, are now, are not indictable and these are."HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:We are thinking about that. We haven'tdecided it yet. But I, I lean toward it now or, in order to just--we've got to-get intothe proper position there.APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM11HALDEMAN:Well, that would make, make sense, you know,rather than, uh, having, uh, Sneed takeover.PRESIDENT:Yeah, because he's compromised too, that, Ican, I can do things for him in the future,see?HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:I can for anybody, but... HALDEMAN:Yeah, but he is your appointee which is alittle different. (Pause) Although anySpecial Prosecutor is your appointee.PRESIDENT:Yeah. It is a little different if he isoutside the--Get this Wright from Texas,that's the guy I sort of lean to, uh, I mean the Dean of the Texas Law School.HALDEMAN:Yeah, um huh, well, I don't know. There,there, there did, did does (unintelligible)have any reading on timing on indictments?PRESIDENT:No, so... HALDEMAN:Because that is...PRESIDENT:He thinks a lot of the damn stuff may leakthough with Magruder running around, and...HALDEMAN:YeahPRESIDENT:Apparently Strachan told an interestingthing to Ehr-, Ehrlichman which, on Magruder, which makes, makes the point that I'm, I'm, you know that, two weeks agoMagruder talked to Strachan, andAPRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM12tried to get Strachan to concoct with himthe story that he, Strachan, did walk acrossthe street with Magruder and tell him thathe, Magruder, to go forward with the operation.HALDEMAN:Which Strachan claims isn't true apparently.PRESIDENT:No. My point is, my point is, though, that,you don't see, the the, the devastating thing this is to Magruder, to hiscredibility?HALDEMAN:Yeah. Magruder... PRESIDENT:And I said to John, "Why the hell is hetrying to do this?" Because Magruder'sdefense is that he's just doing it because it's pressure from higher up. See?HALDEMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:You see the point?HALDEMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:And Magruder--so I'm not so sure that a hellof a lot of Magruder's stuff, even onMitchell, may be s-open to serious question.Serious question.HALDEMAN:Okay. But, but, but, yeah, on some thingsI*think that is true.PRESIDENT:Some things, I think Mitchell is still init. But, I...HALDEMAN:But I don't see how you can, if, if they...APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM13PRESIDENT:But I mean, for example, anything Magrudersays about you, for example, if he does, uh,you know what I mean. Uh, I, I, I think,Bob, your analysis of Magruder once,that he is a guy that doesn't know the truth., isreally true.HALDEMAN:I really believe that, I... PRESIDENT:And I think he's, he's, now he's lied somuch is he going to lie again, uh, he, uh,and work with his attorneys to get himselfseparated from all this thing, and so forth. I-think Strachan will be m--, will be a Goddamned believable witness when he goes downthere. I really feel he will be.HALDEMAN:He will if he stays to the truth. PRESIDENT:If he just tells the truth.HALDEMAN:Doesn't try to tangle those things up atall.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:Hmm, yep that's (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:But you see Strachan was trying tellingMa--, Magruder, Strachan, I mean, Str--, Magruder was telling Strachan, "Look thisshould be the story that I would like totell.&#64258;HALDEMAN:Yeah, it is kind of ridiculous. Why wouldStrachan agree to that?APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM14PRESIDENT:Well, even though...HALDEMAN:Strachan...PRESIDENT:No, no, no, he, he would then implicateStrachan, but at a very, he that, he's at the same level, too, see, so it won't hurthim.HALDEMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:The point of that would be simply thatStrachan, uh, and, and, and he said Magrudertold him about his family and his concernsand all that, you know...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Made a great plea about how his personalproblems were so serious...HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:and he said, "Please, now, let's go along onthis story."HALDEMAN:Yeah PRESIDENT:So, uh, that's interesting. HALDEMAN:Well, you see Magruder was bouncing aroundin, in desperation, telling all differentkinds of stories to different people.PRESIDENT:That's right. Remember you told me that...HALDEMAN:Trying to tie...PRESIDENT:That's right.APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM15HALDEMAN:Something together and, and I, I think whathappened is he ran that string out andfinally just gave up, realized that wouldn'twork and decided to tell the truth, but in the process he doesn't really know what thetruth is. He has made up so many differentstories, and I can understand that.PRESIDENT:Right HALDEMAN:It's hard for me to remember that, what'strue, having just heard all of these otherpeople&#8482;s stories, it is hard to sort stuff out and, if you start lying yourself.PRESIDENT:Bill may have a point there. That if youget a, you know I've, I've sort of had this, and I don't think Ehrlichman and apparently Moore particularly didn't agree with it,but, uh, but, uh, I said look, if they'vegot a hell of a big fish, that is going to take a lot of the fire out of this damn thing on the cover up and all that sort ofcrap. Uh, good God, if they get their, thePresident's law partner and Attorney General, uh, you know.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:I don't know, do you agree or not? Am I--? HALDEMAN:Yeah. That's what I felt that people are,people want something to be done to explainwhat to them is now a phony looking thing.APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM16PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:This will explain it.PRESIDENT:It will explain that they did it, and, ofcourse, the cover up comes in and they did that too.HALDEMAN:Yep, and it all makes sense, it, it'slogical, believable, because it's true.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:And, and there it is and, and I, I can't, itseems to me that there is at least thestrong possibility, if not probability or certainty, that the public reaction is goingto be, well, thank God that's settled; nowlet's get away from it. Rather than the reaction of, "Oh ho, ho, here is something pretty bad; let's, let's spend...PRESIDENT:YeahHALDEMAN:a lot more time looking into it." PRESIDENT:Yeah. That's right. Well HALDEMAN:Well, I think people want solutions; theydon't want ongoing problems.PRESIDENT:You know it's some of the so-called peoplepolling, and, people don't they say thatthey, that Watergate, didn't you say thatGallup.sai-, uh, well, are that it, it doesn't, it, it, it's a concern, it worries them, and so forth-considered it a caper,and they want the God damned thingexplained.APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM17HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Um, huh.HALDEMAN:They want it explained and they want, theywant to get off of it. To--, there isn't...PRESIDENT:Kleindienst also comes in with the idea thatI should, he thinks, sometime I've got to goout and make a Checker's Speech at 9:00 o'clock at night, some--, I said,...HALDEMAN:Oh, Jesus.PRESIDENT:"Now, Dick, I'm not going to do that."HALDEMAN:Um, huh. I sure do. PRESIDENT:I said, "I'm not going to, I'm not going to.I am not going to elevate it that way. Ifits going to be elevated, if it, let the press elevate it. I&#8482;m gonna say it before, the press. I'll go out in the press roomand, you know."HALDEMAN:Yeah. I, I would, unless there is, I thinkthe, that, there is nothing now that indicates doing that.PRESIDENT:But, but when the shit hits the fan, I mean,I've sh--, I'm, I'm going to have to say it's correct but that shows that our judi--,judicial system is uh, we, uh, we got to be,you know. The Special Prosecutor thing helps in another way that, just gets, gets-one person between me and, uh, the uh,whole thing. You see, the Dean report nowhas been totally discredited and, um, you see.APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM18HALDEMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:(Laughs)HALDEMAN:That's right, and that, I, I think, is adarn good reason for it, especially if it can be done. I, I hadn't thought about it,or understood it at the level you're nowtalking about, and that would seem to me exactly what you are after.PRESIDENT:Not somebody to prosecute Mitchell. I won'thave that. That's...HALDEMAN:That... PRESIDENT:not be done.HALDEMAN:That's, that's the other problem. What doyou say when they indict...PRESIDENT:Well, I, well HALDEMAN:Mitchell, and they don't, and Mitchelldoesn't plead guilty? You obviously can'tsay, I'm sorry.PRESIDENT:Oh well, we will just, uh, we'll just saythat, they, say, I will not comment on thecase. I'm, I'm, well that's, we'll have themen work up a statement. (Laughs)HALDEMAN:Yeah, I won't comment and I have fullconfidence...PRESIDENT:Yeah HALDEMAN:That, that, in the... PRESIDENT:Yes.HALDEMAN:American judicial process.APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM19PRESIDENT:In the process and I...HALDEMAN:It will bring the...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:Guilty parties... PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:to account and...PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:clear the innocent parties. PRESIDENT:He has pled innocent and I think he shouldhave every opportunity to that case. I'm, Idon't know whether I,...HALDEMAN:You could...PRESIDENT:I don't know whether I can say I amconfident in his innocence...HALDEMAN:No, that's what I was just... PRESIDENT:Cause they'll ask that key question.HALDEMAN:going to say, you just, you cannot...PRESIDENT:No, it isn't, it is not, it is not properfor me to comment on that because there has been an indictment. It is not proper for meto comment, except that...HALDEMAN:Then you just...APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM20PRESIDENT:He is a fine man, he is entitled to it and Ithink we should not judge this case until ithas been heard in the judicial process.HALDEMAN:You don't want to get into the position thatHiss's character witnesses got in.PRESIDENT:That's right. I can't do it. I know.HALDEMAN:You can, you can, what you can do is expressyour faith in the system.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:In fact, you know there is a lot to begained from this...PRESIDENT:YeahHALDEMAN:if the God damned system comes out right.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:In... PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:In restoring people's faith in the system,rather than in the jackass...PRESIDENT:Committee... HALDEMAN:uh, kangaroo court.PRESIDENT:Yeah, well, okay. Uh, incidentally, Iwondered if you would talk to, uh to John Ehrlichman, uh, uh, I'll, I will get him butwhen you talk to him...APRIL 15, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 3:44 PM21HALDEMAN:I will be talking to him soon.PRESIDENT:Uh, be sure to tell him that I think, weought to, that Bill's, uh, the way I hearBill's thing spelled out, that I think it makes a hell of a lot of sense. Okay?HALDEMAN:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:Alright. HALDEMAN:Alright.(REEL ENDS)
