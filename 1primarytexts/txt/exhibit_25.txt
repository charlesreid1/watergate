DEAN:(Clears throat)PRESIDENT:See what I mean?DEAN:Are we talking Dean, or are we talking Dean,Ehrlichman and Haldeman?PRESIDENT:Well, I'm talking Dean...DEAN:Dean. PRESIDENT:...at this moment. DEAN:All right.PRESIDENT:Dean at this moment, because you're going tobe, uh, you, you're going to be doing it. I'll have to handle them, also. But, thepoint is, what's your advice that we-- Yousee, the point is, we, we don't have-- I Just, I just got it, I just typed up a couple, Just to have here which I'd bewilling to put out. You know...DEAN:Uh huh. PRESIDENT:in the event that, uh, certain thingsoccurred.DEAN:I understand.PRESIDENT:But you see, put the, uh, the, put, justputting the--you don't want to put any liesinto it. Uh (unintelligible). What's youradvice?APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 h .M.3DEAN:I think, I think it'd be the--good to haveit on hand.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:I would think, to be very honest with you-...PRESIDENT:Have those others, too?DEAN:Have those others, also.PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah. I will. Well as a ratter offact, they both su--, suggested it for themselves.DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:So I got that, uh--I am sorry, Steve, I hitthe wrong bell.DEAN:(Laughs)PRESIDENT:So I've already done that with them. DEAN:All right. PPESIDENT:So they said, "Look, uh, they're ready anytime you want them." I've got that. Now Iwant to get your advice on that, too, So what I would, now what I would think we want to do, we should have it in two differentforms, here. We should have it--and I,should like to discuss with you the forms. It seems to me that your, the form shouldbe, uh, uh, request an immediate indefiniteleave of absence. That'd be one thing. And the other, of course, would be, uh, just a straight resignation.DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:Uh, first, uh, what I would suggest is thatyou sign both. That's what I had in mind.And then we'll talk about after, uh, becauseyou don't know yet what you'reAPRIL 16 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.4PRESIDENT:(CONTINUED):going-- For example, you could go in andplead guilty. You'd have to resign.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:If, on the other hand, you're going in, uh,on a, some other basis, then I think a leaveof absence is thenDEAN:Uh huh. PRESIDEMT:the proper thing to do. DEAN:I would think so.PRESIDENT:And, uh, that's the way I would discuss itwith, uh, with others, too. But if you have any other thoughts, let me know. I'm nottrying to press you on a thing. Just, IJust want to be sure, John, you've got the record, that you're, you're, uh, so that I've done everything that I (clears throat)(unintelligible). Do you agree?DEAN:Uh, I, I think it's a good idea. I franklydo.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:But, uh, I think if you do it for, for one--I think you have problems with others too, Mr. President.PRESIDENT:I already have done that with others.DEAN:Yeah. All right. That's what I've beentrying to advise you that, you know...PRESIDENT:But on theirs, on theirs, on theirs, boththe, uh, uh, pending the, uh--It, it is allpending their appearance, and so forth. Just as it is in yours. Nothing's going tobe said.DEAN:Uh huh.APRIL 16 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.5PRESIDENT:But I've got to have it in hand. You seewhat I mean? I mean, my, my reason, --as I told them--As a matter of fact, after ourtalk last night, I told them I said, "We,I've got to have it in hand so that I can move on this, if, uh, as Petersen is goingto report to me every day." You see?DEAN:Uh huh. PRESIDENT:I said, "Now, Petersen," I said, "if you getthis stuff confirmed," I said, "I need toknow." And he said, "Well, I, uh--" 'cause Iasked him, I asked him specifically, I said, "What, what are you, uh, what, uh, what areyou going to do?" He says, "Well, LaRue isgoing to be today." And, I don't know who else. Strachan's going to be today. There are three today I think. I don't know.Who's the third one?DEAN:I don't know. PRESIDENT:That's right. You're not supposed to.(Laughter).PRESIDENTUh, then, okay.DEAN:What I would like to do is, is to draft upfor you an alternative letter. Put it inboth options and you can just put them infile.PRESIDENT:Uh huh. DEAN:Uh, Just short and, and sweet.PRESIDENT:Uh huh. All right. Fine. I had, I haddictated something myself, on my own, which I just, which is, which is, uh(unintelligible) how this--But you don'thave to. If you can give me a better form, fine. I want you to do it either way. Do you, uh, or do you want to just preparesomething?APRIL 16 1973 FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.6DEAN:I'd like to prepare something.PRESIDENT:Good. All right. Fine. Why don't you takethis? And, uh, take those, just as an...DEAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:...idea, and have something that, uh--I'vegot to see Petersen at, 1:30.DEAN:All right.PRESIDENT:Understand, I don't want it s-- put anythingout, because I don't want to jeopardize your position at, at all. You've got a right to,just as everybody else has, to, to--let'ssay you've been--you've carried a hell of a load here and I--But I just feel that sincewhat you said last night that weave got todo on this and with, uh, Haldeman and Ehrlichman- I have, I have leave of absences from them. Which, however, will not useuntil I get the word from Petersen oncorroboration.DEAN:All right. PRESIDENTwhich he, which he advised himself. Italked to him after I talked to you. Leftabout 11:45. I told the son-of-a-bitch, he doesn't know how hard we work around here.DEAN:And you will have something, uh, uh, withina couple of hours.PRESIDENT:Well I, DEAN:You think just put it in the file?PRESIDENT:I won't be back, I won't be back, uh. Yeah.You, you can, uh, you draft what you want me to--in other words...APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:00 A.M.7DEAN:And if you don't like what I draft, tell meand I will change it in any way...PRESIDENT:Oh, sure, sure.DEAN:...that you want.PRESIDENT:But I can't make a decision... DEAN:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:...of course you see--And, and also, it may,it may depend--Well, put it this way, put it this way, you draft what you, what you want. And we can, uh, if I have any concerns aboutit, I'll give you a ring. You can, uh, bearound, and so forth.DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:And, uh, but, but, you would agree youshould--but nothing should be put out now. Right?DEAN:I would agree. I was, I was thinking aboutthat.PRESIDENT:You see, we've got the problem--today thethird may break. You know, with Magruder, uh, and so forth. And, uh, I'm, uh, I--Youknow what I mean. That's what I wanted torun over with you briefly, as to, you know, to get your feeling again as to how wehandle it, how we--You know, you, you weresaying the President should stay ahe-, one step ahead of this thing. Well, we've got, uh-The point is, the only problem is whatthe hell can I say publicly? Now, here'swhat we've done.DEAN:Well, you see.PRESIDENT:I called in--I got in Kleindienst. Uh,we're--I've been working on it all week.APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.8DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:Actually, I mean I got, as soon as I got theMagruder thing, then I, I got inKleindienst, and, uh, then at four o'clockwe got in, uh, so uh, Petersen. Kleindienst withdrew, uh, and, uh, uh, assignedPetersen. I said, "All right, Henry, Idon't want to talk with Kleindienst anymore about this case. I'm just going to talk to you."DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:"You're in charge. You follow through andyou're going through to get to the bottom ofthis thing and I am going to let the chipsfall where they may." And we covered that all the way down the line. Now, I have to follow him to a certain extent on theprosecution side. On the other hand, on thePR side, I sure as hell am not going to let the Justice Department step out there...DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:...and say, "Look, we dragged the WhiteHouse in here." I've got to step out and do it, John.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Don't you agree? DEAN:That's right. Uh... PRESIDENT:But yet, I don't want to walk out and say,"I--Look, John Dean's resignation has beenaccepted." Jesus Christ, that isn't fair.DEAN:Nor would it be fair to say Ehr--,Ehrlichman and Haldeman's have.PRESIDENT:Yeah. What...APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.9DEAN:You know, I, I've already examined...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) because you see theyhaven't been charged yet. As soon asthey're charged (unintelligible). But seehe's--But in your case, is you haven't been charged with anything yet...DEAN:No, I have not.PRESIDENT:That's my problem, see with it DEAN:Uh. PRESIDENT:All I wanted is to have on--The only reasonI'm doing this is to, uh, because of you,what you said about some, what you said about them, and that's why I'm getting itfrom them, too.DEAN:Well, it's a, there's & chance, uh, uh--Well, there's a chance that today when LaRue goes down that Haldeman and Ehrlichman'sname are going to be right down there beforethe Grand Jury.PRESIDENT:Right. Well, the name will be in, but thepoint is, you don't just throw somebody outbecause of a name lying in court.DEAN:I, I understand. PRESIDENT:You understand. Uh, would you, you couldalso, if you would, here's, uh, and I wouldlike for you to prepare this in a letter that you would have for Ehrlichman and Haldeman. Would you do that, too?DEAN:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:And then I'll give them the form and letthem work out their--something, that'sappropriate. Would you prepare that for me,then?APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.10DEAN:Yes, I will.PRESIDENT:But they told me last night, orally, just asyou did, that, uhDEAN:They stand ready.PRESIDENT:Cover the record. They said, "Look, we willleave in a minute. We'll leave today. Youcan do whatever you want." And I said,"What the hell, we're going to have to wait until we get some evidence." You know what I mean?DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:Which I think you agree with. DEAN:I--That's what I do, and the question istiming, and, uh...PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:Uh... PRESIDENT:Now, let's get Dean's advice as to hole arehandle this now, from, uh, now on. What isyour, what's your advice?DEAN:Well, I would say you should have theletters in hand and then...PRESIDENT:Right.DEAN:...based on what you learn from Petersen,you can make a judgment as to timing. Ithink you're still five stems ahead of whatwill ever emerge publicly. I don't think theyPRESIDENT:They think in twelve hours it may breaksomebody told me the news--the Post's,according to Ziegler, has got something now on this. Magruder talking around andeverything. I don't know.APRIL 1973, PROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.11DEAN:Well, I know, I know what--some of thethings Magruder said .He sat I. that, uh, that the prosecutors had asked him a numberof questions about Ehrlichman and Haldeman.So there 's no, there 's no doubt that Let's going to be out on the, uh,...PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:the street fast also. PRESIDENT:Well, then we ought; to move on that too. DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:That 's my point. You see...DEAN:It 's unfortunate that I, you know, I 'mhoping that 'the ultimate resolution of thisthing, is that: no one has any problems.And that's possible...PRESIDENT:Legally. DEAN:legally.PRESIDENT:That's right. Which I hope is your case,too. In other words, then I say no one, nobody at the White House staff--not you, not Colson, not Ehrlichman, not Haldeman,because God damn it--Let me, let me, let mesummarize this specific point again, because I need to, uh, you know, they, we know therewas no--on the Dean report. Ziegler hasalways said it was oral.DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Right. But you remember when you came in, Iasked You the specific question: "Is anybodyon the White House Staff involved?" You told me "No".DEAN:That's right. And I have no knowledge...APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.12PRESIDENT:You still believe that?DEAN:Yes, sir, I do. PRESIDENT:Yeah. But you did tell me that in theaftermath there were serious problems.DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Right. And, I said, "Well, let's see whatthey are." Right?DEAN:And now you're beginning to see what theyare. They're potential, technical, obstruction of justice problems.PRESIDENT:Sure. But not necessarily.DEAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Well, I talked to Petersen last night and hemade exactly the same point. He says theobstruction was morally wrong. No, not morally. He said, it may not have been morally wrong, and it may not be legallywrong, but he said from the standpoint ofthe Presidency, you can't have it. That's what his point was. So he, he seems to think that this, uh, that the obstruction ofjustice thing is a God-damn hard thing toproveDEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:...to prove in court, which I, I thinkshould be some comfort to you.DEAN:Well, my lawyer tells me that, you know,"Legally, you're in, you're in damn goodshape."PRESIDENT:Is that right? DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Because, uh, you're not...APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.13DEAN:That's right. It's, it's aPRESIDENT:You were simply helping the defendants gettheir fees and their...DEAN:Well...PRESIDENT:Huh? What does he say? DEAN:In that, in that position. I'm merely aconduit. Uh, it's very technical, verytechnical. I am a conduit to other people. That is the problem.PRESIDENT:Uh huh. What was the situation, John?This--The only time I ever heard anydiscussion of, uh, this supporting of the defendants--and I must say I, I guess Ishould have assumed somebody was helpingthem, I must have assumed it, but, uh, and, and I must say people were good in a way, I, I was busy--as when you mentioned to mesome, something, about the, I mean. I thinkthe last time we talked about Hal, uh, Hunt having a problem.DEAN:Well...PRESIDENT':Put that and that was, then we, but that washandled at, by Mitchell. Was that true or what the hell happened?DEAN:That's, that 's--The last time we had arequest was the, was...PRESIDENT:How did it work out? Did you--? DEAN:the Monday, before sentencing.PRESIDENT:He hit you with a, uh, uh...DEAN:No. PRESIDENT:at a dinner or something?APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.14DEAN:No, no. O'Brien, who was one of the lawyerswho was representing the Re-election Committee , was asked by Hunt to meet withhim. He came to me after the meeting andsaid that, "Hunt asked the following message be passed to you." And I said, "Why me?"He said, "I asked Hunt the same question."PRESIDENT:To you, Dean, or to me, the President? DEAN:Asked of me, PRESIDENT:Oh.DEAN:Dean.PRESIDENT:Oh yeah. DEAN:It's the first time I'd ever heard anythinglike this. And he said, uh--PRESIDENT:He had never asked DEAN:No. PRESIDENT:you before.DEAN:No. UhPRESIDENT:Let me tell you. What did you report to meon it, though? I--It was rather fragmentary, as I recall it . You said,DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:"Hunt had a problem,&#64258; and, uh... DEAN:Very fragmentary . I was, I...PRESIDENT:Yeah, but that's not the thing. I, I said,"What, what--John, what's it going to cost to do this?" Uh, that's when I sent you to Camp--and said, "Well, for God's sake, let'ssee where this thing comes out.&#64258;APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.15DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:And you said it'd cost a million dollars. DEAN:I said, "It," you know, tit conceivablycould, and the way this," I said, "If wedon't cut this thing..."PRESIDENT:Exactly.DEAN:Uh, anyway...PRESIDENT:But that's the only conversation we had.Where--How was that handled? Who the hell handled that, that money?DEAN:Uh, well, let me tell you the rest--what, what Hunt said. He said, "You tell Dean that I need seventy-two thousand dollars for my personal expenses, fifty thousand dollars for my legal fees."PRESIDENT:Uh huh. DEAN:"If I don't get it, I'm going to have somethings to say about the seamy things I didat the White House for John Ehrlichman."PRESIDENT:Uh huh. DEAN:All right. I took that to Ehrlichman.Ehrlichman said, uh, "Have you talked toMitchell about it?" I said, "No, I have not." Uh, he said, "Well, will you talk toMitchell?" I said, "Yes, I will." I talkedto Mitchell. I just passed it along to him. And then there was a meeting dozen here a few days later in, in Bob's office with Boband Ehrlichman and Mitchell and myself.And, uh, Ehrlichman said at that time. He said, "Well is that problem with Huntstraightened out?" He said it to me and Isaid, "Well, ask the man who may know: Mitchell." And Mitchell said, "I think that problem is solved."APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.16PRESIDENT:That's all?DEAN:That's all he said. PRESIDENT:In other words, that was done at theMitchell level?DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:But you had knowledge; Haldeman had a lot ofknowledge; and Ehrlichman had knowledge.DEAN:Right. PRESIDENT:And I suppose I did. I mean, I am planningto assume some culpability on that(unintelligible).DEAN:I don't think so. PRESIDENT:Why not?DEAN:Uh...PRESIDENT:I plan to be tough on myself as I am on theother thing, though, I, I must say I didn't really give it a thought at the time becauseI didn't know, uh--DEAN:No one gave it a thought. PRESIDENT:You did. You did. DEAN:No onePRESIDENT:You didn't tell me this about Ehrlichman,for example. When you came in on that day.DEAN:I know.PRESIDENT:You simply said, "Hunt needs this money."And you were using it as an example of the problems ahead.APRIL 16 1973 FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.17DEAN:I, I have tried, uh, all along to make surethat anything I passed to you myself didn't cause you any personal problems.PRESIDENT:John, let me ask you this. Let us supposeif this thing breaks and they ask you, John Dean: "Now, John you were the President'sCounsel. Did you report things to thePresident? What did you report to the President?"DEAN:I, I would, I would refuse to answer anyquestions as to anythingPRESIDENT:No, no, no, no, uh, no--I think you should--Let me ask you this.DEAN:Unless you waive...PRESIDENT:Let me say, on this point, I would, uh,would not waive. You could say, "I reported to the President." Uh, that "The Presidentcalled me in." I mean, "The President hasauthorized me to say-- He called me in, and, uh, and, uh, asked me--"DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:Uh, make that, that before, that when theevent first occurred, you conducted an investigation and passed to the Presidentthe message: "No White House personnel,according to your investigation was involved." You did do that, didn't you?DEAN:I did that through Ehrlichman and Haldeman.PRESIDENT:That's it. You did do that.DEAN:If I'm under oath now. I'm, I'm going tohave to say I did that through Ehrlichmanand Haldeman.APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.18PRESIDENT:No. But I know you did that. I didn't seeyou.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Remember I didn't see you until after theelection.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:But you see--all right. Now, but then yousay, "and then, after the election, the President, when the Accord thing broke, called you in." I think that's when it was,wasn't it?DEAN:No, uh... PRESIDENT:After the McCord thing.DEAN:No. It was before the McCord thing becauseyou remember he told me after the Friday morning that McCord's letter...PRESIDENT:Uh huh.DEAN:You said, "You predicted this, this wasgoing to happen." Because I had, oh, in, in about the sleek, uh, or two weeksPRESIDENT:How did it--Why did I get you in there?What, what triggered me getting you in?DEAN:Well, ale just started, we just startedtalking about this thing, and--PRESIDENT:But I called you in, you and Moore together,didn't I?DEAN:Well... PRESIDENT:for a Dean Report.DEAN:On, uh, on, uh, Wednesday morning...APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.19PRESIDENT:Because, what was--well, I know what wasinvolved. What was involved bras the damned executive privilege and all that crap.DEAN:That's right. It was--The Gray things werepopping, but on thePRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:the Wednesday morning before I askedPRESIDENT:lore had three conversations to myrecollection.DEAN:Oh, sir, I think acre had more than that,but, of course, we'd have, uh, we'd have arecord of that throughPRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:those people. I think we had more thanthat. But the, the one report where I finally--I called Bob...PRESIDENT:(unintelligible) this office, Good.DEAN:Yeah. I called Bob and I said. I said,"Bob", I said. "I don't think the President has all the facts.&#64258;PRESIDENT:That's right. And then you came and sat inthis chair and that's the first time that Irealized the thing.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:And what--And nor the question is: "Well,Mr. Dean, why didn't you tell the President before?" And your answer there isDEAN:I didn't know. That is absolutely correct.PRESIDENT:That's what you told me last time. You see,I don't want you, John, to be in a position, and frankly I don't want theAPRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.20PRESIDENT:(CONTINUED):President to be in a position where one ofhis trusted people had information that hedid keep, kept from him. So I just want...DEAN:I did not know. PRESIDENT:Fine. You did not know. "How did you findout then?" They'll ask. Okay. But you-that's your--but you can handle that.DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:But I, but, but I did ask you and I think, Ithink you should say the President hasauthorized you to say this: "I won't reveal the conversation with the President buthe's--and, uh, he asked me this question. Itold him this, and he, uh, uh, that nobody in the White House was involved. And then, in addition to that, that I, I, uh, to thebest of my ability kept, uh--" I guess--orwhat do you think you ought to handle with the Presidential things?DEAN:Well,PRESIDENT:Maybe you better.DEAN:I, I, I think, the less said about PXESIDENT:All right. Fine.DEAN:I think that's privileged, and I think(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Except, except that if you do this DEAN:I think you say anything you want to sayabout it.PRESIDENT:Right. But I have to say it. Well, let metell you, I am going to handle that properlyand I just want to be sure that it, that it,it jibes with the facts.APRIL 16 1973 FROM 10:00 TO l0:40 A.M.21PRESIDENT(CONTINUED):I can say that you did tell me that nobodyin the White House was involved and I cansay that you then came in, at your request,and said, "I think the President needs to hear more about this case."DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:And it eras that time that I started myinvestigation.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Correct?DEAN:That was the Wednesday before they weresentenced. Now, I can get the date, I don'thave it off the topPRESIDENT:Should you do me this? Get your chronologyof that Wednesday you came in and told me. That would be helpful for me to have.DEAN:That's what I had in mindPRESIDENT:You see, I want to DEAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:You see, I--That's when I became interested.I was--I became frankly interested in thecase and I said, "Now God damn it, I want to find out the score." And I set in motionEhrlichman, Mitchell, and a few of-- notMitchell, but others. Okay.DEAN:Sure. PRESIDENT:One other thing. On the privilege thing, Ithink, uh--Nothing, so that you could besure, that, you know, nothing is privileged that involves wrongdoing...DEAN:That's correct.APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.22PRESIDENT:...on your part or wrongdoing on the part ofanybody else. I, I, I 'm telling; you that now and I want you to s--, when you testify,if you do, to say that the President hastold you that. Would you do that ?DEAN:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:Would you agree with that?DEAN:I do. PRESIDENT:Fine. However, let me say that, uh, withregard to, with regard to what we call theelectronic, uh, stuff that occurred in whatI have now have found is in the leak area, national security area , uh, that I considerprivileged .DEAN:I do, too. PRESIDENT:And I think you should say, for example, onthat--But what I meant is, uh, uh, I would,uh, I think in, in the case of the, of theKraft stuff, what the FBI did, they were both, I find--I've checked it back--there were some done, some done through, uh,private sources. Most of it was donethrough the Bureau after we got going.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Hoover didn't want to do, uh, to do Kraft.But what it involved, John, apparently was this: There were leaks in the NSC. They were in Kraft and other columns. We weretrying to plug the leaks.DEAN:Right. PRESIDENT:And we had that, so we checked it out.Finally, we turned it over to Hoover . Thenwhen the hullabaloo developed we didn't, we just stopped it altogether.APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.23DEAN:I understand.PRESIDENT:And that includes (unintelligible). But inmy, uh, view I consider that privileged.DEAN:I have no intention of raising that in anyPRESIDENT:Have you informed your lawyers about that? DEAN:No.PRESIDENT:I think you should not. Understand, notbecause of cutting anything, except that I do think it's privileged. But it's up to, up to you, I mean, IDEAN:No. I think it is privileged, also.PRESIDENT:Yeah. It's important to know, and this asnecessary to use. We had Hoover do a littlebit, and in control, as Lyndon Johnson(unintelligible) better. Uh, now, your, your guess as when--well, I'll ask Petersen today--when will you be called? PerhapsTuesday, Wednesday, or...DEAN:I would think sometime this week. PRESIDENT:You don't think the thing is likely to breaktoday, then, huh?DEAN:No, I don't.PRESIDENT:I wonder what Ziegler's got. He must have--He seems, he seems to think that something'sgoing to go. He hasn't been in to see me.I'll have to get him in later. But, uh, well, I'll have him make--I'll ask Petersen.DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:Petersen. But don't you agree with me--thatthe President should make the first announcement and not the Justice Department?APRIL 16, 1973, FROM l0:00 TO l0:40 A.M.24DEAN:Yes, I do.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). DEAN:(Unintelligible) on his own staff.PRESIDENT:Uh?DEAN:On his own staff. PRESIDENT:Oh, hell, I'm going to make the announce--ment with regard to Magruder too. God darnit, it's our campaign. I'm not going to have the Justice Department...DEAN:Oh, I see what you mean.PRESIDENT:We triggered this whole thing. You knowwhat I mean?DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Don't you agree?DEAN:Well, if, if, if, if--When the... PRESIDENT:You helped trigger it. DEAN:When history is written, you'll, and you putthe pieces back together, you'll see why ithappened. It's because I triggered it. I, I put everybody's feet to the fire because it just had to stop.PRESIDENT:That's right. And you putDEAN:And I still continue to feel that, uh PRESIDENT:That's right. You put Magruder's feet tothe fire.DEAN:Yes, I did. PRESIDENT:Where did you see Magruder? Uh...APRIL 16 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.25DEAN:I didn't. I sent--In fact, I refused to seehim. That eras one of the problems.PRESIDENT:Oh. And that's why he.DEAN:I started, I talked to him. I, I met withhim in, in one of these outer offices out here at a meeting.PRESIDENT:What got Magruder to talk?DEAN:Uh... PRESIDENT:I would like to take the credit. DEAN:Because, because, well, uh, (laughs) he knewthatPRESIDENT:I thought--I was hoping that you had seenhim, because, uhDEAN:There was--Well, he was, he eras told, hewas told (1) that, you know, there was going to be no chancePRESIDENT:You remember, though, when you made thestatement about, uh, just making a note hereabout drawing the wagons up around the White House. Uh, based uh, basically you thought the primary (unintelligible) --this wastalking about pre...DEAN:Pre... PRESIDENT:knowledge--was all in the Committee. Right?DEAN:That's right. Where it is.PRESIDENT:That's right. But on Magruder, come again.What's the deal, deal there?DEAN:Uh, the, uh, uh, situation there is that heand Mitchell were continuing to talk,continuing to talk about proceeding alongAPRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.26DEAN(CONTINUED):the same course they'd been proceeding to,to lock in their story, but my story did notfit with their story. And I just told themI refused to change, to alter my testimony, other than, than to repeat it just as I knewit.PRESIDENT:When? DEAN:This had to do with a number of meetings inthe Department of Justice.PRESIDENT:Incidentally I heard this (unintelligible),but I, I remember. You told me this. Everybody tells me that you said, Dean said."I will not go to the--I am not going downthere and lie," because you said you, your hand will shake and your emotion--Remember you told me that?DEAN:Yeah. No way I could. I'm incapable of it.PRESIDENT:Fine. Thank God. John, don't ever do it.John, I want you to tell the truth.. That's the thing that you're going to-- I have toldeverybody around here, said, "God damn it,tell the truth." 'Cause all they do, John, is compound it.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:That son-of-a-bitch Hiss would be free todayif he hadn't lied about his espionage. He could have just said he--he didn't even haveto. He could've just said, "I--look, I knewChambers. And, yes, as a young man I was involved with some Communist activities butI broke it off many years ago." AndChambers would have dropped it.DEAN:Well... PRESIDENT:But, the son-of-a-bitch lied and he goes tojail for the lie rather than the crime.APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.27DEAN:Uh...PRESIDENT:So believe me, don't ever lie with thesebastards.DEAN:The, the truth always emerges.PRESIDENT:We know that. DEAN:It always does.PRESIDENT:Also, there is a question of right andwrong, too.DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:What is right and what is wrong.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Perhaps there are gray areas, but you'reright to, to get it out now.DEAN:Uh...PRESIDENT:I'm sure. On Liddy. I wanted to be surethat I, that you recall, on cur conversation. I, uh--You asked me to dosomething. I've left it with Petersen now.He said he'd handle it. Uh, that's the proper placeDEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:You see, when Liddy says he can't talkunless he hears from higher authority-- I am not his higher authority...DEAN:No.PRESIDENT:...it's Mitchell. DEAN:Well, but I think he's looking for theUltimate...PRESIDENT:What do you think he's thinking about?APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.28DEAN:I think he's thinking about the President.PRESIDENT:Clemency? DEAN:He thinks--he has the impression that youand Mitchell probably talk on the telephonedaily about this.PRESIDENT:You know we've never talked about it.DEAN:I understand that.PRESIDENT:I have never talked to Mitchell about this.Oh, except about when, whether we go, uh, the executive privilege thing.DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:He came in and said, "Everybody shouldtestify in executive session." Mitchellsaid that. Except you. Which I think wouldbe--Listen, I think, incidentally, about executive privilege...DEAN:I think, I think, Mr. President, the ErvinhearingsPRESIDENT:The later DEAN:are going to fizzle. PRESIDENT:What?DEAN:I think when the, when, when Petersenfinishes hisPRESIDENT:You don't think we should hold to executiveprivilege anyway do you, John now?DEAN:To hold on executive privilege? PRESIDENT:Yeah. What's your advice on that. Whatshould I do?DEAN:I think, I think if you, if, if there areindictments down there in that courtAPRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.29DEAN(CONTINUED):room, none, none of the individuals shouldgo up and testify. I think the Watergate isjust going to be totally carved out of theErvin hearings.PRESIDENT:Yeah. That's the Watergate, right? Thenthe other stuff is not that important,Segretti and all that?DEAN:Segretti, yeah. PRESIDENT:Um huh.DEAN:That stuff is not that important. They'llprobably--They can have a lot of fun with it, but it's not very meaningful.PRESIDENT:So you think Liddy thought that I wascalling Mitchell. (Unintelligible) Good God Almighty. Well, we covered that last Saturday.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:You were there. DEAN:That's resolved. I think PRESIDENT:Is that enough?DEAN:That's right. Petersen `'ill tell you if itdoesn't, uh...PRESIDENT:You tell me now if it isn't enough.DEAN:No, I think it's enoughPRESIDENT:I'm going to expect you to--After all, you're still the Counsel around here(Laughter) No, but I'm serious. You've gotto advise me and that's the same withHaldeman and Ehrlichman. As longs as you are around here, we've got to, we got tohave it out.APRIL 16 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.30DEAN:Well, I, I want, I want to lay one thingout.PRESIDENT:Uh huh.DEAN:I think there is a mythical belief, uh, I'venot tallied to Bob or John about this--that they don't hare a problem, Mr. President.kind I'm, I'm really not sure you'reconvinced they do. But .I'm telling you, they do.PRESIDENT:A problem?DEAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:There's no question about it. DEAN:No question.PRESIDENT:They are...DEAN:I just wanted... PRPSIDENT:Yeah. Petersen made the point. I said,"Tell me What the facts are." And he says,"The problem is, the problem here is thatthey're going to get splashed. And, he said, "When they get splashed, you've got a problem, Mr. President." Now, but then hegoes on to say, as far as the legal form ofit is concerned, and he covers all three of you here.DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:He said, "It's a very difficult case toprove." Do you agree with that?DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:You see, that's the point. And I would hopeit works. I mean I'm speaking now in personal terms. I...DEAN:It's a, it's a technical case and it's atough case.APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.31PRESIDENT:"It's a tough one to prove." What's he meanby that? IDEAN:Apparently, my, my lawyer said, "Now, I've,I've, I've won cases on this, uh, uh, withtougher facts than you've got, I'll assure you."PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:It would not, it would not be a... PRESIDENT:See, that's their real vulnerability,together.DEAN:It would be, uh...PRESIDENT:Both Ehrlichman and Haldeman are in on theobstruction. And that's the point.DEAN:That's right. I think it'd be a very goodidea if they had counsel.PRESIDENT:I told them, yeah, last night to getlawyers, so I'm one step ahead of you there.Now, do you--is there anything else youthink I should do? You don't think I should--Shit, I'm not going to let the Justice Department break this case, John.DEAN:I understand. You've got to break it. Youare breaking it, in a sense.PRESIDENT:Well, God damn it, that's that we've done.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:I could haste told you to go to Camp Davidand concoct a story, couldn't I?DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:And you've never heard that said, have you?APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.32DEAN:No sir.PRESIDENT:In fact, I think I told what Ehrlichman he'dagreed to. But on the other hand, it wasyour job to tell me, wasn't it?DEAN:Un huh. PRESIDENT:And you have. Basically what you've done--No, you, you've told me the truth, though.You've told me the truth. It as your job to work for the White House, the President, the White House Staff, and they were notinvolved in the pre- thing. Put then youthought about the post thing. You thought about it and that's why you decided to--Yousaid, "Cut it out."DEAN:That's why I think... PRESIFT:Right DEAN:...the cancer's growing, because youPRESIDENT:Right.DEAN:t-, t-, t- to keep this whole thing in. PRESIDENT:Look, one thin I rant to be sure is in here,when you testify, I don't want you to be ina position, so, and I don't want thePresident to be in a position that his counsel did not level with him. See mypoint?DEAN:No sir, there's no point that I have notleveled with you as you know.PRESIDENT:No, what I mean is when you say, &#64258;Well, nowMr. Dean," I am speaking now...DEAN:They will, they will not ask(unintelligible)APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.33PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) "Why didn't, why didn't youtell the President? Did you know about this? Why didn't you tell the President?"DEAN:That's a PR situation, Mr. President. TheU.S. Attorneys are not going to ask me question as...PRESIDENT:I see.DEAN:...to what I said to the President or what Ididn't.PRESIDENT:Well, I favor, I frankly think--I would, Iwould hope you could help on the PR there byDEAN:Be expecting to help on it ... PRESIDENT:I would like for you to say, and you're freeto talk about it. You're to say, "I toldthe President about this. I told thePresident first there was no involvement in the White House. Afterwards, I told thePresident that, uh, that I--And thePresident said do "Look, I want to get to the bottom of this thing, period." See what I'm driving at--not just the "White House.You continued your investigation and soforth. The President went ahead, investigated in his own way, which I havedone.DEAN:Uh huh. PRESIDENT:Believe me. I put a little pressure on. DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:...Magruder and a few of these clowns And,uh, "As a result of the President's action, this thing has been broken."DEAN:That's right.APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.34PRESIDENT:Because also I put pressure on the JusticeDepartment, I told Kleindienst,&#64258;God damn it, that..."DEAN:No, I think, I think you're in front rightnow and I, and, uh, you can rest assured everything I do will, will keep you as faras...PRESIDENT:No, I don't want that, understand? When Isay, "Don't lie,&#64258; don't lie about me either.DEAN:No, I won't sir. You're--I. I'm notgoing...PRESIDENT:'Cause I, I, I thinly I've done the rightthing. But I want, I want you to do it, Iwant you to do, if, if you feel I've donethe right thing, I want, I think the country is entitled to know it. Because we're talking about the Presidency here.DEAN:This thing, has changed so dramatically, thewhole situation, since I gave you the picture...PRESIDENT:since you sat in that chair.DEAN:In that chair over there, and gave you whatI thought were the circumstances, the potential problems, and the like, you havedone nothing but try to get to the bottom ofthis, this thing, and,PRESIDENT:I think so. DEAN:and, uh, uh.PRESIDENT:Well, I said, "Write a report." But mypurpose was to write a report, as I said, I want the Segretti matter, uh, put theSegretti stuff in, put everything else in.Whether the White House--what was the White House involvement? You know. What do you say? (pause) How about one last thing:Colson. Uh, you don't think that they'regoing to get him into this, huh?APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.35DEAN:I think, I think he has some technicalproblems--post--also. I don't know if hehas any, if uh--to the best of my knowledge,he has no, had, had no advance knowledge of the thing.PRESIDENT:Right. I suppose the key there is Hunt, youknow, the--He was so close to Hunt. I justwant to know about it just for my own benefit, I, as I told you last night, I, I don't want, I don't wantDEAN:Chuck has...PRESIDENT:...to be in a position... DEAN:Chuck has,...PRESIDENT:"What about Chuck Colson?" I want...DEAN:Chuck has sworn up and down to me... PRESIDENT:I must say to you, John Dean, was Colsoninvolved?DEAN:I have no information that he was at all.PRESIDENT:Post? DEAN:Technical problems.PRESIDENT:Those two things you mentioned last night.DEAN:That and, uh, let's face it, there's othertechnical problems, but, you know...PRESIDENT:Hm. Yeah.DEAN:It's, uh, it's, uh, all the obstruction istechnical stuff that mounts up.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well, you take, for example, theclemency stuff. That's solely Mitchell,apparently, and Colson's talk with, uh,APRIL 16 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.36PRESIDENT(CONTINUED):Bittman where he says, "I'll do every-thingI can because as a, as a friend ...DEAN:No, that was with Ehrllchman.PRESIDENT:Huh? DEAN:That was Ehrlichman.PRESIDENT:Ehrlichman with who?DEAN:Ehrllchman and Colson and I sat up there,and Colson presented his story to Ehrlichman...PRESIDENT:I know.DEAN:regarding it and, and then John gave Chuckvery clear instructions on going back andtelling him that it, you know, "Give him theinference he's got clemency but don't give him any commitment."PRESIDENT:No commitment?DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:Now that's all right. But first, if anindividual, if it's no commitment-- I've got a right to sit here-- Take a fellow likeHunt or, uh, or, or a Cuban whose wife issick and something-- that's what clemency's about.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Correct? DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:But, uh, but John specifically said, "Nocommitment," did he? He...DEAN:Yeah.APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.37PRESIDENT:No commitment. Then, then Colson then wenton to, apparentlyDEAN:I don't know how Colson delivered it, uhPRESIDENT:Apparently to Bittman...DEAN:for... PRESIDENT:Bittman. Is that your understanding?DEAN:Yes, but I don't know what his, you know,specific...PRESIDENT:Where did this business of the Christmasthing get out, John? What the hell wasthat?DEAN:Well, that's, a, that's a PRESIDENT:That must have been Mitchell, huh?DEAN:No, that was Chuck, again. I think that, uhPRESIDENT:that they all, that they'd all be out byChristmas?DEAN:No, I think he said something to the effectthat Christmas is the time that clemencygenerally occurs.PRESIDENT:Oh, yeah. DEAN:Uh--PRESIDENT:Well, that doesn't--I, I, I don't think thatis going to hurt him.DEAN:No.PRESIDENT:Do you?DEAN:No. PRESIDENT:"Clemency,&#64258; he says--0ne (unintelligible)He's a friend of Hunt's. I'm just tryingAPRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.38PRESIDENT(CONTINUED):to put the best face on it. If it's thewrong--if it is--I've got to know.DEAN:Well, one, one of the things I think yowlhave to be very careful, and this is why Petersen will be very good, is, if you takea set of facts and let the prosecutors whohave no--they'll be making, making no PR judgments.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:But they'll give you the raw facts as theyrelate to the law, uh, and it's later you've got to decide, you know, what public facewill be put on it. In other words, they'll--If their...PRESIDENT:Oh, I understand. DEAN:It's going to come out in court, you knowPRESIDENT:You can help on that, John.DEAN:Yes, sir. PRESIDENT:You know that... DEAN:Uh, wherever I may be, I'll be available tohelp on that.PRESIDENT:Well, T hope you're right. You think youtestify when? Well, Petersen will decidethat, I guess.DEAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Do you want me to say anything to him aboutit?DEAN:No.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) that (unintelligible)lawyers.APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.39DEAN:Well, I think my lawyers and, and the U.S.Attorney's Office ought to continue to Uncork in...PRESIDENT:Yeah, I'm having him report to me dailynow...DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:which I judge that I should do. And uh, soall that I'll say is, I'm going to tell him that we had a talk today and I went over again the various materials.DEAN:What would be the best thing in the world isif they decide that they've got nothing but technical cases against people at the WhiteHouse and they chuck them all out. That's,uh, not impossible.PRESIDENT:Should I, should I help? DEAN:No, sir.PRESIDENT:Hah, hah. That's what they ought to hear.DEAN:That's right. (Pause) PRESIDENT:It'd be a tough case for them to prove,John.DEAN:Well, they may decide not--I did--not do itand then nothing, none of these things are even released. It could very well happen.PRESIDENT:Well, that's what I want. I mean, I--Understand, the reason I have to have that is in case there's a break tonight I don't want to have to call John Dean in and say,"Look, John, can I have it?" It looks likeI was--What the Christ am I doing, I, I've got to know because I do have some knowledgethat there might be vulnerability. All thatI am saying was this, as you know...APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.40DEAN:(Clears throat)PRESIDENT:...is that I have heard things from the U.S.Attorney, and from John Dean and from my ownpeople that indicate there could be atechnical violation, that there could be, there could be obstru--Under thecircumstances, I feel that it's my duty tohave your resignation in hand. Of course, the President always has a resignation.DEAN:Well, uh...PRESIDENT:How does that sound to you?DEAN:That's right. The, the thing is thephrasing in the letter, uh, is important.PRESIDENT:All right.DEAN:You don't cause anybody, you know, problemswith a fair trial. So that's why I'd like to...PRESIDENT:Good, John. Well, that's right, I mean,that's--understand, those are my dictations, I just (unintelligible)DEAN:I understand.PRESIDENT:Only it's, only it's a form for you. Andyou, you world it out and work it out so that it would be one that could apply to youand then work out the-- and to, uh,Ehrlichman, Haldeman, anybody else.DEAN:Um huh. PRESIDENT:Just a form that I can give anybody,Strachan--No, he's not going.DEAN:Yes, he's gone. USIA. PRESIDENT:Well, that doesn't come to me does it?APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.41DEAN:Well, the whole Executive Branch, is, huh.PRESIDENT:No, well, no, I mean... DEAN:No, it wouldn't come...PRESIDENT:his resignation can be submitted to Keogh.DEAN:That's right, Keogh. PRESIDENT:Well, I'll get his resignation. And I'lltell--I don't mean about-I'll tell thoseguys that he, uhDEAN:I would have--I don't think you ought totell Strachan, I thinkPRESIDENT:No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Tell Keogh heought to ask for the resignation.DEAN:I think Bob ought to do that, though.PRESIDENT:Bob Haldeman?DEAN:Uh huh. PRESIDENT:Good. I'll tell him; I'll tell Bob then toget them. That'll, that'll be Strachan and,uh, Magruder coming up. That'll be it.DEAN:All right, sir. PRESIDENT:All right. That's your, your advice. Oh,also if you do have any random thoughts on,uh, how many more we could do on thepresentation of this thing, sit over in your office and think of it, I mean, as to how tohandle the---DEAN:Well, I want you to... PRESIDENT:So that the President is in front, you knowwhat I mean.APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.42DEAN:I want, I want, I want to give you some,some notes on that, that I think will help.PRESIDENT:Would you do that?DEAN:Yes sir. I will.PRESIDENT:The record. Here's what I've done. Here'swhat I've done, and what you think thePresident ought to do and when-- you seewhat I mean? And then, if He have to use these things--I pray to God we don't, 'cause you guys don't deserve it. You don'tdeserve it.DEAN:Well, at least, the important thing is thatit's not them, it's you.PRESIDENT:No, well, I know, maybe it isn't mepersonally, it's this place.DEAN:Well, it's the Office, and, uh, the campaignoffice as well.PRESIDENT:All right. Remember, be back.DEAN:All right, sir. PRESIDENT:I would, uh, I'd just, just, just hangtightly...DEAN:I couldn't, I couldn't be...PRESIDENT:hang tightly. DEAN:I couldn't be more objective, Mr. President.And, you know, I just have--don't think I'velost my objectivity in this thing at all.PRESIDENT:What? DEAN:I said, don't think I've lost my objectivityat all in this...APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:00 TO 10:40 A.M.43PRESIDENT:Right.DEAN:even though I'm right at the peak on it.All right, sir.PRESIDENT:Good enough.
