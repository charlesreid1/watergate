HALDEMAN, JOHNEHRLICHMAN AND RONALD ZIEGLER, THE OVAL OFFICE, APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20P.M.PRESIDENT:Where did we come out?EHRLICHMAN:Well, we got two things, we got a, a, apress planPRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...but it rests upon some decisions... PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...that you have to make on sort of anaction plan.PRESIDENT:Right, all right.EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, I just finished an hour with Colsonwho came over very concerned and said that he had to see you. That the message that he bad for you that he had to and wanted toexplain at length is why Dean had to bedealt with summarily. Uh, his partner has a tie in with the U.S. Attorney's office and they seem to know what's going on there.Very simply put, I think"his-argument willbe that the City of Washington generally knows that Dean had little or no access toyou. That Haldeman, Colson, and Ehrlichmanhad a lot of access to you.PRESIDENT:True, that's quite right. EHRLICHMAN:That, that...PRESIDENT:Dean was just a messenger.EHRLICHMAN:...knowledge imputed to us is knowledgeimputed to you, and if Dean is(unintelligible) and testifies that heimputed great quantities of knowledge to Er-or passed great quantities of knowledge to us, and is allowed to get away withthat...APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.2PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...that, that will seriously impair thePresidency ultimately. 'Cause it will bevery easy to argue -that all you have to do is read Dean's testimony, uh, look at theprevious relationships -and there she goes!So, he says the key to this is that Dean should not get immunity. Now, that&#8482;s, th, that's what he wants to tell you.PRESIDENT:Well, he told me that, and, uh, I., and Icouldn't agree more.EHRLICHMAN:Now he says you have total and completecontrol over whether Dean gets immunity...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...through Petersen. PRESIDENT:I don't think so.EHRLICHMAN:Now that's what he says, and he would beglad to come in and tell you how to do it, why, and all that stuff.PRESIDENT:I don't want Colson to come in herebecause...EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:I just feel that way. I feel uneasy aboutthat, uh, his ties and everything in there,I mean they, uh...I realize that Dean is the candidate, uh. Dean, of course, let's look at what he has, his threats and so forthabout, uh, (unintelligible) don't want himto go popping off about, about everything else that has taken place, that he's done inthe government, you know, and uh, thebuggin' of the...EHRLICHMAN:Well the question...(Banging heard in background)PRESIDENT:Whether they--APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.3EHRLICHMAN:...the question-is; uh, I suppose which wayhe is liable to do it most, uh...PRESIDENT:Well, first of all, if he gets immunity(unintelligible) he's likely to be, uh, (unintelligible). He&#8482;ll pay just as littleprice as he can.EHRLICHMAN:Well, the price is the, the price that hepaid, the, that the quid-pro-quo for the immunity is to reach one of the three of usor all of us.PRESIDENT:Or all of us, so (unintelligible)--justmentioned (unintelligible) just said Colsonwill not come down to Washington.EHRLICHMAN:And., uh, the President at uh, uh, andColson argues that if he is not given immunity, then he has even more incentive togo light upon his own malfactions, and, and,he will have to clam up and he will have to defend himself.PRESIDENT:Now, when he talked to me I said, uh, "Now Iunderstand you John.&#64258; I said, "I understandthe tactic you know of all three resigning.&#64258; And I said, "all offered to resign." I toldhim that, you understand. I told him thatyou and John had offered to re, uh, resign, and, uh, and so, so he's, he's aware of that.HALDEMAN:Well, have they told him that the price ofhis immunity is that if we resign they'll give him immunity? Do, do they feel thatmakes their case?Or. does he have togive them evidence?PRESIDENT:I don't know. HALDEMAN:He&#8482;s going to have a tough time with that.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) while we here.EHRLICHMAN:Well, to go on.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.4PRESIDENT:All right.EHRLICHMAN:Now, my, my action plan...PRESIDENT:What would your plan be?EHRLICHMAN:My action plan would, would involve, uh... PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, either suspension or firing of Dean inthe course of an explanation, a historical explanation of your reliance on the Dean Report it's apparently unre, it's apparentunreliability.PRESIDENT:But going out, you see, I, the Garment guygot him in today -Garment says the radio is,is gonna get it all so it's all going tocome out anyway, he points out that LaRue, Strachan, etc., etc., etc and that's, of course, with the U.S. Attorney&#8482;s, I mean,what, uh, that's what Petersen's view is, ofcourse.EHRLICHMAN:What's that? The Garment deal? PRESIDENT:That is it all going to come out, it's allcoming out, and Haldeman and Ehrlichman aregoing to resign. He told me that on Sunday. He's told me and I asked him againyesterday. I said, "Now, look it. That'spretty God-damned flimsy, you know.&#64258; He said, "Yes, I'm not talking about legal, uh, exposure. I'm just talking about the factthat as this stuff comes out they're goingto be eaten to pi-, eaten alive. The President -eventually the clamour is goingto be something you cannot stand.&#64258; I said,"Better for them to get leave or something of that sort now?&#64258; And he said, uh, "This is the government, and I, uh, rather, ratherthan to, than to sit there and act later asa result of this tid-bit and that tid-bit and so forth -he lied and I don't lie and soforth. Haldeman against Dean and Haldemanagainst this,APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.5and Ehrlichman against Dean, and Colson, youknow, and all that. Who did all the lying?&#64258;He said, "Definitely they'll say, &#64257;ForChrist sake, Mr. President, uh, can't you, can't you let these fellas...&#64258; Now that&#8482;s,that's my point. That's what he said.EHRLICHMAN:I understand. PRESIDENT:That's argument that'll be made. EHRLICHMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:He said that to Rogers last night, andthat's that, of course, is Garment's argument.EHRLICHMAN:Um hmmm.PRESIDENT:And I guess Rose agrees, it's gotta be Rose,or whatever.. My problem at the present time is I just don't want to have to talk toeach of those, uh, these, uh, sidelinepeople individually, 'cause I, I don't know. I think some Garment came in and was talking about the Ostrow story in the Times.Petersen told me about it last night. Hesaid Ostrow had called. And I told him, I, "That it must have leaked.out of yourplace.&#64258; He said, "No. it didn't.&#64258; Couldit.leaked out of here. Could It have been Garment.HALDEMAN:Could have been, but doesn't, it isn't atall likely.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:It's a Justice problem.PRESIDENT:But you see what you say about Dean, I saidtoo much, all three, uh, that, uh. He supports the Garment plan. He's talked to Garment and Garment has talked to Dean.EHRLICHMAN:Dean, Dean has talked to everybody in thisplace.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.6PRESIDENT:I told him not to talk to him any more. Butyou see Dean Look, let's see, what the hellwhat's he got; uh, what's the hell he havewith regard to the President? He came and talked to me, as you recall, about the needfor $l20,000 for clemencies for us.EHRLICHMAN:I know, I., I., You told me that the otherday, I didn't know that before.HALDEMAN:But so what?PRESIDENT:What?HALDEMAN:So what? PRESIDENT:I said, how, I said, what in the world, Imean, John, I said John you can't continueon this short notice. What's it cost (unintelligible) I sort of laughed and said, "Well I guess you could get that."EHRLICHMAN:Now is he holding that over your head?Saying, uh-PRESIDENT:No., no, no, no, no, I didn't I don't thinkDean would go so far as to get into anyconversation he had with the President evenDean I don't think.HALDEMAN:Well, he can't, he's got, he's got you haveboth executive privilege in conversationwith him, and--PRESIDENT:Executive privilege. Period. HALDEMAN:And this is in relation to the(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Let's just call it, let's just call itexecutive privilege. Period.HALDEMAN:Well (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:But on the other hand you've got to figurethat Dean could put out something with somebody else.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.7HALDEMAN:But you're notPRESIDENT:That's the only thing I can think of thathe&#8482;s told me, but I. I've not got him inyet to ask about this thing he said about you Liddy told you.EHRLICHMAN:Oh well.PRESIDENT:told Petersen and Petersen said(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:There&#8482;ll be one of those a day. I'm sure,from now on.PRESIDENT:Well, that's the point - the point is canwe, can we survive it? Let's face it.EHRLICHMAN:Well--PRESIDENT:Can Haldeman and Ehrlichman survive it. Uh,the point that I&#352;(PRESIDENT and EHRLICHMAN both speakunintelligible)PRESIDENT:Let me say this. I know your attitude is ahell of a lot different from, from that John Dean. I know that as far as you'reconcerned you'll go out and throw yourselveson a God damned sword. I&#8482;m aware of that. And I am trying to think the thing throughwith that, with that in mind, because, Goddamn it, you're, you're the two most valuable members on the staff. I know that. The problem is, you're the two most loyaland the two most honest.HALDEMAN:We don't have to go into that crap. PRESIDENT:You know how I feel about that. It's notcrap it's the truth. The problem we gothere is this. I do not want to be in aAPRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.8position where the God-damned public clamourmakes, as It did with Eisenhower, withAdams, makes it necessary (unintelligible)calls -to have Bob come in one day and-Bob says "Look, Mr. President, because of thepublic -blah blah blah blah blah -I'm goingto leave.&#64258; Now that's the real problem I've got on this God-damned thing, and I don't think that kicking Dean's ass out of here isgoing to do it.EHRLICHMAN:Eh. PRESIDENT:I think -Understand, I'm not ruling outkicking his ass out. But I think you got tofigure what the hell does Dean know. That he did do. What kind of blackmail does he have? You see, then everything apparentlythat I don't know what all he does know(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Let me make a suggestion. PRESIDENT:All right.EHRLICHMAN:You've got, you've got Dean coming in sayingto you, "I've talked to the U.S. Attorney and I've told him a lot of things that I didwrong.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Right. Right EHRLICHMAN:So you put him on leave. He isn't chargedwith anything yet, but he's said that toyou.PRESIDENT:He said -I asked him that and he said I'llgo on leave with Haldeman and Ehrlichman.EHRLICHMAN:Well, he's not in any position to bargainwith you on that. Now, uh, when the time comes that I'm charged with anything wrong...PRESIDENT:Well, you, John, you have been by a U.S.Attorney and by...EHRLICHMAN:All right, all right.PRESIDENT:...Petersen to me. Petersen is not chargingyou legally.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.9EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's what I Mean. See, I, I'm me, Iunderstand the difference.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) charged Dean legally.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. HALDEMAN:That's the difference.EHRLICHMAN:You see legally Dean has broken the law onthe, on the face of his...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...admission to you--PRESIDENT:Petersen has said to me, he says that there,is, uh, that because of this evidence that has come in here that Haldeman andEhrlichman should (unintelligible) now I'mfaced with that damned hard fact. Now, uh, based on that--EHRLICHMAN:Well, that takes me to my next step, whichis-my continuing misgivings about Petersen.And I'm sorry to be put in the position of having to raise this question in the light of his having said that about me becauseit's, it makes it a very doubtful kind of astatement, but--PRESIDENT:How do I feel-about Petersen.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know, but, but, uh, Just from apersonal, selfish standpoint, I would a whole lot rather, that the case were in the control of somebody who would call themright down the middle. That some guy that Iknow has egg on his face from his previous working with Dean. And I know that out ofDean's mouth. Now -HALDEMAN:If you, if you have any doubt about that andwant it from an unbiased source, call Dick Moore and ask him, because there is noquestion that RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;And you have knowledgeof that now too.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.10EHRLICHMAN:Now, I just cannot mat by quietly. If, if Itake a leave and I go out of here - I amgonna very vigorously defend myself. Andone of the first things I am gonna do is sink Petersen.HALDEMAN:The first thing is Dean, the second isPetersen.EHRLICHMAN:Well, Dean sunk himself as far as I'mconcerned, but, but I will not have Petersenleft in a position to make the prosecutorialdecisions, because I just, as sure as I'm sitting here, I, I promise you that he willindict me.PRESIDENT:Oh, will he? EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir, he will, whether there's anyevidence or not. He will indict me becauseit is very much to his interest to do so.PRESIDENT:God damn it, why was he put in charge of thecase?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I wish he hadn&#8482;t. I, I thought it wasan ad interim thing until, you know, uh, uh,uh, on the basis of your conversation with Kleindienst.PRESIDENT:Kleindienst said he would step aside and hedid.EHRLICHMAN:Well, PRESIDENT:So he (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Okay. But, uh--PRESIDENT:...counsel will never give up-- EHRLICHMAN:I just want to, I just want to say to you inthe strongest kind of terms that, that, uh,I will have no choice in this matter.PRESIDENT:That's right.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.11EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, I'll do it by fair means or foul.PRESIDENT:I hope so.HALDEMAN:Well, no because that&#8482;s gonna hurt too,EHRLICHMAN:Well... HALDEMAN:And that's just gonna (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Hell, Bob.HALDEMAN:I didn't get that. Hell. I, I'm notarguing that you shouldn't do it. I'm arguing that we should try to avoid gettingto the push.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, I'd love to avoid it. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I'd love to avoid it.HALDEMAN:That's just one more dagger in the whole Goddamn thing.EHRLICHMAN:I know. I know.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) that the dagger shouldn'thave to be stuck.PRESIDENT:All right. Get me, get me the action plan(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Well, step, step...PRESIDENT:Now, can I ask you to do one, one(unintelligible) silly little(unintelligible)? What in the name of God isgoing to be said about anything (unintelligible) about that, about that packet of papers? How's that end up -thatGray's a liar? Is that what it adds up to(unintelligible)?EHRLICHMAN:He's either a liar or he's an obstructor--one or the other.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.12PRESIDENT:Or both.EHRLICHMAN:Or both.PRESIDENT:Because something given to him.EHRLICHMAN:No question about that. PRESIDENT:You saw.EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. I did. I was standing rightthere.PRESIDENT:Who gave it to him? EHRLICHMAN:John Dean handed it to him in my presence atmy office.PRESIDENT:What did John say? This is a politicallysensitive--EHRLICHMAN:That, &#64257;Here the, here's this material fromHunt's safe.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Did he say it was politically sensitive(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:No, sir. Not in my, uh, not that I canrecall. He just said, "Here--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) heard the word hotpolitical stuff.EHRLICHMAN:I, I told you about a previous conversationwhere it was described to me in those terms.PRESIDENT:By Dean.EHRLICHMAN:I think so. I think so.HALDEMAN:That's precisely what Dean's told me afterthe fact had sprung out.EHRLICHMAN:Hmmmm. See you get that in. So you don'tget immunity.PRESIDENT:Colson thinks that I can order him not togive immunity.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.13EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:And tell him. Then, then he would say,"Well, what are you going to do aboutHaldeman and Ehrlichman?&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:Well (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:What could I say?EHRLICHMAN:What you have to... HALDEMAN:He doesn't have to say that. EHRLICHMAN:...say is nobody...PRESIDENT:Yes, he does.EHRLICHMAN:I think, what you have to say is nobody inthis White House...PRESIDENT:Dean isn't going to say it. I mean-&#352;Petersen--Petersen's the guy that can give immunity.HALDEMAN:Well, tell him not to give us immunityeither.PRESIDENT:How? That's a problem. Now, come on! HALDEMAN:Well, see, it's none of this businesswhether you suspend us or not. That's yourdecision.PRESIDENT:I know it is. I know it is. But the pointis -Let me put it candidly. If I do notsuspend you, he will probably give himimmunity. That's the problem, I think if I (unintelligible) unbearable. If you do take a leave, I think he will--it's very, it'spossible--well, it's possible that, even ifyou do leave--that he would still give Dean immunity.EHRLICHMAN:I agree.PRESIDENT:Because Dean is the, Dean is the guy thathe's got to use for the purpose of making cases.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.14HALDEMAN:Yes, but even Ehrlichnan, which he alreadyadmits he doesn&#8482;t have a case on - Petersenthought he had significance.PRESIDENT:Well, we got in deep. He says that, he saysthat, legally, yes he does, In, in, in thecase of Haldeman, it'll, I discuss -, theStrachan things have been determined from a lot to do with with, uh, with, uh, what Strachan says and what Kalmbach says, youknow, uh, it's a 350 thing and th, that sortof thing.HALDEMAN:Kalmbach has no relation to me on that.EHRLICHMAN:That ah &#338;PRESIDENT:Have you thought when you say before -itgets to the tangential thing out of the way. Have you given any thought to what the lineought to be I, I don't mean a lie but aline, on raising the money for these defendants? Because both of you were aware thatwas going on, you see the,the raising of money you were aware ofit, right?UNIDENTIFIED:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:And you were aware--You see, you can&#8482;t go inand say I didn't know what in hell he wanted the 350 for. You could say, uh&#352;HALDEMAN:No I've given a great deal of thought. I&#8482;vegot what I&#8482;ve written down.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Well, I wonder. I'm not, I'm not, I'm notlook I'm, I'm concerned about the legalthing, Bob, and so forth. Uh, what &#338; You, you say that our purpose was to keep them from talking to the press.EHRLICHMAN:Well, that was my purpose, I, uh, uh - Andbefore I get too far out on that, uh, I want to talk to an attorney and find out what thelaw is - which I have not yet done.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.15PRESIDENT:Right!HALDEMAN:That's just what I want to do too. Uh, thisisPRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:...only a draft.PRESIDENT:That's right. Well, good. The only pointis I, I think it's not only that but, you, you see that involves all of our people.HALDEMAN:That's what, that's what I feel it involvesKalmbach -UNIDENTIFIED:Well. PRESIDENT:And as to what the hell Kalmbach was told.EHRLICHMAN:Mr. President, uh, when, when the...PRESIDENT:I (unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:...truth and fact of this is known, thatbuilding next door is full of people whoknew that money was being raised for thesepeople.PRESIDENT:EOB? EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:Yup.EHRLICHMAN:Just full of them. PRESIDENT:Many who knew, but there were not so manyactors. In other words, there's adifference between actors and novices.EHRLICHMAN:Okay. Well, apparently not, because I'm notan actor, uh--HALDEMAN:Neither am I. The question there is thetestimony, I suppose.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.16PRESIDENT:I said I, I'm not trying to make any caseEHRLICHMAN:No, but I just want you to thinkPRESIDENT:I'm not stating a case.EHRLICHMAN:I want you to think very critically aboutthe difference here between knowledge of thegeneral transactions going on, on the onehand,PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...and being an affirmative actor on theother, because that's-the difference betweenDean and me.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:Now, uh, on this business of whether Deanshould have immunity, I think you have to ask yourself really, the basic question, whether anybody in the White House who doeswrong, ought to get immunity, no matter bowmany other people be implicates. Uh, the--PRESIDENT:Stracban included? EHRLICHMAN:Anybody anybody. I just question whether inthe orderly administration of justice, itlooks right for anybody in the White House to get immunity.PRESIDENT:I could call Petersen in and basically I'mtrying to identify that myself. I've got to get this public statement out by three o'clock &#338;is that right?EHRLICHMAN:Right.HALDEMAN:But if we're not - Well, yes, but if youdon&#8482;t have to.EHRLICHMAN:Now, but look--APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.17PRESIDENT:Well, Garment says we have to(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Well, (unintelligible) Garment said ityesterday, the day before, and the week before that? Garment (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:He had his hands fullHALDEMAN:...every time a crowd goes, so, uh... PRESIDENT:Well, understand, I'm not panicking myself,but they tell me that there, there seems tobe a considerable feeling that, uh, the,uh...EHRLICHMAN:Well, I agree with you, but I think what weshould do...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) LaRue's been called,Strachan's been called, and Dean's, D, Dean might put up a story of the Times. Younever know. You know, named, uh, Haldemanand Ehrlichman...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, but you see it's typical. PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:Dean position now...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:Now&#352;if Dean is treated different from us, hewill go out and say, "I'm a scapegoat forhigher, higher-ups.&#64258;HALDEMAN:That figures 'cause he knows Ostrow becauseOstrow is the guy that covers Justice.PRESIDENT:I seeAnd, uh, uh, Petersen told methat. He told about, uh, conversations with --that the wife of Jurgen apparently sat atsome table with a (unintelligible) libberthey addressed, and the top guy, Rosenblatt, or something like that, at the Post was talking to somebody else on that staff,(unintelligible)APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.18PRESIDENT:"The President ought to get out in front,(CONTINUED):and, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, we, we've got ahell of a lot more than we're we've justheld it back;" Now, they may be bluffing I - would doubt that they are at this point.HALDEMAN:I think they probably have more, but I wouldguess what they have more of is, is, is, in the Committee. I don't think they got much more in the White House, unless, I don'tknow what it could be unless they got Colsonstuff that would be the only area.PRESIDENT:Colson's activities?HALDEMAN:Yeah, that's the only area where you haveany jeopardy in the White House.PRESIDENT:I doubt - Let me say with regard to Colson,John, I think it's very - You could say thatI'm way ahead of them on that, that I've gotthe message on that and that he feels that Dean But, uh, but believe me I've been thinking about that all day yesterday thiswhether, uh, Dean should be given immunity.EHRLICHMAN:Well, the thing that, uh, that specifically- PRESIDENT:The point is, I, I know that it can happen,but I can call Petersen in and say he cannotbe given immunity, but nobody on the White. House staff can be given immunity. And I whether he'll carry that order out is that,that's going to be an indicator that that'sthe Dean has evidence to hold. And then what do I say about Dean. Do I tell himthat he goes?EHRLICHMAN:Well see, the thing that precipitatedColson's coming over is that...PRESIDENT:He was (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:...and he found that No, no, he found thatDean is still here. You see, Dick Howard called Chuck...APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.19PRESIDENT:Uh huh.EHRLICHMAN:...and went through that business of the FBImen sending him Into the arms of Dean.PRESIDENT:That's right. That's right. EHRLICHMAN:So, Colson called and says you've got anaspat your bosom over there.PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:And so, uh, today he checked again,apparently with Howard, and discovered Deanis still here and he called and said, "I'vegot to see you.&#64258; And he came in and he said, "You guys are just out of your minds,&#64258;and said, "I want to see the President.&#64258;And he was just fit to be tied about it, so...PRESIDENT:Colson was?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, because he thinks, having, being(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:But you see if I say, &#64257;Dean, why don't youleave today," why he&#8482;d go out and say, &#64257;Wellthe President&#8482;s covering up for Enrlichmanand Haldeman," all right. There you are. Because he knows what I know. That's whatbe said he would say. I tried to put the Imean, I, I'm trying to look and see where, John - What the hell we are really up against. You said no first it was Liddy whowas the scapegoat, now John Dean is.HALDEMAN:Well, the answer to that is that thePresident, if be says it publicly, is thatthe President is, is not covering up foranybody, and will not tolerate any cover-up.PRESIDENT:But the way he's put it, the way he's put itto me, why, very cute, very cute, as I havesaid, said, &#64257;I'd like for you to give mesome resignations.&#64258; I said, "I'd like toAPRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.20PRESIDENT:"rewrite it so it doesn't (unintelligible)"(CONTINUED):he re-wrote it in a way that says: uh. "Inview of what you have told me that, uh, thatHaldeman and Ehrlichman are willing to resign,and so forth, you know what I mean, de, de,de, de, too, will resign." In other words, he basically put the shoe on the other...HALDEMAN:Shit.PRESIDENT:...which of course is what led me to theconclusion that that's exactly what I thoughthat his attorneys told him to do. If he canget Haldeman and Ehrlichman, that some waygets him, gets him in the picture. (Unintelligible). That's what you have here.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, because then that will be argued back tothe U.S. Attorney, "Well you see, thePresident thought enough of Dean's charges tolet these guys go.&#64258; (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well, I...EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I was trying to indicate to him that both ofyou had indicated a willingness to--in the event&#352;-that--you know what I mean.EHRLICHMAN:And I said, uh, uh, uh, and here's a guy thatcomes in and in effect confesses to you thecommission of crimes.PRESIDENT:And charges you.EHRLICHMAN:And charges us.PRESIDENT:That's right. And I said, "Now wait, thesecharges" -I said, "These charges are not uh--", and you see he also has an alibi in theU.S. Attorney...EHRLICHMAN:Small wonders.PRESIDENT:He was asked that, uh (unintelligible/REMOVED)Assistant Attorney General has said that, uh,the President should act--APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.21EHRLICHMAN:Well, you see my, you see my point and, Uh-PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMANAnd you'd have to obviously, call us whenPRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:As, as--PRESIDENT:Go ahead. Go ahead on the action(unintelligible) - first (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Well, it would involve, it would involveDean's suspension because it would involve arecounting of how you happened to get intothe personal investigation of this by reason of Dean's being unable to reduce his report,his full report to writing for you. Andthat rang a bell, then, and you personally turned to and have spent a great deal of your time in the last several weeks on this,have, uh, seen dramatic progress in theGrand Jury in the last several days. That would be, that would be Step One. Now in addition to that you would say the ErvinCommittee has, uh, come up with, uh, a goodset of ground rules which do provide us with--PRESIDENT:Well, did you work that.out?EHRLICHMAN:Well, uh, you'd say this. I think you'regonna find that they are going to go on television under oath, uh, pretty muchregardless but, the ground rules give you atoe hold. They do provide for Executive Session.PRESIDENT:Is Executive Session considered executiveprivilege?EHRLICHMAN:And they will consider executiveprivilege...PRESIDENT:And they will consider executiveprivilege...Right. And otherwise they will go on television. They, they will go intoopen hearings.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.22EHRLICHMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:But there again executive privilege isreserved.PRESIDENT:Executive privilege is to be reserved, fine.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.HALDEMAN:At this point, the way we're in the soupnow, we can lose nothing by going out (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:I think we may gain. PRESIDENT:That's right, I couldn't agree more. So ifyou can prepare me with at least that, thatmuch, I'll agree. That I can say that today.HALDEMAN:Well, that's a hell of a bomb shell justright there.PRESIDENT:Yes, uh, it is. But that's our knowledge ofit, John. l4'iiat's the rest of it?EHRLICHMAN:That's it. That's all I have for today. Butit gets you into the case gets you leadingit. It notices the progress and the Grand Jury as related to your efforts and itdoesn't say what they are.PRESIDENT:Well, the point is, though, that the storytoday is that, th John Dean is suspended, but, uh and then John Dean is going to beout there blasting the shit--out of uh,saying the President has indicate that, uh, Haldeman and Ehrlichman too might goHALDEMAN:I didn't say that.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.23HALDEMAN:All right. Let me suggest a differentprocess, which is that you instruct, that,that you don'tPRESIDENT:The U.S. Attorney. HALDEMAN:...that you don't suspend John Dean, butthat you instruct John Dean that he is notto come to work any more. He is to stay He is in effect suspended, but not publicly suspended.PRESIDENT:That's right. He'll say, &#64257;What aboutHaldeman and Ehrlichman?HALDEMAN:I would suggest to you that you do the samewith us. And I was going to suggest that Iwas going to request th-, that action -PRESIDENT:Well. HALDEMAN:Anyway, for this reason I am going to startspeaking for myself. John's got to speakfor himself. I have now concluded that my course is that I must put out my story.PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:I must put it out in total and in mywords...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...before I go to the...EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) I don't know about theGrand Jury before I...PRESIDENT:Before you go to the Senate Committee?HALDEMAN:...go to the Senate Committee. Because ifI'm going to have to put it out thereanyway.PRESIDENT:I don't think you're ever going to get tothe Senate Committee. I don't think the Committee Hearings will ever go forward.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.24HALDEMAN:I do. I don't think there is any chance of their not going forward.PRESIDENT:Probably not.HALDEMAN:You think because of legal case and allthat.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)...Senator Ervin(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Okay. That's great if they don't. Thenmaybe I never tell my story. But my view isthat at some point in time I'm going to haveto tell it.PRESIDENT:But you...HALDEMAN:The way I (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:I would reserve, Bob, the right to tell thatstory until you felt you did have to go to the Committee Hearings. See what I mean?or, unless you got...HALDEMAN:Till a partial (unintelligible)... PRESIDENT:...to a point where you were nibbled todeath.HALDEMAN:That's right. Or until a partial chargecomes up. For instance, if the Grand Jury leaks...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...or the Justice people leak the Strachanstuff...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...then, I have, then that forces my hand.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) John? EHRLICHMAN:Well, subject to, uh, an attorney's advice.HALDEMAN:Well, now, that's the next point was goingto say. I will not make this statement until I have cleared...APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.25PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and worked it, worked it out.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Bill said he doesn&#8482;t haveanything to do to (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Well, we've got some leads we're going tostart on today, so...PRESIDENT:Great. HALDEMAN:...we've got that, but I want -My interestis served and, and I will also argue that,that the better off I come out of this, thebetter off you come out of it -vis-a-vis me. In other words, anything I do to my interestis to your interest.PRESIDENT:Let me ask you this, John.(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:What's that?PRESIDENT:You said that you ought to, you ought not tocome for awhile. Uh, on what, what, what, what basis? In other words, I don't, we do this on an oral basis.HALDEMAN:What I'm doing now is requesting you, on anoral basis...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...to not expect me to carry out any dutiesfor awhile...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...because...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:...(unintelligible) perfect this and get itready.PRESIDENT:Where will you do it, at home, or we can doit at the office here.HALDEMAN:I can do it wherever, wherever you want meto.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think it'd be a mis--I ought to doit in the office, but I don&#8482;t--APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.26PRESIDENT:All right.HALDEMAN:I don't think...EHRLICHMAN:If Dean wants it public (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I (unintelligible) Dean backs out of here(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:All right. Let me suggest that--If Deansays, "What about Haldeman and Ehrlichman?&#64258; You just say, "John, I'm talking to you about you.&#64258;PRESIDENT:All right.EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;Now, I'll take care of them in my own way.I'm not going to have you bargaining withme.&#64258;HALDEMAN:I don't think you can... EHRLICHMAN:Well... HALDEMAN:I guess (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I don't know, I don't know how much of abind we&#8482;re in.HALDEMAN:That's easy. I, I'm not saying - I don't --think the President can be in the positionof making a deal With John Dean on anything.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. "I'll go if, if, uh, they go."Supposing I said, "I won't go unless, uh,uh, Henry Kissinger goes!&#64258; Yeah, uh, it'sridiculous. Uh, here - Let me speak to this. I have pretty much unplugged myself of my day-to-day stuff...PRESIDENT:Sure, that's all right.EHRLICHMAN:...because.this, with this kind of thinggoing on you just can't think about anythingelse.PRESIDENT:Oh, of course, it's been a little hard forme to also.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.27EHRLICHMAN:Uh, sure. Now, uh, I have a need to getinto all kinds of recordsPRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...and my date books... PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...and these are volumes and volumes ofcorrespondence...PRESIDENT:Right. Right. EHRLICHMAN:...and stuff. If I couldn't come into theoffice, I probably couldn't prepare adefense.PRESIDENT:What about Dean coming in? Why not him?Why, why, why, why the hell doesn't Deancome into the office (unintelligible)? I don't think I think because, uh, I've told Dean he's to have nothing more to do withthis case.EHRLICHMAN:Well, he's sure not, he's sure not followingout your orders, if that's the case, uh,...PRESIDENT:You see what I mean.EHRLICHMAN:Now, you'd have another problem...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...and I don't know what's been going on inthe last week or so, but I imagine he'scarted stuff out of here by the bale.PRESIDENT:Well, that&#8482;s (unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:I, I just don't know.HALDEMAN:You, you don't know that.EHRLICHMAN:I, I certainly...APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.28HALDEMAN:If you suspend him or, or, uh, tell him toleave in any way, you also gonna move in toget, take, take care of his files.PRESIDENT:Could I say this, John I would say that"Haldeman and Ehrlichman have both requestedthe opportunity to be relieved of theirduties - Uh, I mean their main duties, so that they can concentrate, concentrate on this matter to prepare for their appearancebefore the Grand Jury.&#64258; Could I say that?EHRLICHMAN:It's true. It's true. PRESIDENT:Then, I'd say, "John, uh, I want to relieveyou of all your duties so that you canconcentrate on your appearance before the Grand Jury.EHRLICHMAN:Well...PRESIDENT:Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.EHRLICHMAN:Sure, I, I, I, I don't--if that's... HALDEMAN:Well, the trap you're falling into there. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:...is that you're admitting to Dean that youregard the allegations that he has raised against us as of the same validity as hisown criminal admission to you.EHRLICHMAN:I maybe do, and if that's the case thenthat's what you should say.PRESIDENT:No, no, no.EHRLICHMAN:If it is...PRESIDENT:No. I don't, I don't (unintelligible),there are two different levels.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.28aEHRLICHMAN:Alright. Then, then that's the way it oughtto be put.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:He's brought in a bunch of a bunch of sillygarbage about me which doesn't add up to toa nickel's worth of a law suit. Uh, he'scome in and told you that he's been involved in all kinds of stuff. It seems to me a very different qualitative kind of, uh, uh,of, uh problem. Here again I hate to arguemy case here.PRESIDENT:Whether it's, whether its...EHRLICHMAN:I., I just...PRESIDENT:Whether it's... EHRLICHMAN:I just uh -very awkward. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I., uh, well.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) God-damn it.(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:No, I shouldn't, I uh, I ought to...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) The problem I've got hereis whether I can try myself uh, uh...EHRLICHMAN:Well,PRESIDENT:I, I can (unintelligible) this businessabout the when I said, "Look John, uh," I said, "both Haldeman and Ehrlichman have offered to resign.&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:Well, I offered to resign at your total andsole discretion. You don't have to have a reason.PRESIDENT:That's right, and I said, and I said, "Theyhave all, both said that?' And I said, ".I will certainly, uh, have better consideration&#64258;APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.29EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, and now, there's another matter.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, if this is awkward for you, hell, thebest thing you could do is get rid of me...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...you know, once and for all.PRESIDENT:Yep. EHRLICHMAN:But if it is anything, if it's anythingshort of that...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...then it seems to me that you have to takeinto account the qualitative differences.PRESIDENT:Yep.EHRLICHMAN:And if you don't want to make a formalsuspension of Dean, then the thing to say to him is, "I want you to stay away from theoffice.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;Just don't come around, because I knoweverything that happens in this building isbeing funneled directly to the U.S.Attorney through you, or I have reason to think that, and I cannot have thatsituation.&#64258; (Pause) Now that's, that's theway-I put it. I-don't know what...PRESIDENT:I agree. EHRLICHMAN:...previous commitment to him is, but he'snot being fired, and he's not beingsuspended.PRESIDENT:Right. Right. Right.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.30EHRLICHMAN:He's being directed to stay away from the office.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) you tell him. Because ofthe fact that you are talking to a U.S. Attorney. I don&#8482;t know. If I could put itthat way to him, I might be able to makesome, make some hay.EHRLICHMAN:Now, if PRESIDENT:Bring the U.S. Attorney in. And I'll saydon't give him immunity.EHRLICHMAN:Not just from a public policy standpoint. PRESIDENT:Yep.EHRLICHMAN:Is this, uh. Well--PRESIDENT:And I would say he wouldn't try to becauseI'll tell you what Petersen did tell me, which does say it, it says, when -he said, Isaid, &#64257;What about Dean?", and he said,&#64257;Well., we haven't made a deal with him yet.&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:Um hum.PRESIDENT:I think I told you about this--EHRLICHMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:I said, "Why didn't you make deal?"Andhe said, "Well, uh," he said, and I,"Because he didn't want to (unintelligible)." And I, I said, "What do you mean you let him off?&#64258; &#64257;Well&#64258;, he said,"that's what you do, Mr President." I said,"Well," I said, "you're talking to the Senate for lies." We&#8482;ve had some real goodtalks.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Pretty fresh. And I set down my(unintelligible) Mr. Rogers. Rogers justshook his head and said, "Jesus Christ" hesaid, "I escape them (unintelligible).&#64258; And I said, "All right.&#64258;APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.31EHRLICHMAN:Well...PRESIDENT:Now, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait aminute. Then Petersen, he said, "We&#8482;ve gotto have corroborative testimony.&#64258; So you see what I mean?EHRLICHMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:Uh, before we could get, uh--Let me put itthis way. He realizes that before he could get, try to give Dean immunity, he's got tohave corroborative testimony on the value ofDean's evidence, and that's what he's trying to get at the present time. That's why hewas calling Strachan, Colson, Kalmbach, etal. The purpose of it being, John, to get corroborative evidence that would say, "Well, Dean's evidence is so valuableinsofar as other people are concerned, thatwe can, therefore, give him immunity. Uh, now I'm not a criminal lawyer, but does that make any sense?EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. I, I don't know.PRESIDENT:But you see what his tactic is? EHRLICHMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:So he isn't going to do it simply on thebasis he isn&#8482;t, he isn't giving Dean immunity simply on the basis of what Dean has already said.EHRLICHMAN:I understand. Uh, my my fear here isthat...PRESIDENT:Dean getting immunity?EHRLICHMAN:Uh, Dean getting immunity or anybody in theWhite House getting immunity.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:It is in itself treatable as a cover-up.And obviously if we are put in a position ofdefending ourselves...APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.32PRESIDENT:Right. Right.EHRLICHMAN:...the things that I'm going to have to sayabout Dean...PRESIDENT:Go ahead. EHRLICHMAN:...are: That basically Dean was the soleproprietor of this project;PRESIDENT:Um hum. EHRLICHMAN:And that he reported-to the President, hereported to me only incidentally, and that(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Reported to the President? EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. I would, I would have to say thatbecause...PRESIDENT:When? EHRLICHMAN:Well, I don't know when, uh, but he pointis...PRESIDENT:The problem that you've got there is thatDean--Dean does have a point there which you've got to realize. He didn't see me when he came out to California. He didn'tsee me until the day you said, "I think youought to talk to John Dean.&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:I think that was in March.EHRLICHMAN:All right. PRESIDENT:And (unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:But, but, but the point is that basically hewas in charge of this project.PRESIDENT:He'll say he reports to the Presidentthrough other people.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.33EHRLICHMAN:Well, okay. Then, then you see what you&#8482;vegot there is an imputation. He says then asthat kind of a foundation "I told Ehrlichmanthat Liddy did it.&#64258; What he is saying is that, "I told the President, throughEhrlichman, that Liddy did it.&#64258;HALDEMAN:Which means that it was privileged knowledgeas far as Ehrlichman was concerned and there was nothing that you were required to doabout it anyway.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. But, uh, uh, you see I get, Iget into a very funny defensive positionthen vis-a-vis you and vis-a-vis him, andit's very damned awkward. And I haven't thought it clear through. I don't know where we come out.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah. You see Dean's Dean's littlegame here, as I know, Dean doesn't, doesn't belong here. This staff, uh, for whatever reasons, this staff has been so God damnedgood. I mean, of course he didn't report tome I was a little busy, and I didn't think you, all of you would (unintelligible) tellsyou, but "Let's let Dean handle that andkeep his ankle out of the President's office. If we want the President; we can get him for other reasons too."EHRLICHMAN:Well, I was busyPRESIDENT:But he did. EHRLICHMAN:Well, the case I'm going to make--PRESIDENT:Well, of course, be would then say, "Who thehell did he report to?&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:Well, he in. many cases, to no one. Hejust went ahead and did things.HALDEMAN:That's right.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.34PRESIDENT:Well, the other point Is, the other point isthat they'll say that, uh (unintelligible)reported to the President, and, uh, thefirst time he reported to the President was when, when, when, when, you know when.EHRLICHMAN:Well, statistically, it's interesting. Uh,I, I'm now far enough into my records for last year.PRESIDENT:Did you have five meetings a month?EHRLICHMAN:I. - uh Less than that. And matched againstthat, all the other things I was doing, and substantive things.PRESIDENT:I know. I know.EHRLICHMAN:And the Dean becomes practically the leastof my worries.PRESIDENT:How about you, Bob?HALDEMAN:I haven't any idea. I don't have a one.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Unless that Dean does. PRESIDENT:We'll have to push the button. Dean - Theonly thing he doesn't have is the fact thathe should have come in to see me. Ziegler can talk to him, I guess, and so forth andso on.EHRLICHMAN:And Moore frequently. PRESIDENT:Moore. EHRLICHMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:All right. All right. Moore is, uh,supposed to tell me about it, but I haven't talked to Moore either, have I?EHRLICHMAN:Well, uh, I think, uh, uh, this, this -APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.35PRESIDENT:Dean (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I've got to think this through. I, uh, Ijust don't know where that leads.PRESIDENT:The point that we make, is, uh, is uh, he,uh, White House staff, and John Dean -JohnDean's highly sensitive information aboutthe President. Well, God-damn it, John Dean's highly sensitive information was on only one count. Believe me guys we allknow. Well, th, th, th,.th, th, the crackystuff regarding Bob -uh, uh, Strachan-that&#8482;s, that's just got to be, beworked out. I don't, I don't know how thehell that's going to work out, John, I mean, uh. Bob, did Strachan (unintelligible) this, this idea of -Did Strachan have a, have theplan? And uh, uh, what, uh, what, uh, what,what he says about whether he did have a plan -whether he did show it to you-- remains to be seen.HALDEMAN:He apparently...PRESIDENT:Huh? HALDEMAN:...says he did not (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:All right. The other point is, is whetherStrachan got information. Now that is the stuff, stuff that is clearly identifiable, according to Petersen, as being telephonictaps. Uh, Strachan will probably say, "No,it was not.&#64258; And, uh, so, that's that.HALDEMAN:The interesting thing is--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)...where's there'sdiscrepancy...HALDEMAN:The discrepancy between Strachan andMagruder is because what Strachan got, whichhe said could have been from that, and itturns out it wasn't. It was with something else.PRESIDENT:I know. I just (unintelligible).APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.36HALDEMAN:When they got that, they'll get aninteresting new problem, because Strachanwould say it was, uh, Operation GEMSTONE,not Operation SEDAN CHAIR -and GEMSTONE wasn't Watergate, so that will then uncoverthe fact that there was something else thatthey did. I don't know what it was.PRESIDENT:Was it something else, you mean? HALDEMAN:I gues, 'cause there was an OperationGEMSTONE that Strachan got reports on.PRESIDENT:They tell me that GEMSTONE was used for allthese operations. That was the code wordfor everything.HALDEMAN:Oh. PRESIDENT:GEMSTONE's for everything. HALDEMAN:I though SEDAN CHAIR too was the, was theWatergate.PRESIDENT:Well, I didn't know that. HALDEMAN:Okay. Then if GEMSTONE is-.the total thing,then, then...PRESIDENT:I seeHALDEMAN:...what's--What he got was reported from hadAnd it said confidential sources indicatedthat -It did not clearly.identify.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:According to Strachan, right? PRESIDENT:Right, Right, Right.HALDEMAN:I can't tell you anything else.PRESIDENT:I, uh, just (unintelligible) I want, wantyou to know it's uh, without -I want you toknow everything he told me you know, youknow. I guess we'll see.HALDEMAN:All right.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.37PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) John, I&#8482;m just trying tosee what the options are on Dean--EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:What we turn loose here. EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...this god-damned (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Well, uh, let's go back to the press plan.Maybe that will give us some guidance.PRESIDENT:Right. Right. Right.EHRLICHMAN:If you say in the press plan, "The Presidentgot concerned about this, "the question, "Why didn't he get concerned sooner becausethis has been in the papers for months andmonths?&#64258; Well, "the reason he didn't get concerned sooner is he was resting secure In the belief that he had the whole story.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:All right. Well, wha, what made himinsecure.PRESIDENT:Did I ever, did I ever call Dean in and askhim? The answer is no.EHRLICHMAN:No, but, th, th, the point is that you, youhad, you were resting secure on hisassurances.PRESIDENT:To whom? Go ahead. EHRLICHMAN:Well HALDEMAN:Didn't, didn't you at some point get areport from Dean that nobody in the WhiteHouse was involved?EHRLICHMAN:Didn't we put that out way back in August?HALDEMAN:Yep.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.38PRESIDENT:I mean, I just, uh, they, uh, they put thatout and I said, "Well, that's all I know,now.&#64258; But, uh, it was never in writing.HALDEMAN:No. That's correct. Now that does say... PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) calls, but he never came inorally and told me. I mean, I--HALDEMAN:He did. PRESIDENT:I can see who would jeopardize Dean JohnDean I never saw about this matter. Youbetter check, but I don't think John Deanwas ever seen about this matter until until I saw him, you know, uh, when JohnEhrlichman suggested he better call Dean.EHRLICHMAN:You better check, Bob, back in that periodof time in July, when we were in San Clemente, 'cause my recollection is that hedid come and see you at that time, but wecan check that.PRESIDENT:Oh. EHRLICHMAN:Anyway.PRESIDENT:By himself? No.EHRLICHMAN:Well, by himself or with one of us. PRESIDENT:Yes.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. But in any event...PRESIDENT:He may have come in, but it was a pretty,uh,...EHRLICHMAN:let's follow out.PRESIDENT:I think he got -I hope he did, hope he did.But, uh, then he might have come in sort of the end, and someone said, "Look, here'sJohn Dean, just in from Washington,&#64258; and Isaid, "Thanks for all your hard work.&#64258;(Unintelligible).APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.39EHRLICHMAN:Well, let's follow out this line and seewhere it leads us.PRESIDENT:All right.EHRLICHMAN:The President rested secure in the, in thebelief that his Counsel had investigatedthis and had assured him that nobody in theWhite House was involved. Okay, then what moved him off of that belief and assurance? Well, what moved him off was the sequence ofevents leading to John Dean being sent toCamp David to write it all down.PRESIDENT:What moved him off first were reports thatoccurred in the court testimony.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. All right. PRESIDENT:The charges were made by McCord, and othercharges that were, that, that, that --Thecharges were made by McCord, Uh, I, Iwouldn't say we're taking all sorts of people who were charged under The charges were made by McCord, uh, uh, that, in open,before the Ervin Committee. It's evidentthe President ordered a full press investigation.EHRLICHMAN:Well, uh, the first thing you did and maybeyou can avoid saying this but you're saying you ordered a full press investigation - Uh, when, when Dean came back...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...and said to Bob,... PRESIDENT:I told him (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;I can't write that down.&#64258;PRESIDENT:He told me that too. EHRLICHMAN:Then, I'd write.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.40PRESIDENT:That Dean spoke to me.EHRLICHMAN:I just told you. Then that rang the bell,because if Dean can't write that down, thenwe must have problems bigger than I ever thought we did.PRESIDENT:Sure.EHRLICHMAN:And so that's when you put on the full courtpress. Now,...PRESIDENT:All right. Here's--That'll go against.Fine--That was fine (unintelligible).You've got the dates on this, so don't worry about it. We better get this out.EHRLICHMAN:I have them in there -Yeah.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) The point is, uh, let'ssee, let's see what Dean says to that. He says, "Well, the reason I couldn&#8482;t write itdown was because Dick Moore and others saidthat we, we were all talking and how would we write it down -bring it down to the White House. How do we draw the wagons up aroundthe White House?" That phrase recurs. Youdon't remember--remember that?EHRLICHMAN:Sure. Isn't that a Dean phrase?HALDEMAN:Yep. His line was that, that you could dothat because there was no problem at the White House, and the problems were at the Committee, and Dean...PRESIDENT:Dean.HALDEMAN:his idea was...

EHRLICHMAN:And, and I'm sure that when he went throughthis exercise, it was impossible for him towrite it down without it being a confession. And he said, "My God, I don't know how thiscase is going to break, but I'm crazy tohave a-piece of paper like that around.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Then I could say, then, that I ordered it.Uh, who conducted the investigation for thisarea?EHRLICHMAN:Apparently, the, the way we got it doesn'tsay.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:It didn't say anything.HALDEMAN:You asked the other staff members to explorethis You had Ehrlichman, Moore, Garment,Haldeman.PRESIDENT:That's right.

PRESIDENT:Now, that (unintelligible) indicted(unintelligible) you can&#8482;t kill a person onjust for being indicted. But he has to take leave (unintelligible) case (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:He should be, that is true.PRESIDENT:Well, at any rate-- EHRLICHMAN:How about anyone granted immunity? HALDEMAN:Be dismissed.PRESIDENT:Anyone granted immunity ah, will be ah, letme, let me, try Petersen on you today. Your, your idea about Petersen would be tohit him, promptly with that. Say I don'twant anybody granted immunity.EHRLICHMAN:It's a matter of public policy, I can't haveit.PRESIDENT:Yep. I'd say (unintelligible)...telling youthat (unintelligible) President what would, what would Petersen's (unintelligible) itall say, ah the President's ah, ah...EHRLICHMAN:Tying our hands.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.47PRESIDENT:tying our hands but no, we're not tellingDean not to talk.

PRESIDENT:And also it looks like a cover up HALDEMAN:And particularly somebody with whom youhappen to be, head of the Criminal Division,happens to be very closely, personally associated in this case. Now, ah, ahEHRLICHMAN:Pete, Petersen, isn't it? I think maybe thepoint that Petersen's missing...ah, ah maybeintentionally so, is that Dean is a major actor in this thing.PRESIDENT:Yep.EHRLICHMAN:And, ah, big fish/small fish nevertheless,if a major actor gets immunity and justs walks away from the White House, havingcommitted 89 crimesPRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHIMAN:Ah, that, and it's your Justice Department.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.48PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And the guy that grants it is reportingdaily to you.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:What does that say? That says: "Gee, Ididn't want my counsel to get hurt.&#64258; Theonly question that remains is why didn't he grant immunity to everybody.HALDEMAN:What it says is exactly that point, that thecounsel knows more than (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Now, should I have any more conversationswith Dean?EHRLICHMAN:No, I don't think you should. I think youought to send him a note and tell him what your decision is.PRESIDENT:All right.

Now we&#8482;ve got a White House legal case and we got no White House lawyer, you know, there's anotherinteresting end to look at.PRESIDENT:Where's Fielding stand on all this? HALDEMAN:He's Dean&#8482;s creature. Lives next door tohim, Dean sponsored him.PRESIDENT:What do we do to him?

House, and ah, yetColson's, Colson's remedy of course is get him out and fire him. All right.EHRLICHMAN:Colson would like to discredit him...PRESIDENT:Well I know; but ah, what the hell he's uh,ah, the question is what he would do to discredit us.EHRLICHMAN:Well, in my view...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) that's a problem. HALDEMAN:Yeah, but I think you, got to, at some, somepoint, like you do on anything else, yougotta face up to the fact that the guy iseither a friend or a foe or a neutral. If he's a neutral you don't have to worry abouthim; if he's a friend you rely on him, andif he's a foe, you fight him, and this guy, it seems...(unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:Well at least.HALDEMAN:to find is a foe.PRESIDENT:At, at a, least when I talked to him, Isaid, "Now, now, John any conversations are,are privileged do you realize that?" "Yes"I said, "Anything for national security or anything&#64258; I said, &#64257;was privileged, you understand.&#64258; He said, "Yes. And I'lltestify to that."

(Unintelligible)...EHRLICHMAN:I think, ah.PRESIDENT:...understand that. The point is, the pointis if, if you break it off with him, then he could go out and say &#64257;Screw the privilege.&#64258;HALDEMAN:No he can't. It's not his privilege, it'syours.EHRLICHMAN:It's yours.PRESIDENT:I know it's mine but ah&#352;HALDEMAN:He screws the privilege, he's finished. EHRLICHMAN:Well. I think you have to charge HenryPetersen or whoever you get, gets as a manin charge here with protecting yourprivilege and then that's got to go down to Silbert and Silbert has to be cautioned that he is not to go into matters of executiveprivilege and he is not to go into mattersof national security importance.PRESIDENT:Any matters involving a conversation withthe President, involve national security, ifthey want to know anything, they can ask me.EHRLICHMAN:Now, ah, the question comes up, I don't knowhow far this will run, but this caper inCalifornia, for instance. Ah, Colson askedme.PRESIDENT:Which caper?EHRLICHMAN:This, this thing of Hunt's out there, thethe national security thing they connected Ellsberg.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.59PRESIDENT:That's right. They haven't found it yet.EHRLICHMAN:Well Petersen knows about it. I think. It'slaying around somewhere, but ah, if thequestion comes up, Colson says "Hbw do I handle thatI said,Chuck, well, if I wereasked that, I would say that, "That is anational, that was a national security project and I'm not in the position to answer a question on that, ah, because Ithink it falls within the ambit of executiveprivilege."PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:"Now, I would have to refer it to thePresident for a waiver of executive privilege on that if he desired to do so." And he said,"Well can I say the same thing?"And I said, &#64257;Well, I don't know whether youcan or not.&#64258; He said, &#64257;Well what would the President say if it's referred to him?&#64258; And I said &#64257;I don't know, I haven't asked him.&#64258;PRESIDENT:That's what we'd say.EHRLICHMAN:Ok? Can I tell him that... PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:for you?PRESIDENT:All right. EHRLICHMAN:All right.

HALDEMAN:...just ridiculous and he said, he raisedthe point. Now my feeling on that pointremember that, that, Jesus, you can't sayit's a million dollars. It may be 10 million dollars.PRESIDENT:That's rightHALDEMAN:Once we get into that. PRESIDENT:That's right, that's right.HALDEMAN:And that we...PRESIDENT:ought to...APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.63HALDEMAN:That we ought not to be in this and then weleft it, you know, we can't do anythingabout it anyway. We don't have any money,and ah, it isn't a question to be directed here. This is something, relates toMitchell's problem. Ehrlichman has noproblem with the thing with Hunt. And Ehrlichman said; &#64257;Christ, if you're going to get into blackmail, the hell with it."PRESIDENT:Good. The word blackmail, thank God youwere in there when it happened, but you remember the conversation.HALDEMAN:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:I didn't tell him to go get the money, didI?HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:No you didn't, you didn't either, did you?HALDEMAN:Absolutely not. I said, "You've got to talkto Mitchell, this is something you got to work out with Mitchell, not here, there'snothing we can do about it here."PRESIDENT:I think we've got a pretty good record onthat one, John, at least.HALDEMAN:Ah, but there's a couple of complications becan throw in there (unintelligible) which would be of concern, but I just can't conceive that a guy, he may, I can see himusing it as a threat. I cannot see himsinking low enough to use that. I, I Just, although I must admit the guy has reallyturned into an unbelieveable disaster forus.PRESIDENT:Yes. HALDEMAN:But I can't, people don't, he's notun-American and anti-Nixon. I'll tell youwhat he did, I'll tell you during that period.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.64PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:he busted his ass trying to work this out,and it wore him to a frazzle and I think itprobably wore him past the point of rationality. I think he may now be in, amental state that's causing him to do thingsthat, that ah, when he sobers up, he's going to be very disturbed about with himself.PRESIDENT:Also, he's probably got a very, very clevernew lawyer named Shaffer. I think that'spart of the problem.HALDEMAN:Could very well be.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Could very well be. But John, I can'tbelieve is a basically dishonorable guy. I think there's no question John is a strongself-promoter, self-motivated guy for hisown good, but ah.PRESIDENT:Yet in that conversation. I, we were I wasvery, I said, "Well for Christ s sake--but,ah."HALDEMAN:You explored in that conversation thepossibility of whether such kinds of moneycould be raised. You said, "Well, Christ,we ought to be able to raise money."PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:How much money is involved and he said,"Well, it could be a million dollars overthe next year."PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:I said, &#64257;That's ridiculous. You can't say amillion maybe you say a million, it may be 2 or 10, and, ah."APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.65PRESIDENT:But then we got into the blackmail.HALDEMAN:You said, &#64257;Once you start down the path withblackmail, and ah, it's constant escalation,and--"PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah. That's my only...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...conversation with regard to that. HALDEMAN:They could jump and then say to us, "Wellthat was morally wrong.&#64258; What you shouldhave said is "Blackmail is wrong, not thatit&#8482;s too costly.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Oh, well, at that point that we got into(unintelligible) we went into theinvestigation.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) that's right. PRESIDENT:You see my point? We were then in thebusiness of the, this was, this was one ofDean's, when he was, ah, was it after that we sent him to Camp David?EHRLICHMAN:You sent him to Camp David on about the, ah,20...PRESIDENT:I would like to know with regard to thatconversation, Bob, I just wanted to know.EHRLICHMAN:It took place about the 23rd, that is histrip to Camp David, about the 23rd of March.HALDEMAN:When, when was that Hunt threat? EHRLICHMAN:I haven't any idea. I have no idea.PRESIDENT:Get that worked out, please.HALDEMAN:I don't know, better check on it. PRESIDENT:Well, it, oh hell.EHRLICHMAN:Well, you'll know the date of your meetinghere.HALDEMAN:Well, uh, uh, you can't--APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.66PRESIDENT:Well, (unintelligible) to say, I supposethen we should have cut it off, shut it off,because later on you met in your office and,I mean, and Mitchell said, "That was taken care of."EHRLICHMAN:The next day.HALDEMAN:That's right. UNIDENTIFIED:The same day. HALDEMAN:Maybe I can find the date by that.PRESIDENT:Yeah and Dean, Dean was there and said,&#64257;What about this money for Hunt?&#64258; Wasn't Dean there?HALDEMAN:No, what happened was, Ehrlichman and Deanand Mitchell and I were in the office, my office, and we were discussing other matters. And in the process of it, Mitchellsaid, &#64257;Let me raise one point&#64258;, and heturned to Dean. He said, &#64257;Let me raise another point, ah, have you taken care of the, the is the other problem, Hunt'sproblem?&#64258; Something like that. I don'tknow how he referred to it. But we all knew instantly what he was, what he meant andDean kind of looked a little flustered andsaid, &#64257;Well, well, ah, no, I mean I don't know where that is&#64258; or something; and Mitchell said, &#64257;Well I guess it's taken careof.&#64258; And so we assumed from that, thatMitchell had taken care of it, and there was no further squeak out of it, so I now doassume Mitchell took care of it so...PRESIDENT:Yeah, the problem I have there is I said,(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Mitchell that LaRue, as I understand it,LaRue was Mitchell's agent, but ah...PRESIDENT:Yeah, as I understand it, what I meant is,I'm just trying to seek out whether, I'mjust seeing what are Dean's lines of attackare.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.67HALDEMAN:And you're saying, "Did I know about that?&#64258;I did. Yeah, there's no question.PRESIDENT:Say, "Yes there was talk about it and soforth, and Mitchell took care of it, but, ah, gee, but, ah, on the other hand, youmake the case as to (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:You can't testify to that, it'sPresidential--PRESIDENT:In this office, but not in the other office,not in your office.HALDEMAN:O.k. but in the other office the questionof, of...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:and, and the specifics never arose. Andthere again Dean is the agent on it. Dean's coming in, saying, "What should I do?"Dean's the agent on all this. That's wheremy money goes. All the input to me about the 350 came from Dean, and all the output came from Dean. That's the only time I...PRESIDENT:Then Dean was the one that said, &#64257;Look Bob,we need 350 for or need the rest of the money."HALDEMAN:No, they didn't even come that way. Deansaid, &#64257;They need money for the defense."PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:For their fees.PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:And that's the, was always put that way,that's the way it was always discussed.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.68PRESIDENT:Right. That's why I want that line. Ithink that's most important, you can workon. Get a lawyer. (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:And I said. PRESIDENT:lawyer.HALDEMAN:And I said to Dean at that time, "Well lookyou've got a situation here. We've got the 300, I thought it was 350, it was 328, in cash that we needed to get turned back tothe committee.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:Apparently they had a need for money so wehave a coincidence (unintelligible)--now youought to be able to work out some way to get them to take the cash and that will take care of our needs, and apparently help meettheir needs.PRESIDENT:Right, right. HALDEMAN:Then he went back to Mitchell, and Mitchellwouldn't do it, and then they agreed to take40 thousand of it, which they did, andshortly thereafter they agreed to take the rest, which they did.PRESIDENT:Do you think did you check with(unintelligible) before the election and shortly afterwards?HALDEMAN:It was not before the election, no.PRESIDENT:On that was what Dean's story was about andDean said it was before.HALDEMAN:Strachan.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Strachan says it was in late November, the30th, on 29th or, some nonsense like that.EHRLICHMAN:Incidentally, remember you told me that, ahStrachan had gone over there with Colson'spartner and that the Judge wouldn't take him.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.69EHRLICHMAN:It turned out that it was Howard who wentover, who with ah, Dick Howard went overwith one of Colson's partners and the U.S.Attorney kicked up a fuss about it. Ah, saying that there might be a communicationbetween the partner and Colson.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:And so ah HALDEMAN:Stracban's lawyer is a totally separate guythat he's acquired from somebody he knew inlaw school.PRESIDENT:Good.EHRLICHMAN:Now, Colson has pitched me to retain hispartner, which I think would be a mistake.PRESIDENT:You? EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:You can't retain his partner.EHRLICHMAN:I don't think so. HALDEMAN and PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Be a big mistake because it would create anidentity, ah between me and Colson, that I don't feel comfortable with.PRESIDENT:I don't want you to do it that way.HALDEMAN:Whether you can't or not I think you'd beout of your mind to do it.PRESIDENT:Don't get in there with Colson, ah, Colsonwill, he'll defend himself.HALDEMAN:Well, obviously, Colson sees that as a wayof...APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.70EHRLICHMAN:Sure.HALDEMAN:Getting in.EHRLICHMAN:Sure.HALDEMAN:(Uninteiligible). EHRLICHMAN:SureHALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Sure. HALDEMAN:We should not give Colson reason to getsqueamish though...PRESIDENT:No.EHRLICHMAN:I'm cultivating him. PRESIDENT:No, sir.EHRLICHMAN:I'm cultivating him, I'm keeping him on theteam. He feels that there is a coincidence of interest between you and me and him.PRESIDENT:Right, that's fine.HALDEMAN:Let him:consider (unintelllgible)EHRLICHMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:Right, all the time, all the time, comingback now to the, ah, decision on the gameplan, well, first should we make a statementtoday?HALDEMAN:I would say yes.EHRLICHMAN:Yep.HALDEMAN:I think it's a good... PRESIDENT:Should I make it, sbould Ziegler make it?APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.71HALDEMAN:Ziegler should make it.EHRLICHMAN:Well, let me argue that you should.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:ah, if it is a... PRESIDENT:in a press conference--EHRLICHMAN:...if it is a carefully limited statement.PRESIDENT:Yeah, no questions though. EHRLICHMAN:I think-- PRESIDENT:You would take questions, wouldn&#8482;t you?EHRLICHMAN:No, sir, and, and, and I think it should bea very tight statement, a very conservative--PRESIDENT:I should read it.EHRLICHMAN:Well, at least you should think it throughas you...PRESIDENT:Oh, yes.EHRLICHMAN:...usually do. So that you can, ah--PRESIDENT:I mean, ah... EHRLICHMAN:Uh, stay away from the soft places. Butthink broadly across the country people arewaiting to see your face on the evening newstalking about the Watergate case...PRESIDENT:Right, OK.EHRLICHMAN:And making your assurances of...PRESIDENT:Bill Rogers said thisAPRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.72EHRLICHMAN andPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:His first thought about using Ziegler and aswe left the boat last night, said, &#64257;I&#8482;ve been been thinking about it," said he, hetotally rules out the 9:00 thing. He said,"Apparently not.&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:Good. PRESIDENT:He says, "For Christ's sake&#64258;, he says,&#64257;Don&#8482;t make it the only story in town, it'llbe the only story in town&#64258;, he said &#64257;for 3 or 4 months. And that would be fine.That's all right (unintelligible)...don'tthe (unintelligible)...&#64258;HALDEMAN:You know where the Watergate story is in theWashington Post today? Page 19.PRESIDENT:We wish it would die out.EHRLICHMAN:Well, they're laying in the weeds. We're inan ebb tide right now.PRESIDENTBut I know, I know, we and it'll be page 19in five months from now if we handle itright (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Now I suggested having Petersen stand by. Idon't think that's a good idea.PRESIDENT:No. no, not at all, no I simply gotta, goout there and I should say, should make a statement? O.k., uh, John, let's come backto this business here, let's, ah, come backto the, come back to the, the business of the (pause)-which is the play of the WhiteHouse leaders.EHRLICHMAN:Um. PRESIDENT:Doesn't work. EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.73EHRLICHMAN:In view of the foregoingin view of allthat's gone and all that's been said I thinkif you can get the results of having Deanout of his office, and I wouldn't worry about the files. I think you could put iton a basis that if he needs a file he couldget it, ah, upon loan so that you could, at least, you would be able to monitor what he was getting. Ah, I think it, that it...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) come and get it.EHRLICHMAN:Well he could arrange, so he didn't. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Ah, that, ah, you would say to him, "In viewof your relationship with the U.S. Attorney's office, I just don't think it is prudent for you to be on the grounds."PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:"And you're going to have to work fromsomeplace else."HALDEMAN:"I don't think there's any appearanceproblem because you have been for a monthanyway."EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;Right, it won't be noticed. If we areasked in the press room...&#64258;PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;...ah, what your status is...&#64258; PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;We'll finesse it."PRESIDENT:&#64257;That's right, there'll be no change...&#64258;APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.74EHRLICHMAN:And if the question will come, "Well, hasJohn Dean been placed on leave?&#64258; "No."."Has John Dean been fired?&#64258;PRESIDENT:"No.&#64258; Alright, alright. EHRLICHMAN:And you, and you could say to him, &#64257;If youdon't bring it up, we won't."PRESIDENT:Alright, OK. EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;If this leaks, it'll leak from you becausenobody is going to know it&#64258;PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:"And, uh, as far as Bob and John areconcerned, I will make an appropriatearrangement with them.&#64258;PRESIDENT:I'm going to make an appropriate arrangementcov, covering them. Course it's something different.&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;But I cannot be in a position of having youdictate to me what it should be."PRESIDENT:I, ah, that's right. HALDEMAN:And you can't be in a position.(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:No, I can tell him I've made an appropriatearrangement but it's got to be in my own, uhin my own way, ah depending from here...EHRLICHMAN:Well--more than that, I think you couldargue with, with him that the transition from John Dean being away from here...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...and the transition of Haldeman being awayfrom here...APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.75PRESIDENT:Or Ehrlichman.EHRLICHMAN:...is a very different kind of thing.PRESIDENT:That's right, that's right, that's right.EHRLICHMAN:And so it would have to be something that... PRESIDENT:&#64257;But we're not asking...&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:...you considered appropriate.PRESIDENT:&#64257;...we're not asking anybody to resign, John EHRLICHMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:&#64257;...because I think that would prejudicetheir rights."EHRLICHMAN:Taking a formal leave. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) all right, fine, you dothat, but, but, if you're rejecting theGarment proposal that everybody take a leave until everybody&#8482;s cleared that I (unintelligible) a moment ago?EHRLICHMAN:Well.HALDEMAN:No, I'm asking. EHRLICHMAN:I think a leave is the same thing as beingfired in this context.PRESIDENT:Do you Bob?EHRLICHMAM:Prior to the charges being filed... HALDEMAN:Prior to charges, when you have charges...EHRLICHMAN:That's different.HALDEMAN:Well now, here's the point of information. PRESIDENT:Here's the point, here's the point, let me,let me, tell you what's going to happen, inmy view. And, by charges I don't meanindictments.EHRLICHMAN:I understand that.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.76PRESIDENT:But ah, when they, when they finally make(Continued)their deal with Magruder (unintelligible) yougotta keep them out of the D.C. jail, ah,they're going to take him into open court.This is their deal, now because Judge Siricaquestions him, right, says to John last night, "They are going to make," he said,"statement.&#64258; Now I would assume then thecharges would be made, at least as far as, asMagruder is concerned.HALDEMAN:And they said Magruder makes charges againstme? (Pause) Cause that's really interesting.PRESIDENT:Bob, Bob, I don't know whether he does or notlet's say, let's, let's be damned sure ifwe...EHRLICHMAN:What you are saying...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) that day he's certainly goingto say that Dean was involved and thatMitchell was involved.EHRLICHMAN:And he'll say, "Strachan was involved."PRESIDENT:And he'll say, "Strachan was involved."EHRLICHMAN:And who's Strachan. Well, Strachan was... PRESIDENT:Mr. Haldeman's...EHRLICHMAN:...employee.PRESIDENT:And Strachan.EHRLICHMAN:...but my prediction is it will never, ifthey, if the Judge says, "Well, did Mr.Haldeman tell you to do anything, or this orthat," he'll say, &#64257;Nosir, he was never involved in this." Flat out.PRESIDENT:He'll say that.HALDEMAN:He, he says he told me that is what he wouldsay.EHRLICHMAN:And he told me that is what he would say.HALDEMAN:He told John that is what he would say infront of his lawyers. That what he had said.PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.77HALDEMAN:...and he flatly says, "That is what is thetruth.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:And it is what's the truth. PRESIDENT:All right.HALDEMAN:Now if ah--PRESIDENT:So your view, John and Bob is that you, youknow that ah, you got to look at, got to look at the other point of being eaten awayand then having to come in, say, "Look myusefulness has been so impaired I must leave."HALDEMAN:No, I don't expect to be eaten away. Ithink when I get hit on anything publicly...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Let's say Magruder does name me. Let's sayMagruder does implicate me in the Watergate.PRESIDENT:Or Dean. Let"s suppose Dean... HALDEMAN:Publicly, someone that's known publicly. Assoon as Dean is...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) yeah.HALDEMAN:...is known publicly... PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...my view would be that I should then, Ishould request you...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...to give me a leave of absence.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.78PRESIDENT:So that you can fight.HALDEMAN:...so that I can deal with this matter untilit is cleared up.EHRLICHMAN:It'll, it'll depend a little bit, I wouldthink on...PRESIDENT:Do youEHRLICHMAN:...on degree. PRESIDENT:Degree. EHRLICHMAN:If it is a Jack Anderson column...PRESIDENT:Oh, uh, no newspaperEHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:...now the point that I make, another pointI make is the relation that I have now isthis case. Suppose that the Assistant Attorney General comes in, as he has recently, says, "Now Magruder,(unintelligible) Magruder and Dean have madecharges.&#64258; The point is whether Dean has, the point is his argument is, "Now you have an, knowledge, sir, and you as President,should act on that knowledge(unintelligible) charges. I'm telling you now that those charges are in the possessionof the government. That's what I'm sittingon."HALDEMAN:O.k., but what's this, than you do that. Ihappen to know what his motive is and I'llsure as hell use it (unintelligible).PRESIDENT, HALDEMAN, andEHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:All right, all right, you say, "Mr.Assistant Attorney General, I want to explain my policy to youso that you'll knowwhat our relationship is. My policy is, thatI will immediately suspend on leave anybody against whom formal charges are filed byindictment or information."APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.79PRESIDENT:By information you mean, that ah..EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;...to see if they don't go before the grandjury.&#64258;EHRLICHMAN and PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;In other words, formal charges are filed.The second that happens, those men will go on leave.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Um.EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;This is a town that is so full of wildcharges that if I operated on the other basis, even of those who were brought to meby 20 bishops and an Attorney General, Icouldn't be suspending people around here or the place would look like a piece of swiss cheese. But let me suggest you do this.You go ahead, diligently pursue the Haldemanand Ehrlichman cases because I need to know."PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;And if you come to me and say that youfiled charges, then I'll have really no discretion in the matter."PRESIDENT:In effect, if you come to me and say thatyou are going to indict them...EHRLICHMAN"criminal charges...&#64258; PRESIDENT:&#64257;Criminal charges, then I'll at that timemove instantly...&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:&#64257;...before we do it: publicly.&#64258;APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.80EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;...or Dean or anybody else."PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:"But I can't treat them any different fromanybody else. And you have brought me basically, ah uncorroborated charges. Atthis point...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;...you've said so yourself that you aren'tgoing to be able to deal with Dean, onuncorroborated (unintelligible)."PRESIDENT:I feel, I feel comfortable with that. Ifeel comfortable with that.EHRLICHMAN:But, if you lay out the general ground rulesfirst--PRESIDENT and HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Why is it, what, is it basically, I, I, I, Iwhat basically, John, what the hell is the Garment, Rose, I guess Moore argument (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:They're writing a New York Times editorial(Pause).PRESIDENT:Which is what?EHRLICHMAN:Which is that ah, this is a terrible cancerat the heart of the Presidency, and that there must be, there must be drastic surgery and that you in a case like this, you leanover backwards and...PRESIDENT:fire them...APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.81EHRLICHMAN:and so forth. Ah, which I'm sure it will bean editorial in many, many newspapers. Thatah, Dean has raised serious charges and soon and so forth. And you'll hear a lot of that. Maybe the thing to do is for Zieglerif he gets a question about suspension orfiring, to say, "This is the President's general poliqy without regard to individuals."PRESIDENT:Sure.EHRLICHMAN:"Any individuals who's found by the grandjury...&#64258;PRESIDENT:Can, why don't I say that today?EHRLICHMAN:That's fine. PRESIDENT:All right. EHRLICHMAN:That's fine.PRESIDENT:All right, I think I got, got the message.If you go write just a brief, brief, brief statement. You know, that I can use here, or do you have one, get it back to me quickly.I have to do this at 3:00 today, 3:30.EHRLICHMAN:All right. PRESIDENT:How much time have I got?HALDEMAN:3:00 or 3:30EHRLICHMAN:You've got about 45 minutes to an hour. HALDEMAN:An hour and a half. PRESIDENT:I've got plenty of time.HALDEMAN:Uh, Ziegler should delay the 3:00. They've,they've only scheduled a posting. He can put out...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:He can make it 4:00. He can announce thebriefing at 4:00.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.82PRESIDENT:Yeah, that's right.HALDEMAN:You ought to tell him now though, thatyou're going to do it though.TRESIDENT:I think I better do that. HALDEMAN:I've gotta, better get Ron in and quickly,while we&#8482;re here...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...and review this to see whether he is ontop in other words, whether's there's sometechnical problem he doesn't know about.PRESIDENT:Just tell them to send Ron in. EHRLICHMAN:Right, sure.HALDEMAN:Would you get Ziegler?(Thirty-nine second pause)HALDEMAN:Any question about my theory now? EHRLICHMAN:I wonder if we should talk to him about howto operate in the next couple days.(Unintelligible) lot of suspicion before we will grant him immunity.HALDEMAN:I thought so too.EHRLICHMAN:I don't think so, it would be on the wires,I would think...PRESIDENT:Well.EHRLICHMAN:But, ah...HALDEMAN:Even if they have, they could withdraw it,if they get him before he acts.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. Now with, with ah, us out ofthe play here for a couple of weeks, ah...PRESIDENT:...working on this matter EHRLICHMAN:...ah, you're going to need a different modeof operation on the domestic side.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.83PRESIDENT:Yeah, Cole (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:And Ken is fully abreast of everything.PRESIDENT:All right.EHRLICHMAN:And I think you ought to just call himdirect when you have something.PRESIDENT:I will, oh, I'll use him...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, fine. PRESIDENT:...just like I'd use you say, "Ken I'vegotta rely on you to wear two hats for awhile."HALDEMAN:Well, looks like you've got no problem, my,well basically my office can run itself. Tocover, your, your bases, you can deal withSteve.PRESIDENT:Steve? HALDEMAN:On a schedule basis, you'd be better off todeal with Parker. You haven't started doingit so you probably gonna want to.PRESIDENT:Oh, sure, and, uh like the basic things asto what we do...HALDEMAN:...that we review and...PRESIDENT:Okay. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) would talk to me aboutParker...PRESIDENT:Deal with Parker. HALDEMAN:...better, he knows the schedule... PRESIDENT:I'd like to get acquainted with him anyway.HALDEMAN:Parker knows the reasons behind everything.PRESIDENT:...take a little of that off your shouldersin the future...HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:...John and I were talking about that, Iwant you, let me ask, let me, let us, let us notAPRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.84PRESIDENT:overlook one greater, let us suppose no(Continued)charges are filed, oh, ah, and uh, basicallycharges filed like the charges filed incourt (unintelligible/REMOVED) if it's veryserious (unintelligible) he had knowledgethat the charges might be that Haldeman, theuh, had knowledge of, in advance er, uh, that he is ah, and that he ah, he participated in the money, the ah, cover up,I'm trying to put Bob worse...EHRLICHMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:Then Bob, I think, should take with you doyou agree Bob?HALDEMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:If they make that kind of charge cause theheat would really go on. But in John's case, they make the deep six charge, I said that's tough, I don't think I'd, I'd takewith you on that.EHRLICHMAN:It's up to you. HALDEMAN:I think ah...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) no, I mean that's adifference in degree.HALDEMAN:Well I think then each of those is somethingthat, you have, we have to deal with at thetime...PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:...in the context of the time because Idon't think you can anticipate now what thatcontext will be. You don't know what the newspapers stories will be. For instance, right now, and that's another argumentagainst you taking any action regarding meparticularly...PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.85HALDEMAN:...is that I'm not in the thing at all...PRESIDENT:Um hum.HALDEMAN:...in the public mind, and it would bestartling as hell...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yeah, but incidentally another reason fornot going the Garment road is basically the uh, the uh, uh he wants, John, he wantsMitchell separated (unintelligible). Hesaid, "By God, Mitchell's got to come out first (unintelligible).&#64258; See my point?UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.PRESIDENT:I don't suppose that's occurred to you? UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah, a point like that... PRESIDENT:I think what we do, I think I will make abrief statement today, and I was wonderinghow late I can make it? 3:30?ZIEGLER:You can make it at 4:00 or 4:l5. PRESIDENT:Fine, don't make it 3:30.ZIEGLER:But we can...PRESIDENT:...or 4:00, but I'll have to have to get towork on it.HALDEMAN:We'll call them in.PRESIDENT:Yeah, call them in and ah, do you think, Ishould have them, uh, let me ask you this, all of you. Do you want me ontelevision,...EHRLICHMAN:Yes sir. PRESIDENT:...speaking on the evening news?EHRLICHMAN:That would be my preference.PRESIDENT:O.k., I'll just walk out.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.86HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).ZIEGLER:I think, ah, depending on the, you know,REEL 3 BEGINSstatement, though they'll get it to the lab.PRESIDENT:Don't worry.ZIEGLER:They can get it on.PRESIDENT:Oh, sure. ZIEGLER:That's what I mean, that's what I'mthinking. I'll get the statement out.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) John (unintelligible).ZIEGLER:I'll just say you have that flexibility from3:30 to 4:l5.PRESIDENT:Fine, fine.REEL 2 ENDS. Okay. We'll try to get itout...(Unintelligible).APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.87ZIEGLER:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).ZIEGLER:Uh hum.PRESIDENT:okay (unintelligible) HALDEMAN:I need you (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Oh, yeah. Ron, I need that uh--ZIEGLER:This? EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Where's page one? ZIEGLER:It's -says page one.EHRLICHMAN:Good work. (Laugh)PRESIDENT:I wonder, John, (unintelligible) I wonder(unintelligible) unless you sank Doan,basically, if we're putting too muchemphasis on the fact (unintelligible) in that office. Understand, (unintelligible), I'm just thinking of what it is worth to usto get him out of the goddamned office. I'drelieve him of his duties.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.88EHRLICHMAN:Well, the alternative is somehow or other topass the word to everybody in the place thathe's a pariah.PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:I don't know how you do that.PRESIDENT:What? What do you mean everybody in theplace?EHRLICHMAN:I mean people like, uh, the like the, uh,White House Police. That if they get asubpoena, they shouldn't ask him what to do.The Secret Service, a guy like Dick Howard.HALDEMAN:Who should they ask?EHRLICHMAN:Damned good question.PRESIDENT:Moore. EHRLICHMAN:Make Moore Acting Counsel? (Laughter)(Unintelligible) discussing what to do inthe White House. He has very good judgment.HALDEMAN:Very good judgment and absolutely noprocedural knowledge.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Garment?HALDEMAN:He's worse. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Fielding? (Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Hey. Let Fielding be the operative. Saythat he can take no action on anything without checking with Moore.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.89PRESIDENT:Hw's that sound, John?EHRLICHMAN:That's good.PRESIDENT:On this case (unintelligible) Dick Moore.HALDEMAN:Fielding is to be the front man as DeputyCounsel, but he is to report toPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:to Dick Moore. PRESIDENT:But you see, uh, (unintelligible) I don&#8482;tthink it's worth. (Unintelligible) I justdon't know that it's good. Uh, I mean, Imean Dean's sort of a, a, uh, uh, whether that kind of action it is, is worth takingthat kind of risk.EHRLICHMAN:Well, if he's here, people will go to himfor advice. I'm, I'm just sure of it.PRESIDENT:I've told him he's not to give any advice,and he's not to have anything to do withthis case at all. All right?EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. I, maybe I'm being, maybe I'mbeing unduly, uh, unduly harsh, but, uh, andmaybe the negatives are more than, than the,the positives...PRESIDENT:Let me judge.EHRLICHMAN:...it just seems to be that it can be donewithout breaking any eggs.PRESIDENT:I can just say, "Well, people are coming in.They're on the White House Police now(unintelligible) and so forth...&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:Say, uh, PRESIDENT:...I think if he's there it's going to lookstrange if he doesn't take leave.EHRLICHMAN:Well, it puts him in an impossible conflictof-interest situation.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.90PRESIDENT:Yeah. That's right.HALDEMAN:That's the problem. He knows what is comingin--what questions are coming, and thenhe...PRESIDENT:All right. The second point on hand nowwith regard to Petersen, uh, that, uh, the,uh -I better get him in and tell him (unintelligible) that's of the highest priority.HALDEMAN:Yeah, and the no immunity thing.PRESIDENT:And you just flatly say, "Now this is theway I'm going to handle the matter.(Unintelligible) I cannot let people gosimply because charges are made until they are corrorborated. That's my decision," and so forth. "And second, I've, I've thoughtover the immunity thing and I want nobody onthe White House staff given immunity. I don't want anybody shown any consideration whatever.&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:"This has been a law and orderadministration (unintelligible) in which we (unintelligible)"PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Right. "Dean cannot,cannot be in a position (unintelligible) so forth (unintelligible). And third, I'm directing everybody to cooperate. I'vealready helped him on, on the Liddy(unintelligible) I've tried. They've been told they are not to (unintelligible) thePresident, but I will continue to, I, I,will not have a number of the White House staff going into the Senate testifying against others."(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible). Now, yes, sir, and Ithink that the fourth point that you should cover with him at the earliest possible timeis that if I'm before that Grand Jury and Iam asked about Dean's information within the Grand Jury, I will have to say that Dean told me that it came from Petersen.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.91PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And, there's no point in your getting wayout .by saying out here to the press, "I'mrelying on Henry Petersen as my good right hand," and then have him compromised at alater time.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:I think you must, from here on PRESIDENT:Put a shot across the bow.HALDEMAN:Well, but also, the one thing I would justurge that you don't, from now on, until this is totally done, which may be never, expressconfidence in anybody...PRESIDENT:I know... HALDEMAN:...just, for God's sake, don't say, &#64257;I knowthis guy is doing the thing right oranything else.&#64258; That applies to me, toEhrlichman...PRESIDENT:Well, you know how I feel. HALDEMAN:Yes, but don't say it. I mean it justdoesn't serve the, the cause properly. AndI don't think you should say it. I think it's a very bad-and you should not aboutHenry Petersen or John Dean, or anybodyelse.PRESIDENT:Ron, now, basically, uh, Ron can handle allthat (unintelligible). We're not going tocomment on this matter until uh...HALDEMAN:And Ron must not say it either. Don't letRon con you into saying, "Well, I have fullconfidence in Mister what's his name and, uhall the rest.&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:I got a name today and I don't know anythingabout this fellow -but let me advance hisname to you, as an alternative. There's aAPRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.92EHRLICHMAN:lawyer here in town by the named of Herbert(Continued)Miller. You may know him. He was head ofthe criminal division in the JusticeDepartment, the job Petersen has. He was there from '6l through &#8218;67, under Kennedyand Johnson, but he's a Republican.PRESIDENT:Yeah, all right. EHRLICHMAN:Now, uh, it may be possible to get a fellowlike that...PRESIDENT:to substitute.EHRLICHMAN:...to substitute. PRESIDENT:I don't know. I guess it's moving too fast.So you call in a substitute, so he's got tolearn the goddamned case. He's got to make the bargaining plea with uh, with uh...EHRLICHMAN:Okay. He reviews it then. He reviews it.He gets the complete file with the pros andthe cons and he goes through it and he draws on seven years experience and maybe he comes over to you and he says, "I've got to callthis shot and, uh, I wonder if you haveanything to add?&#64258;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) come in here and counsel?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, but as your counsel, he has no controlover, over the prosecution.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Petersen (unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:That's right, and he's feeding a bunch ofbaloney in my opinion.PRESIDENT:Well, it's uh, it's all over.(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:He also, of course, apparently, Iunderstand, told you that Strachan got very good treatment over there.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.93PRESIDENT:No, no, no. He told me the contrary.HALDEMAN:Oh.PRESIDENT:He said Strachan just got the hell beat outof him.HALDEMAN:But he did, d-he. He was absolutelyastonished. He came out of there and he saidit was just beyond belief. He told me that (unintelligible). They threatened his life practically, told him he better hire...PRESIDENT:a lawyer.HALDEMAN:best possible counsel. Provide for supportfor his wife and children because he'd begoing to jail, and that, uh, he was inserious trouble, He would be disbarred. You know, they just...PRESIDENT:We're playing a rough game.EHRLICHMAN:Well, what they are trying to do is put himin the hands of an attorney who'll deal for immunity.HALDEMAN:'They are trying to get him to make the sameplay that Dean and Magruder made.PRESIDENT:That's right. That's right. EHRLICHMAN:And I have no doubt...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I have no doubt that they savaged Dean thesame way.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...and they, they scored on him. Uh, well,all I'm saying to you is, I don't think in terms of the kind of stuff they are talkingabout down there, that it's all thatcomplicated for an experienced man to pick up, so I wouldn't want to think that this guy is indispensable.APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.94PRESIDENT:Yeah, all right but should I make thatdecision today?EHRLICHMAN:Well, every day that goes by is, is uh,going to make it that much tougher on somebody new coming in and you got a guy inhere that that I wouldn't trust, knowingwhat I know, and maybe you can, maybe you can discuss that--PRESIDENT:This guy gets relieved (unintelligible) and,uh says, "Well, I told the President that heought to fire Haldeman and Ehrlichman and he fires Dean."EHRLICHMAN:I don't think that he would say that. He'sa pro. He's been around this town a long time and he knows that if he said that, you would come right back and say, "No, thereason that I fired him is that I've reasonto believe that he is responsible for leaks out of the Grand Jury," and that would destroy him.PRESIDENT:Okay. Shall I first, uh get that paper backto (unintelligible)?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, I'll get it right back.PRESIDENT:Second, shall I, shall I get Dean downfirst?EHRLICHMAN:I would. PRESIDENT:And I'd tell him that--EHRLICHMAN:Tell him you are going to make a statementand that it is not going to refer to him.PRESIDENT:Yep.EHRLICHMAN:And, that uh--PRESIDENT:All right. Fine. EHRLICHMAN:Or anybody, and that you're going to dealwith the people at the White House on anindividual basis. Individual basis you'redealing with him (unintelligible).APRIL 17, 1973, FROM 12:35 TO 2:20 P.M.95HALDEMAN:Give Petersen a call maybe first(unintelligible) immunity (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yeah. Get Petersen in first. Uh, just, uh,call and tell Petersen to (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:All right.
