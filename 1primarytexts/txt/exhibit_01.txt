HALDEMAN IN THE OVALOFFICE ON JUNE 23, 1972 FROM10:04 TO 11:39 AMJune 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM3**********HALDEMAN:okay -that's fine. Now, on the investi-gation, you know, the Democratic break-inthing, we're back to the-in the, the problem area because the FBI is not under control,because Gray doesn't exactly know how tocontrol them, and they have, their investigation is now leading into some productive areas, because they've been ableto trace the money, not through the moneyitself, but through the bank, you know, sources - the banker himself. And, and it goes in some directions we don't want it togo. Ah, also there have been some things,like an informant came in off the street to the FBI in Miami, who was a photographer orhas a friend who is a photographer whodeveloped some films through this guy, Barker, and the films had pictures of Democratic National Committee letter headdocuments and things. So I guess, so it'sthings like that that are gonna, that are filtering in. Mitchell came up withyesterday, and John Dean analyzed verycarefully last night and concludes, concurs now with Mitchell's recommendation that the only way to solve this, and we're set upbeautifully to do it, ah, in that andthat...the only network that paid any attention to it last night was NBC...theydid a massive story on the Cuban...PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:thing. PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:That the way to handle this now is for us tohave Walters call Pat Gray and just say,"Stay the hell out of this...this is ah,business here we don't want you to go any further on it." That's not an unusual development,...PRESIDENT:Um huh.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM4HALDEMAN:...and, uh, that would take care of it.PRESIDENT:What about Pat Gray, ah, you mean he doesn'twant to?HALDEMAN:Pat does want to. He doesn't know how to,and he doesn't have, he doesn't have any basis for doing it. Given this, he willthen have the basis. He'll call Mark Feltin, and the two of them ...and Mark Felt wants to cooperate because...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:he's ambitious...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Ah, he'll call him in and say, "We've gotthe signal from across the river to, to putthe hold on this." And that will fit rather well because the FBI agents who are working the case, at this point, feel that's what itis. This is CIA.PRESIDENT:But they've traced the money to 'em. HALDEMAN:Well they have, they've traced to a name,but they haven't gotten to the guy yet.PRESIDENT:Would it be somebody here?HALDEMAN:Ken Dahlberg. PRESIDENT:Who the hell is Ken Dahlberg?HALDEMAN:He's ah, he gave $25,000 in Minnesota andah, the check went directly in to this, to this guy Barker.PRESIDENT:Maybe he's a ...bum.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM5PRESIDENT:He didn't get this from the committeethough, from Stans.HALDEMAN:Yeah. It is. It is. It's directlytraceable and there's some more through someTexas people in--that went to the Mexican bank which they can also trace to theMexican bank...they'll get their namestoday. And pause)PRESIDENT:Well, I mean, ah, there's no way... I'm justthinking if they don't cooperate, what dothey say? They they, they were approachedby the Cubans. That's what Dahlberg has to say, the Texans too. Is that the idea?HALDEMAN:Well, if they will. But then we're relyingon more and more people all the time. That's the problem. And ah, they'll stop if we could, if we take this other step.PRESIDENT:All right. Fine.HALDEMAN:And, and they seem to feel the thing to dois get them to stop?PRESIDENT:Right, fine.HALDEMAN:They say the only way to do that is fromWhite House instructions. And it's got to be to Helms and, ah, what's his name...?Walters.PRESIDENT:Walters. HALDEMAN:And the proposal would be that Ehrlichman(coughs) and I call them inPRESIDENT:All right, fine.HALDEMAN:and say, ah...JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM6PRESIDENT:How do you call him in, I mean you just,well, we protected Helms from one hell of a lot of things.HALDEMAN:That's what Ehrlichman says.PRESIDENT:Of course, this is a, this is a Hunt, youwill-that will uncover a lot of things. Youopen that scab there's a hell of a lot ofthings and that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further. This involves these Cubans,Hunt, and a lot of hanky-panky that we havenothing to do with ourselves. Well what the hell, did Mitchell know about this thing toany much of a degree?HALDEMAN:I think so. I don 't think he knew thedetails, but I think he knew.PRESIDENT:He didn't know how it was going to behandled though, with Dahlberg and the Texansand so forth? Well who was the asshole that did? (Unintelligible) Is it Liddy? Is that the fellow? He must be a little nuts.HALDEMAN:He is.PRESIDENT:I mean he just isn't well screwed on is he?Isn't that the problem?HALDEMAN:No, but he was under pressure, apparently,to get more information, and as he got more pressure, he pushed the people harder to move harder on...PRESIDENT:Pressure from Mitchell?HALDEMAN:Apparently. PRESIDENT:Oh, Mitchell, Mitchell was at the point thatyou made on this, that exactly what I needfrom you is on the--HALDEMAN:Gemstone, yeah.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM7PRESIDENT:All right, fine, I understand it all. Wewon't second-guess Mitchell and the rest. Thank God it wasn't Colson.HALDEMAN:The FBI interviewed Colson yesterday. Theydetermined that would be a good thing to do.PRESIDENT:Um hum.HALDEMAN:Ah, to have him take a...PRESIDENT:Um hum. HALDEMAN:An interrogation, which he did, and that,the FBI guys working the case had concludedthat there were one or two possibilities,one, that this was a White House, they don't think that there is anything at the ElectionCommittee, they think it was either a WhiteHouse operation and they had some obscure reasons for it, non political,...PRESIDENT:Uh huh.HALDEMAN:or it was a...PRESIDENT:Cuban thing- HALDEMAN:Cubans and the CIA. And after theirinterrogation of, of...PRESIDENT:Colson.HALDEMAN:Colson, yesterday, they concluded it was notthe White House, but are now convinced it isa CIA thing, so the CIA turn off would...PRESIDENT:Well, not sure of their analysis, I'm notgoing to get that involved. I'm (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:No, sir. We don't want you to.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 to 11:39 AM8 (repl. 10/28/74)PRESIDENT:You call them in.PRESIDENT:Good. Good deal! Play it tough. That's theway they play it and that's the way we aregoing to play it.HALDEMAN:O.K. We'll do it. PRESIDENT:Yeah, when I saw that news summary item, Iof course knew it was a bunch of crap, but Ithought ah, well it's good to have them off on this wild hair thing because when they start bugging us, which they have, we'llknow our little boys will not know how tohandle it. I hope they will though. You never know. Maybe, you think about it.Good!HALDEMAN:Mosbacher has resigned. PRESIDENT:Oh yeah? HALDEMAN:As we expected he would.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:He's going back to private life(unintelligible) Do you want to sign this or should I send it to Rose?PRESIDENT:Ah, yeah (scratching noise)HALDEMAN:Do you want to release it? PRESIDENT:O.K. Great. Good job, Bob.HALDEMAN:Kissinger?PRESIDENT:Huh? That's a joke. HALDEMAN:Is it? Ah, O.K.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM16PRESIDENT:I don't know, maybe it isn't worth going outand talking (unintelligible) Maybe it is.HALDEMAN:Well, it's a close call. Ah, Ehrlichmanthough you'd, you probably, he, he...PRESIDENT:What? HALDEMAN:Well, he said you probably didn't need it.He didn't think you should, now at all. Hesaid he felt fine doing it.PRESIDENT:He did? The question, the point is, does hethink everybody is going to understand aboutthe bussing?HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:And, ah, well Lonzo says no.HALDEMAN:Well, this, the fact is somewhere inbetween, I think, because I think that is missing some...PRESIDENT:Well, if the fact is somewhere in between,we better do it.HALDEMAN:Yeah, I think Mitchell says, "Hell yes.Anything we can hit on at anytime we get the chance...and we've got a reason for doingit... do it."********** PRESIDENT:When you get in these people when you...getthese people in, say: "Look, the problem isthat this will open the whole, the whole Bay of Pigs thing, and the President just feels that" ah, without going into the details...don't, don't lie to them to the extent tosay there is no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre,without getting into it, "the Presidentbelieves that it is going to open the whole Bay of Pigs thing up again. And, ah because these people are plugging for, for keeps andthat they should call the FBI in and saythat we wish for the country, don't go any further into this case", period!JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10 04 TO 11:39 AM17HALDEMAN:OKPRESIDENT:That's the way to put it, do it straight(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Get more done for our cause by theopposition than by us at this point.PRESIDENT:You think so?HALDEMAN:I think so, yeah.********** PRESIDENT:Still (unintelligible) moves(unintelligible)very close election(unintelligible) he keeps saying if he movesa little-HALDEMAN:They're all... that's the whole thing. TheWashington Post said it in it's leadeditorial today. Another "McGovern's got to change his position," and that that would be a good thing, that's constructive. Ah, thewhite wash for change.PRESIDENT:Post prints the news so they'll say that isperfectly all right.HALDEMAN:Cause then they are saying...on the otherhand... that maybe we're not so smart. Wehave to admire the progress he's made on the basis of the position he's taken and maybehe's right and we're wrong.PRESIDENT:To be very (unintelligible) (laughs). HALDEMAN:Sitting in Miami played into our hand alittle bit.PRESIDENT:No.HALDEMAN:They, ah eliminated their law prohibitingmale homosexuals from wearing femaleclothing, now the boys can all put on theirdresses... so the gay lib is going to turn out 6,000 fags to (laughs).
