TO 10:12 A.M.PRESIDENT:Well, what I wanted to say was this uh,other thing is that (unintelligible) counselor. Let's just let it dangletomorrow, I don't know and uh, if nothing isgonna (unintelligible) for a week. I thought, or (unintelligible) I don't have any other persons...EHRLICHMAN:I, I...PRESIDENT: ...around. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, I don't, I don't have anyone really tosuggest to you. We may have somebody tuckedaway in a...PRESIDENT:Well, I'm gonna have to get a counselor inanother department.EHRLICHMAN:In a department that we could bring over.Now this Herb guy for instance, in transportation by the name of Bar, who's wasted there.PRESIDENT: Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Uh and there are two or three others likethat. And yet...PRESIDENT:Could we get one of those?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sure we could. PRESIDENT:What do you do with a Fielding, for example?Fielding is uh, uh...EHRLICHMAN:Fielding can work for the new man andprovide continuity. He's really not of the sector, and uh, Fielding...PRESIDENT:What we have to do (unintelligible) Ibelieve (unintelligible)APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.2EHRLICHMAN:I'd like to have you meet him anyway, anduh...PRESIDENT:Well, I don&#8482;t...EHRLICHMAN:Okay, okay. PRESIDENT:I'll keep him as a good lawyer.EHRLICHMAN:Well, he's not only a good lawyer, he's asuperb young (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I don't want to see the lawyer. EHRLICHMAN:An,'-right'. I will see him.PRESIDENT:When you have the time, come over and askhim if he'll be counsel to the White House.HALDEMAN:The understanding is that he should moveinto the counsel's role with noresponsibility direct or indirect in any way or anything relating to the Watergate case at all.PRESIDENT:Well then, who's gonna take that?HALDEMAN:Dean oughta be pulled out of that, too. PRESIDENT:That's right. Who's gonna handle Watergate? HALDEMAN:I don't think anybody in the White Housecounsel officeEHRLICHMAN:Well, the President's gotta have somebody... PRESIDENT:Somebody to assert privilege.EHRLICHMAN:...who is, one asserting privilege, two, whois riding along as a repository of information.PRESIDENT: Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And who can handle things like subpoenasbeing delivered over here.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.3EHRLICHMAN:Well, I tell you I, uh, hesitate torecommend Bark-.PRESIDENT:Yeah, because he managed...EHRLICHMAN:He's gotten so emotional about this wholething, uh, what we really need a cool,collected guy.PRESIDENT:Well, let Mark do it. EHRLICHMAN:I think he could. HALDEMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:In other words, uh, it doesn't matter in(unintelligible) case. We, we run--we, uh--sort of a delicate thing--we could takea (unintelligible) course around thecommittee, it's true. But...HALDEMAN:My problem, my problem is having(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:My thought is, darn it ought to continue toprepare the Ervin Committee proceedings.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:And that should be his responsibility.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, and I think he'll do a good job of itbecause he'll have uh, television in the PRsense and so on.PRESIDENT:Right. Okay. The other thing that occursto me is that, uh, once these, this kind of story gets billed (unintelligible) JackAnderson has a column that everybody else(unintelligible) and so forth and so on. I guess, I just dread, frankly, thepossibility of their feeding on itself tothe point (unintelligible) where (unintelligible) reasonably all right with you is in, in one column. Anderson(unintelligible). But in the end, you know,it's a question of their view on the God damned thing.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.4EHRLICHMAN:What...PRESIDENT:And uh, I, I just, I% not speaking just fromthe standpoint of, uh, I mean I, it justirritates me when people like Garment andothers come in here and say, the hell with thepeople, the Presidency is bigger and so forth. They can't, you can't separate the Presidencyfrom (unintelligible) the people, the loyalpeople and I will not do it, God damn it.Remember, I--often told you that Eisenhowersaid (unintelligible) and basically you folksdidn't do a God.damn thing. It happens, uh,at least (unintelligible) a small way (unintelligible) didn't mean to do anythingbad. You know what I mean. Well now, thething I am concerned about, though, looking atit coldly from-a PR standpoint, from yourstandpoint, I think we've got to figure thatI've just, let's just not let the day come,that uh, when uh, the Grand Jury as a resultuh, the Grand Jury sends us and now will giveus twelve hours notice, let's suppose we get twelve hours notice (unintelligible). IsMagruder before the Grand Jury today?HALDEMAN:We don't know, the Post says so. Well, weapparently can't find out if they can'tPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) before the Grand Jury wasbecause (unintelligible). Well, I can gethold of Petersen. I think the least I could do is to get him in and lay out this wholebusiness.HALDEMAN:I just wonder if that would be good before wemeet with our lawyers. Yes. And if we haveno lawyers (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Yeah, maybe I'll try. (Unintelligible) I'mgonna level about the national security stuffwhat I'm going to say is you know the Bureau.Anyway, you know that Edgar had very, very close ties with, with Marx people, you knowthey didn't want to investigate.the Ellsbergthing. Under the circumstances we had nochoice-but to go aheadAPRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.5PRESIDENT:and do it in the White.House. We did(CONT.)our best, and finally Hoover did take overthe case by Mitchell's direct orders.EHRLICHMAN:You will find in the file an, an admonitionto Hoover from here and I don't know if itwas you personally, or me , or who, Kroghmaybe, that this was to be handled as a principal case. He had laid back for months and months and months and refused to let hisagents get into it.PRESIDENT:That's right, so we couldn't use the agents,we couldn't use the (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Well, he was, he was very tender about howagents would be used in this case.PRESIDENT:Because of the, because of the Marx (unin.telligible).EHRLICHMAN:And so certain rather routine investigatoryefforts were conducted from here.PRESIDENT:That's right, because it involved nationalsecurity...EHRLICHMAN:This one, this one was apparently in excess.PRESIDENT: Yes. EHRLICHMAN:But in the context of how the Bureauworks...PRESIDENT:The Bureau... EHRLICHMAN:...they might have done the same damn thing. PRESIDENT:Yeah. (Unintelligible) the situation isthere. The thing is that we, I think we'regetting to the point where we (unintelligible). I don't know what youtalked about at the breakfast and so forth(unintelligible) but at least we can think about it.EHRLICHMAN:Sure and uh, timing uh, is out of our handsin a way, but uh, I, I would hope that wecan let these fellows have a run at this today.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.6PRESIDENT:Oh yes.EHRLICHMAN:And uh...PRESIDENT:Yes,yes, oh I didn't mean, I didn't mean to doit today, this morning, I'm simply saying thatI, that I,.don't want it to catch up with usmaybe.,.like tomorrow night or something (unintelligible) just get the son-of-a-bitchuh, uh, unplugged so that uh, you know, we,you talk; in terms of persons and I said,let's seperate uh, the, the innocent people,Mitchell and,Magruder, well in a sense they'vebeen nailed, Mitchell and Magruder., in thepublic mind, and in a sense, too, they may have Mitchell and Magruder and then they getHaldeman and Ehrlichman and splash it prettyhard. You could argue another way, from thePR standpoint, you could say Haldeman andEhrlichman by God stepped out in front andsaid, "Well we're, we are not, we're not goingto allow the White House to be involved inthis, we're gonna fight this battle, we'regonna fight it in uh, protection of some people, that is, uh, we totally disapproved ofthis, we had no knowledge of it--in otherwords, I'd slap that on them, and I would say(unintelligible) under the circumstances it.'sessential to fight this battle, let me tellyou that, my last definition. We want tohandle the PR thing right. Also, you've got to fight, both of you, all the way with yourlawyers using every legal device there is toavoid the prosecution. I, I think it can bedone, and I, as I, I think both of you can doit. Uh, uh, they, they have one hell of acase to prove. You know what I mean? So onthat score let's see where we stand. (Pause)Well, shall I (unintelligible). Did you wantto say something, Bob?HALDEMAN:Well, I was just gonna, I think it wasinteresting, cause Henry called this morning,uh (unintelligible) to make his point toAPRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.7HALDEMAN:me about uh, what his view was. He makes(CONT.)basically the same, same point that, that,uh, if we are on a path where we are goingto be nibbledPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:&#8211;or, or, in one stroke, or nibbling bynibbling, we ultimately are on a path of, of destruction in other words where they get to--just what you're saying.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...You're getting to the point where youhave to go anyway, that we should move aheadof that on a positive basis and, and fightit externally. But then he said, "Don't take that step until you're totally convinced that the other result isinevitable. As long as there is still achance that you can still stay ahead of the other, the White House is gonna be badly hurt.&#64258; I think this is true although maybeI'm not being objective. I think thePresident is going to be badly hurt by our stepping out.PRESIDENT:I agree. Well, the President's been badlyhurt (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Well, I'm not sure yet. You see, we'reoverreacting to a lot of that(unintelligible). You look at what's herenow, we've been badly hurt by some-.people that have badly served you; what you've gotto decide is where the line is drawn, who'sbadly served you and who didn't.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:If I step out, my position has got to be,and I've got a very good public case, that,that that you and I, and then I'll transfer it to me, were badly served by a number ofpeople. I&#8482;m not sure yet even who they allare.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.8PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:And as I said to Henry,,I can't tell you,Henry...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Magruder. HALDEMAN:I can't, I can't tellPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) you John?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, I think, that's, that's; the, the main,the main, and Magruder really (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(unintelligible) Mitchell and Dean.EHRLICHMAN:Mitchell and Dean. PRESIDENT:Mitchell and Dean.HALDEMAN:It was the principals that you were(unintelligible) served by.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) onto it, yeah. HALDEMAN:Magruder, what's Magruder--was doing whatpeople pressued him into doing.PRESIDENT:Well, I suppose, I suppose you know thatuh-- HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) Attorney General. PRESIDENT:We were all, we were all sitting thereandthere was the campaign. We said, "What thehell else can we do.&#64258; I guess we all sort of said, "Well Christ, that's it."HALDEMAN:Yes, but the p9int is through all of that, Idid not know, and you did not know, and I don't know today, and I don't believe you do really, what happened in the Watergate case.PRESIDENT:No, I don't.HALDEMAN:I would not be willing to write out ascenario that said I knew this is the case.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.9PRESIDENT:I wouldn't, either.HALDEMAN:Cause I don't know.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) well, the question I wantto (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:And the report I gave you starts out saying,"I'm not sure, but this is my, this is myconclusion based on three weeks of intensive interrogation of fifteen people."HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) back to the beginning thatthe position I was in, and I would feel I'mentitled to,PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...to do anything as a result of an opinion.I can't act responsibly unless I know that...PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:I don't know where Colson is yet. I thinkthat remains to be seen.EHRLICHMAN:Colson's trying to stay very close to you.He's doing his best, and he's calling everyday, and he wants to come over and see metoday, and so on and so forth.PRESIDENT:He wants to talk to me at this point.EHRLICHMAN:Right. But I mean he's trying to be, ishe's trying (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Uh, interesting thing that you shouldremember that I forgot and dredged up in myrecords last night. Richard Kleindienst was in Los Angeles when we get to San Clemente.PRESIDENT:This year?APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.10EHRLICHMAN:This last trip. And we had him come down,and he had a private meeting with you in SanClemente on about the 20, no, on about the31st of March. We flew out the 30th, he came down early in the morning on the 31stbefore he went to New York.HALDEMAN:Met with us EHRLICHMAN:Met with us for an hour or.so. I informedhim that you had my letter and, it uh,appointed me to get into this.PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah. EHRLICHMAN:And that Dean was out of it.PRESIDENT: Right.EHRLICHMAN:We discussed a lot of the ramifications, hethen went and had a private conversation with you. Remember I sat outside in caseyou needed me. And, so, that ought to beadded into the mix in terms of the whole sequence of events...PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:...so that you were on top of it on the 31stof March.PRESIDENT: Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And uh, that he was informed of the WhiteHouse effort.PRESIDENT:Back on the, the 31st of March, that's,that's something that I had neglected to puton my calendar (20 secondunintelligible/REMOVED). Let's face thefact. I was trying to get the God damnfacts when these cases (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:That's right.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.11HALDEMAN:Check.PRESIDENT:And I kept saying (unintelligible) GrandJury I don't know what the hell, they, Imean I've got to know.HALDEMAN:Um hum.PRESIDENT:And I said (unintelligible). I agree, Bob,that your (unintelligible) the question is uh, the question ia we have to realize that you're being driven out of your corner.(Unintelligible) Which doesn't help.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) because if I leave today Iwas driven out by being absolutely (unintelligible) it doesn't matter.EHRLICHMAN:It depends on the circumstances and, and wedon't know yet what the circumstances will be. Uh, uh, if I had to bet on Petersen'sscenario right now that Magruder will go onover to court and hang us...PRESIDENT: Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...I would, I would take odds he won't.Now, that may be born of a forlorn hope,but...PRESIDENT:Yeah. But on the other hand...EHRLICHMAN:...but uh, it's uh...PRESIDENT:Dean (unintelligible) and his lawyers areprobably jumping up and down.EHRLICHMAN:Sure they are.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Sure they are. But, but that may be troubleagain. We don't know what the circumstanceof Dean's return blast will be if there isone.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.12EHRLICHMAN:(CONT.)Uh, uh, or whether we're gonna be hurt byit. I, I'd hate to be in the position ofpaying on here&#8211;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) the President said Haldemanand Ehrlichman are willing to resign.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) let me make a case inpoint, maybe it's irrelevant but it is to me. I think we made a serious mistake in,in forcing Chapin to resign on theassumption that we had to get him out so that he wouldn't be forced out later. Wejumped ahead of the facts, and we jumpedwrong. We lost a good man, in the process we hurt a guy badly&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...in the process, and uh, served no usefulpurpose as it now develops. Whether he was here or there never made the least bit of difference now.PRESIDENT:Yeah. No.HALDEMAN:Uh, I just, naturally my own interest is atstake in, in, the next step but I, I thinkfrom the Presidency's interest, you have aquestion whether it is better served by our getting out or staying in.EHRLICHMAN:Look, you, you,?...HALDEMAN: (Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:...you... HALDEMAN: (Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:...you have to be totally comfortable withour staying...PRESIDENT:No, I'm comfortable.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.13EHRLICHMAN:Otherwise it would never, it would neverwork.PRESIDENT:No, no. Frankly, I, you know when I(unintelligible) decide an exploring the PR aspectsEHRLICHMAN:Sure,PRESIDENT:...I'm comfortable as hell. EHRLICHMAN:Sure, well PRESIDENT:Otherwise why the hell did you think I tookGarment's, uh,.advice?EHRLICHMAN:Well I understand, you know, I understand. PRESIDENT:I've been uh (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:But, I just want...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) just for the record, I'mcomfortable (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:...I just want to say again that uh...PRESIDENT:What I'm saying is that both of you are damngood on the PR side, and I just want you to think of the PR side.EHRLICHMAN:ButPRESIDENT:In terms of yourselves and in terms of us,but also in terms of, uh...EHRLICHMAN:There is a, there is a, an intangibleingredient here.PRESIDENT: Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Called quote, the President's confidence,unquote.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:Which Ziegler goes out and spinsoccasionally when he says the Presidentbacks Pat Gray on the Hill.PRESIDENT:That's right.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.14EHRLICHMAN:When you do that, you pump adrenalin intoPat Gray's future up there just through thefact that your having said that. There areother ways that you do that.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And that's by not doing things.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:And to the extent that that pumps adrenalinin with my viability or my reputation or myability to cope with the problem, it'sobviously to my interest.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:And so, that's something that I would hopewould be spent very sparingly. That in other words we, we'd be very slow in just uh, uhtossing that away.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, that's why I say I think we ought towait and see what develops here.PRESIDENT:All right.EHRLICHMAN:See what Petersen says to you this morning,see what our law-lawyers can find out, and then match them up. I suspect our lawyerswill hear one thing and you'll hear another.That's my prediction.PRESIDENT:Uh yeah, yeah. I'm sorry I have to see(unintelligible) now. So. Well" I'm notgoing to, uh (unintelligible) will you seeif you can get Henry Petersen to come over now, please? And uh, okay, uh, I'm not goingto call for you today, I'm gonna try to(unintelligible). Well, I mean uh, how many times have we said, "Well, let's take a day off from this thing, let's take a weekend."APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.15HALDEMAN:Yeah (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Then something happens. The uh, the speed(unintelligible) my problems is uh, (unintelligible) if you consider (unintelligible)the last couple of weeks that he chooses forthe last time. Anyway, the not urgent but personal things, the uh, uh, the problem wehave is that I have to solve them the (unintelligible). I, I, I, I, honestly can tellyou that I spend my resources in a verydeliberate way, and uh, and uh, you know, hemight soften. I hope (unintelligible) plays(unintelligible) follow instructions (unintelligible) horrible mess already so Iand ah, the, the period since the election,uh, the considered reorganization followed bythe by*, followed by the agony of theCongress, followed by this and so forth hasbeen extremely hard on me, and I hope, I thinkI will see it through, I can sweat it out, inthe meantime I will, I will (unintelligible)miserable (unintelligible) problem (unintelligible) stuff,RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;So uh, the problem Ihave is uh, facing the, you know, we sitaround here yesterday and talked about theeconomy and Henry will be in today to talkabout bombing South Vietnam again, and anissue that uh, (unintelligible) well, I think, but the wear and effect of that isenormous,.is enormous, and it may bedestructive, it may be, it may be fatal.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.16PRESIDENT:(CONT.)I think you should be aware of that and, uh,so I was not really kidding about any thing,and uh, I don't-know what can happen. The second point is that (unintelligible) Idon't want to be totally, I'wonder if thiswhole thing, whether you I stayed or not is not so destructive that our ability to govern will be totally destroyed--that'swhat we, that's, that's really Henry'spoint.EHRLICHMAN:I think that depends on how you handleyourself in the next few months. Uh, if youtake occasions to separate yourself from this, take occasions to condemn the wrongdoers in a way that not, not...PRESIDENT:Not (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:...faultily but uh, uh, (unintelligible,with noise) uh, if you communicate uh, uh, uh, your sentiments uh, in some way orother, as backgrounders or otherwise, uh, Ithink you can come through this rough water uh, very nicely, uh, the uh, the it'scertainly uh, but you (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Absolutely. I don't, I don't think it's,even remotely approaches being fatal. I think it's, it's one more--matter(unintelligible) you got to hang through andrise above it as you, as you do it. And uh, I understand your point, you can only do so(unintelligible) you got so much in you.PRESIDENT:Why Mitchell has set up this thing, speakout.HALDEMAN:It wouldn't make any difference if he did.EHRLICHMAN:Reston had an interesting article onMitchell yesterday where he said that, so that (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible), Oh, what did it say?APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.17EHRLICHMAN:He said that they don't understand whyMitchell doesn't come forward to stateresponsibilities. But uh, I think uh, if:,Icould, if I could say so, that if you will spend a week in Florida and not take callsand just delegate to uh, Ash, Shultz, hell,they can't wreck, the country in a week. Uh, Kissinger and Henry and really and, and just get the hell out of here. And take thelid off and don't read the papers and don'tread...PRESIDENT:Don't worry, I don't read the paper.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I mean just read, you know, you wouldbe inclined to, Bebe will say (unintelligible) the Watergate did this and that today.PRESIDENT:Bebe doesn't do that.EHRLICHMAN:Okay, great guy. But if you could justdetach yourself for a week and then come back from the mountains, so to speak, with afresh perspective on this and sit in the sunand listen to some good music and see some shows and just take a week off, uh I, I justthink you'll come back with an.entirelydifferent view of this.HALDEMAN:That's the best advice you've gotten. PRESIDENT:Thank you.EHRLICHMAN: Well...HALDEMAN:You'll have to fix your (unintelligible) butthe way you're talking now, the, theviewpoint you&#8482;re taking, is the only problemin this that isn't in-, is insurmountable, isn't surmountable, or is insurmountable.PRESIDENT:You're in a lot better frame of mind rightnow.HALDEMAN:For a damn good reason.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.18PRESIDENT:Yeah, well I'm sure that you (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:No (unintelligible) for your frame of mindand, and it shows to us, and that's somethingthat's been concerning us. And you will showit as time goes on.HALDEMAN:We're also students of your publicpresentation, and your, you do-a damn good jobto a point. But nobody, you can only go in toa certain point (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...and these people out here watch you verycarefully, and they've been given noopportunity to watch you for awhile and you ought to go through this. You've pulled awayother times when you, when you run into aproblem and you're in one now.PRESIDENT:(Sighs)HALDEMAN:The way you've dealt with them and dealt withthem well is to get out of them and out of thedoing of them for a time and working overyourself (unintelligible) in the process ofthat you may--first place, we&#8482;re assuming a set of events that we don't know is gonna takeplace. We've got to be prepared for it(unintelligible) but we don't have to, wearen't sure of the course of them yet.(Privileged material deleted)PRESIDENT:Coming to this one, I suppose that the uh,that the strongest argument that can be made from that uh, the other point of view is uh,you know what John calls "the let it all hangout" theory, and uh, they say, "Well, geewhiz, the President must be like Caesar'swife.&#64258; There ain't gonna be anybody aroundhere to do this son-of-a-bitchin' thing(unintelligible). it's hard to find anybodythat (unintelligible). They asked Rose aboutgetting money for these people.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I mean, it's really God damnhard to find people that (unintelligible).APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.19EHRLICHMAN:Right now you've got to consolidate yourgain. You gained the other day.PRESIDENT:By going out.HALDEMAN:Yeah, right. EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) this man, and he's--thepress, even the Washington Post is writinggood editorials about it. Now if you can get out the chronology of how you got into this and r-, rooted it out.PRESIDENT:Yeah. The only man that can get that out isJohn Ehrlichman.EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:And I think you&#8482;d better do it. Whatever,whatever we do, the only man, the only problem we've got there is what we do with regard to John Dean, and I think maybe JohnDean is gonna do it anyway.EHRLICHMAN:That's smart, too. PRESIDENT: Uh... EHRLICHMAN:If he, if he, if he uh...HALDEMAN:Now he may not, he may not do even--heeither will do it anyway or he won't do it anyway. It's a powerful, there are powerful forces that weigh against his doing it,so it's a good possibility he won't.PRESIDENT:The most powerful force of what he's againstdoing it is if he doesn't get immunity andhas to look for an amnesty.APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M. TO 10:12 A.M.20HALDEMAN:And Petersen is the lynch,man.PRESIDENT:That's, that's the most powerful personalfactor.EHRLICHMAN:Now, today is what, Thursday? PRESIDENT: Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Do you want this in the news magazinespecial?PRESIDENT: Sure. EHRLICHMAN:Cause I can have it in two news magazinesthen or I could have U.S. News in.PRESIDENT:No, I guess we won't do it. HALDEMAN:Uh, what are, what are the uhPRESIDENT:Uh, well...HALDEMAN:I don't think you need any uh, you need a(unintelligible) uh, you, you're mixed up now, you're on top now, let it, you, yougot, what, what equity you got, run outPRESIDENT:I, I agree. HALDEMAN:...as, as, as carefully as you can. PRESIDENT:I agree with that.HALDEMAN:You (unintelligible) a big chunk when I wentout to the press room the other day, and it bought you a lot and you're still gettingthe payoff.PRESIDENT:Hum. You know why it bought us that becausethey saw us on the sword with the blood running out.EHRLICHMAN:Well, not only that, it sells papers but uh,as yet, I think you're gonna do it.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)APRIL 19, 1973 FROM 9:31 A.M.
