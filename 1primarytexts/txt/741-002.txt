Got so God damned much(scratching noises)HALDEMAN:God damned. PRESIDENT:I understand, I just thought(unintelligible) If I do, I just buzz.HALDEMAN:Yeah. AhPRESIDENT:Good, that's a very good paper that heprepared. At least it volunteered one thingthey haven't got in there is the thing wementioned with regard to the Armed Services.HALDEMAN:I covered that with Ehrlichman who says thatcan be done and he's moving. Not only ArmedServices, but the whole government.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM2PRESIDENT:GSA? All government?HALDEMAN:All government procurement, yeah.

PRESIDENT:Well, if he gets back at 3:45, he won't behere until 4:00 or 4:30.HALDEMAN:It'll be a little after 4:00.(Unintelligible) &#8218;til approximately 5:00.PRESIDENT:Well, I have to, I'm supposed to go to CampDavid at 5:00. Rogers doesn't need a lot of time, does he?HALDEMAN:No sir.PRESIDENT:Picture?HALDEMAN:Just posing that's all. He PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:just brief - called me about it yesterdayafternoon and said I don't want to sit inthe meeting with Henry, I understand that but there may be a couple of points HenryPRESIDENT:Yeah, sure.HALDEMAN:wants me to be aware of.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible/REMOVED) call him and tellhim we'll call him as soon as Henry getshere, which will be between 4:30 and 5:00o'clock (unintelligible) Good. (Pause)JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM3HALDEMAN:okay --that's fine. Now, on theinvestigation, you know, the Democraticbreak-in thing, we're back to the--in the,the problem area because the FBI is not under control, because Gray doesn't exactlyknow how to control them, and they have,their investigation is now leading into some productive areas, because they've been able to trace the money, not through the moneyitself, but through the bank, you know,sources the banker himself. And, and it goes in some directions we don't want it togo. Ah, also there have been some things,like an informant came in off the street to the FBI in Miami, who was a photographer or has a friend who is a photographer whodevleoped some films through this guy,Barker, and the films had pictures of Democratic National Committee letter head documents and things. So I guess, so it'sthings like that that are gonna, that arefiltering in. Mitchell came up with yesterday, and John Dean analyzed verycarefully last night and concludes, concursnow with Mitchell's recommendation that the only way to solve this, and we're set up beautifully to do it, ah, in that and that...the only network that paid any attentionto it last night was NBC ...they did a massive story on the Cuban...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:thing. PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:That the way to handle this now is for us tohave Walters call Pat Gray and just say,"Stay the hell out of this ...this is ah, business here we don't want you to go anyfurther on it.&#64258; That's not an unusualdevelopment,...PRESIDENT:Um huh.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM4HALDEMAN:...and, uh, that would take care of it.PRESIDENT:What about Pat Gray, ah, you mean he doesn'twant to?HALDEMAN:Pat does want to. He doesn't know how to,and he doesn't have, he doesn't have anybasis for doing it. Given this, he willthen have the basis. He'll call Mark Felt in, and the two of them ...and Mark Felt wants to cooperate because...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:he's ambitious PRESIDENT:Yeah'.HALDEMAN:Ah, he'll call him in and say, "We've gotthe signal from across the river to, to put the hold on this.&#64258; And that will fit rather well because the FBI agents who are workingthe case, at this point, feel that's what itis. This is CIA.PRESIDENT:But they've traced the money to &#8218;em. HALDEMAN:Well they have, they've traced to a name,but they haven't gotten to the guy yet.PRESIDENT:Would it be somebody here? HALDEMAN:Ken Dahlberg.PRESIDENT:Who the hell is Ken Dahlberg?HALDEMAN:He's ah, he gave $25,000 in Minnesota andah, the check went directly in to this, to this guy Barker.PRESIDENT:Maybe he's a...bum.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM5PRESIDENT:He didn't get this from the committeethough, from Stans.HALDEMAN:Yeah. It is. It is. It's directlytraceable and there's some more through some Texas people in--that went to the Mexicanbank which they can also trace to theMexican bank ...they'll get their names today. And (pause)PRESIDENT:Well, I mean, ah, there's no way I'm justthinking if they don't cooperate, what dothey say? They they, they were approached by the Cubans. That's what Dahlberg has tosay, the Texans too. Is that the-idea?HALDEMAN:Well, if they will. But then we&#8482;re relyingon more and more people all the time. That's the problem. And ah, they'll stop if wecould, if we take this other step.PRESIDENT:All right. Fine. HALDEMAN:and they seem to feel the thing to do is getthem to stop?PRESIDENT:Right, fine.HALDEMAN:They say the only way to do that is fromWhite House instructions. And it's got tobe to Helms and, ah, what's his name?Walters.PRESIDENT:Walters. HALDEMAN:And the proposal would be that Ehrlichman(coughs) and I call them inPRESIDENT:All right, fine. HALDEMAN:and say, ah...JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM6PRESIDENT:How do you call him in, I mean you just,well, we protected Helms from one hell of alot of things.HALDEMAN:That's what Ehrlichman says. PRESIDENT:Of course, this is a, this is a Hunt, youwill--that will uncover a lot of things. Youopen that scab there's a hell of a lot of things and that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing goany further. This involves these Cubans,Hunt, and a lot of hanky-panky that we have nothing to do with ourselves. Well what thehell, did Mitchell know about this thing toany much of a degree?HALDEMAN:I think so. I don 't think he knew thedetails, but I think he knew.PRESIDENT:He didn't know how it was going to behandled though, with Dahlberg and the Texans and so forth? Well who was the asshole that did? (Unintelligible) Is it Liddy? Is thatthe fellow? He must be a little nuts.HALDEMAN:He is. PRESIDENT:I mean he just isn't well screwed on is he?Isn't that the problem?HALDEMAN:No, but he was under pressure, apparently,to get more information, and as he got more pressure, he pushed the people harder tomove harder onPRESIDENT:Pressure from Mitchell? HALDEMAN:Apparently.PRESIDENT:Oh, Mitchell, Mitchell was at the point thatyou made on this, that exactly what I need from you is on the--HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM7PRESIDENT:All right, fine, I understand it all. Wewon't second-guess Mitchell and the rest.Thank God it wasn't Colson.HALDEMAN:The FBI interviewed Colson yesterday. Theydetermined that would be a good thing to do.PRESIDENT:Um hum.HALDEMAN:Ah, to have.him take a... PRESIDENT:Um hum. HALDEMAN:An interrogation, which he did, and that,the FBI guys working the case had concludedthat thbre were one or two possibilities, one, that this was a White House, they don'tthink that there is anything at the ElectionCommittee, they think it was either a White House operation and they had some obscure reasons for it, non political,...PRESIDENT:Uh huh.HALDEMAN:or it was a... PRESIDENT:Cuban thing-- HALDEMAN:Cubans and the CIA. And after theirinterrogation of, of...PRESIDENT:Colson. HALDEMAN:Colson, yesterday, they concluded it was notthe White House, but are now convinced it isa CIA thing, so the CIA turnoff would...PRESIDENT:Well, not sure of their analysis, I'm notgoing to get that involved. I'm(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:No, sir. We don't want you to.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM8PRESIDENT:You call them in.PRESIDENT:Good. Good deal. Play it tough. That'sthe way they play it and that's the way weare going to play it.HALDEMAN:O.K. We'll do it.PRESIDENT:Yeah, when I saw that news summary item, I.of course knew it was, a bunch of crap, but I thought, ah, well it's good to have them off on this wild hair thing because whenthey start bugging us, which they have,we'll know our little boys will riot know how to handle it. I hope they will though.You never know. Maybe, you think about it.Good!HALDEMAN:Mosbacher has resigned. PRESIDENT:Oh yeah?HALDEMAN:As we.expected he would.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:He's going back to private life(Unintelligible) Do you want to sign thisor-should I send it to Rose?PRESIDENT:Ah, yeah(scratching noise) HALDEMAN:Do you want to release it?PRESIDENT:O.K. Great. Good job, Bob.HALDEMAN:Kissenger? PRESIDENT:Huh? That's a joke. HALDEMAN:Is it? Ah, O.K.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM9PRESIDENT:Whenever Mosbacher was, a came for dinners,ah, you see held have to be out thereescorting the person in and when they camethrough the receiving line, Henry always was with Mrs. Mosbacher and she'd turn and theaide would say this is Mrs. Kissinger.HALDEMAN:I see. PRESIDENT:He made a little joke. HALDEMAN:O.K.PRESIDENT:Well, good.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) Congressional guidance toget into the Mills thing at all with you.It was reported that somebody, Church metwith Mills.PRESIDENT:Big deal. I was going to ask him aboutit.--HALDEMAN:Well, what happened there is, that's true.(Clears throat) Church went to Mills.PRESIDENT:Is it pay as you go or not? HALDEMAN:Huh?PRESIDENT:Is it pay as you go or not?HALDEMAN:Well, Church says-it is, our people don'tbelieve it is. Church told Mills that hehad Long's support on adding social securityand Wilbur equivocated on the, ah, question, when Johnny Burns talked to him about whether he would support the Long/ChurchAmendment, but Long and Church tell him thatit is fully funded and our people are afraid Mills is going to go along if they put theheat on him as a partisan Democrat to saythat this would be damned helpful just before our Convention to stick to this to the, to the White House. Ah, Johnny Burns'view, he talked to Wilbur about itafterwards and this has been changed so don't be concerned about it.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM10PRESIDENT:I should call them.HALDEMAN:You should call Mansfield and you shouldtell Mansfield that Burns is going to fightthis in conference and that he will demand that it go to rules and he will demand athree-day-lay-over, which means he willcarry the conference over until July 7th, which would be, and then before they even start the action, so it will mean they haveto stay in, they can't...PRESIDENT:All right HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) democratic convention and(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Go ahead, HALDEMAN:Ah, Clark made the point that he shouldhandle this, not you and he is, is doingthis through Scott to Byrd, who is acting(unintelligible) still in the hospital. And ah, Clark's effort is going to be to kill the Church/Long Amendment. They got anothertactic which is playing with a dangerousgame. But they are thinking about, which is, if they put Social Security.on(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:They will bust it up. HALDEMAN:that they will put Revenue Sharing and H.R.1 on it and ah, really screw it up.PRESIDENT:I would. Not dangerous itself, but. Buckit up.HALDEMAN:They're playing with it, and ah, they, theyunderstand. Clark is going off with themission to kill the petition.PRESIDENT:Revenue Sharing won't kill it, but H.R. 1would.HALDEMAN:So, that's what he is off to.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM11PRESIDENT:But, boy, if the Debt Ceiling isn't passedstart firing (unintelligible) ah, governmentworkers. I really mean it, cut them off.They, they can't do this, they've got to give us that Debt Ceiling. Mills has saidthat he didn't want to do anything on theDebt Ceiling earlier. Well, it's O.K. it's O.K.HALDEMAN:Well, Burns says that he is justifying it onthe basis that they have told him that it'sfinance. Ah, Ehrlichman met with them the Republicans on Senate Finance yesterday andexplained the whole thing to them. Theyhadn't understoodPRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:the first six months financing and they arewith it now and already to go and hanging onthat defense. He feels, that they very much want, ah, the meeting with you before the recess in the Senate, finance Republicans,PRESIDENT:All right. Certainly.HALDEMAN:So, we'll do that next week. Did you getthe report that the British floated thepound last night?PRESIDENT:No, I don't think so, they have? HALDEMAN:They did. PRESIDENT:That's devaluation?HALDEMAN:Yeah. Flanigants got a report on it here.PRESIDENT:I don't care about it. HALDEMAN:You want a run down?PRESIDENT:No, I don't care. Nothing we can do aboutit.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM12HALDEMAN:Speculation run on it. He argues it showsthe wisdom of our refusal to considerconvertability until we get a new monetarysystem.PRESIDENT:Good, I think he's right. It's toocomplicated for me to get into. God damn it(unintelligible) so that's fine. I, I understand.HALDEMAN:Burns expects a five day per centdevaluation against the dollar.PRESIDENT:Yeah. O.K. Fine. Well... HALDEMAN:Burns is concerned about speculation aboutthe lira. Nothing short of it.PRESIDENT:Well, I don't give a shit about the lira,(Uninteligible)HALDEMAN:That's the substance of that.(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:How are the House guys (unintelligible)Boggs (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:All our people, are, they-think, they thinkit's a great, a great, ah...PRESIDENT:Well, ah, I hate to brag about it--thereaint a vote in it. But only George Shultzand people like that that think it's great(unintelligible). There's no votes in it, Bob. Or do you think there is?HALDEMAN:No, (unintelligible) vote (unintelligible) Ithink it's, it looks like a Nixon victory(shuffling) major piece of legislation (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:When?HALDEMAN:Not til July. But I mean, our guys analysisis that it will not going to get screwed up. The Senate will tack a little bit ofamendment on it, but not enough to matterand it can be easily resolved in Conference.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM13PRESIDENT:Well, what the hell, why not accomplish onething while we're here, but (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Maybe we will.PRESIDENT:Yep, not bad. HALDEMAN:In spite of ourselves.PRESIDENT:O.K. what else have you got that's amusingtoday?HALDEMAN:I don't know. That's it.(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Bright new shine. Huh! Oh, I meant to-dosome work before you come down.PRESIDENT:(unintelligible) good coverage?HALDEMAN:Good newspaper play lousy television playand they covered all the items, but didn't, you gotta (unintelligible) but maximum of two minutesPRESIDENT:Expected.HALDEMAN:A little-less than two minutes and surethat's all we're gonna get, one thing if you decide to do more in-office onesPRESIDENT:Remember, I. I when I came in I asked Alex,but apparently we don't have people in charge. I said MacClary's scheme was to letthem come in and take a picture--an Olliepicture but shit, what good does an Ollie picture do?JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM14HALDEMAN:Doesn't do any good.PRESIDENT:Don't know what it was, but I don't well,apparently he didn't get the work.HALDEMAN:Well, I think we ought to, we ought to trythat next time. If you want to see if itdoes us any good, and it might, let them.PRESIDENT:Well, why wasn't it done this time? HALDEMAN:I don't know. PRESIDENT:Was it raised?HALDEMAN:I don't know.PRESIDENT:Because I know you said and (unintelligible)Ollie sat back there and he was going tostart to (unintelligible) but, shit, Ollie'spictures hang there and nobody sees them except us.HALDEMAN:Now what you've got to it's really not thestills that do us any good on that.PRESIDENT:Hell, I (unintelligible) cameras(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:We've got to let them come inPRESIDENT:YeahHALDEMAN:With the lights. PRESIDENT:Well in the future, will you make a note to(unintelligible) the first, Alex, Ron orwhoever it is no Steve. I have no objection to them coming in, and taking a picture with stills, I mean with the cameras. I couldn'tagree more. I don't give a good shit aboutthe newspapers.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM15HALDEMAN:You're going to get newspaper coverageanyway.PRESIDENT:I don't see why in the hell (unintelligible)good objective playHALDEMAN:Oh, yeah.PRESIDENT:In terms of the way it was handled.HALDEMAN:As far as the news was concerned it wasdamned good.PRESIDENT:And it got across our point and it made thepoint, you know, (unintelligible). Needlessto say they sunk the bussing thing, but there was very, very little on that(unintelligible) Detroit (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Two networks covered it. PRESIDENT:We'll see what Detroit does. We hope toChrist the question isn't asked again what(unintelligible) the son of a bitch ifnecessary. Hit it again. Somebody (unintelligible) bussing thing back up again.HALDEMAN:What's happened on the bussing thing. Wegoing to get one or not? Well, no, we're out of time now (pause) O.K. (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I guess it is sort of impossible to get theword to the research people that when you say 100 words, you mean 100 words.HALDEMAN:Well, I'm surprised because this isBuchanan, and I didn't say time on this one,I said 100 words, and uh, Pat usually takes that seriously, but that one is, I have afeeling maybe what happened is that, that hemay have started short and he may have gotten into the, the editing, process, I meant you know the people, the clearanceprocess who say you have to say such andsuch, although I know what's happened. But I doubt it (noise makes it unintelligible)JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM16PRESIDENT:I don't know, maybe it isn't worth going outand talking (unintellibigle) Maybe it is.HALDEMAN:Well, it's a close call. Ah, Ehrlichmanthought you'd, you probably, he, hePRESIDENT:What?HALDEMAN:Well, he said you probably didn't need it.He didn't think you should, now at all. He said he felt fine doing it.PRESIDENT:He did? The question, the point is, does hethink everybody is going to understand aboutthe bussing?HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:And, ah, well Lonzo says no,HALDEMAN:Well, this, the fact is somewhere inbetween, I think, because I think that is missing some...PRESIDENT:Well, if the fact is somewhere in between,we better do it.HALDEMAN:Yeah, I think Mitchell says, "Hell yes.Anything we can hit on at anytime we get thechance...and we've got a reason for doingit...do it.&#64258;PRESIDENT:When you get in these people...when you getthese people in, say: "Look, the problem isthat this will open the whole, the whole Bay of Pigs thing, and the President just feels that" ah, without going into thedetails...don't, don't lie to them to theextent to say there is no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors,bizarre, without getting into it, "thePresident believes that it is going to open the whole Bay of Pigs thing up again. And, ah because these people are plugging for,for keeps and that they should call the FBIin and say that we wish for the country, don't go any further into this case",period!JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM17HALDEMAN:OKPRESIDENT:That's the way to put it, do it straight.(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Get more done for our cause by theopposition than by us at this point.PRESIDENT:You think so?HALDEMAN:I think so, yeah.PRESIDENT:Still (unintelligible/REMOVED) moves(unintelligible) very close election(unintelligible) he keeps saying if he movesa-little-HALDEMAN:They're all...that's the whole thing. TheWashington Post said it in it's leadeditorial today. Another "McGovern's got to change his position," and that that would be a good thing, that's constructive. Ah, thewhite wash for change.PRESIDENT:Post prints the news so they'll say that isperfectly all right.HALDEMAN:Cause then they are saying...on the otherhand...that maybe we're not so smart. Wehave to admire the progress he's made on the basis of the position he's taken and maybehe's right and we're wrong.PRESIDENT:To be very (unintelligible/REMOVED)(laughs).HALDEMAN:Sitting in Miami played into our hand alittle bit.PRESIDENT:No. HALDEMAN:They, ah eliminated their law prohibitingmale homosexuals from wearing femaleclothing, now the boys can all put on their dresses so the gay lib is going to turn out 6,000, fags to (laughs). I hope they(unintelligible) them.PRESIDENT:How did they (unintelligible)JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM18HALDEMAN:I heard...I think...PRESIDENT:They sure test the effect of the writingpress. I think, I think it was still goodto have it in the papers, but, but let's...perfectly...from another standpoint,let's just say look, "Because people tryingand any other God damned reason, I just don't want to go out there (unintelligible) what better way to spend my time than totake off two afternoons or whatever it wasto prepare for an in-office press conference." Don't you agree?HALDEMAN:That's, that's the best--PRESIDENT:Otherwise I spend, I spend an hour, ah,whatever it was...45 minutes or so with television executives (unintelligible) allin and outs (unintelligible). "Look, wehave no right to ask the President anything (unintelligible) biased.&#64258; (Unintelligible) says I'm going to raise hell with thenetworks. Agree? And look, you've just notgot to let Klein ever set up a meeting again. He just doesn't have his headscrewed on tight. (unintelligible) You knowwhat I mean. He just opens it up and sits there with eggs on his face. He's just not our guy at all is he?HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:Absolutely, totally, unorganized. HALDEMAN:He's a very nice guy.PRESIDENT:People love him but God damned is heunorganized.HALDEMAN:That's right, he's not. PRESIDENT:But don't you agree that, that's worth doingand that it's kind of satisfying.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM19HALDEMAN:Sure. And as you point out there's somefringe benefits with, with going through thethings is a good exercise for you...PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:In the sense of getting caught up on certainitems...PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:It's a good exercise for the troops inhaving to figure out what the problems areand what the answers are to them.PRESIDENT:Three or four things. Ah, Pat, Pat, raisedthe point last night that probably she andthe girls ought to stay in a hotel on MiamiBeach. First she says the moment they get the helicopter and get off and so forth, it destroys their hair and so forth. And ofcourse, that is true, even though, you turnthem off and turn them on so forth and so on. Ah the second point here is.HADLEMAN:Could drive over...PRESIDENT:Well, the point is, I want to check withDean to be sure what the driving time is. If the driving time with traffic is going to beup to an hour...HALDEMAN:Oh no. PRESIDENT:With the traffic... HALDEMAN:But they have an escort.PRESIDENT:How long would it take?JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM20HALDEMAN:Half an hour. Less than half an hour. Youcan make it easily in a half hour without anescort and they would and, they should havean escort. They should arrive with...and they may not like it..it may bother them alittle, but that's what people expect...andyou know at the Convention, Christ, every county sheriff has...PRESIDENT:She has another point though which I thinkwill please everybody concerned. She says,"Now look. You go there". She says as far as she was concerned, she would bedelighted, the girls would be delighted toevery reception everything that they have there. They want to be busy. They want to do things and they want to be useful. Ofcourse, as you know, our primary aim is tosee that they are on television, when they come into the halls for now, coming into the halls, you see, they may not be shooting thehall at that time, they're not planning ontelevision. But my point is, I think it would be really great if they did thedelegations of the big states. Just to stopin, you know (unintelligible). Each girl and so forth can do them separately.HALDEMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) The second thing is just goby and say hello, and they'll, they'll do the handshakers (unintelligible) you knowwhich would be in our interest. You know.HALDEMAN:Well, the big point is, there's, there'sseveral major functions that they may want to tie that into.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM21HALDEMAN:There's a strong.view on the part of some ofour strategists that we should be damnedcareful not to overluse them and cheapenthem. That they should...there is a celebrity value you can lose, by rubbing onthem too much.PRESIDENT:I couldn't agree more. HALDEMAN:And so we have to (unintelligible) theireagerness to participate should not overridea need...PRESIDENT:Calfifornia delegation (unintelligible)son-of-a-bitches, think I'm here. I mean weI re going to have that whole bunch in.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:You understand...they're willing. Have themdo things that will do the important thingsand so forth, and so on.HALDEMAN:There's the question. Like the Sunday nightthey have the gala, whether they should go to that...now-at least the girls should gowith their husbands. I think I ought to gotoo.PRESIDENT:Yep. You know.HALDEMAN:The question is, whether Pat...on thoughtthat was raised was that if the girls and their husbands go down on Sunday and Pat wait and come down with you on Tuesday. Ithink Pat should go down and should be therecause they'll have the Salute all over.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:I would rather.PRESIDENT:Okay.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM22HALDEMAN:She should arrive separately. I think sheshould arrive with the girls. Anotherthought was to have the girls arrive Sunday,Pat arrives Monday and you arrive Tuesday. I think you're overdoing your arrivals. Just abit.PRESIDENT:No, no, no. She arrives with the girls andthey...they should go. I agree.HALDEMAN:But I don't think you have to be there untilTuesday.PRESIDENT:I don't want to go near the God damned placeuntil Tuesday. I don't want to be near it.I've got the arrival planned(unintelligible) my arrival of, ahHALDEMAN:Now, we're going to do, unless you have someobjection. I think, we should do yourarrival at Miami International, not at aHomestead.PRESIDENT:Yes, I agree. HALDEMAN:Ah, we can crank up a hell of an arrivalthing.PRESIDENT:Alright.(Fifteen second pause)PRESIDENT:I want to make a suggestion, is for you ah,and perhaps, ah Colson probably (unintelligible). I was thumbing through the, ah last chapters of Six Crisis lastnight, and I also read the (unintelligible)chapters (unintelligible) Warm up to it and it makes a lot of fascinating reading. Alsoreminds you of a hell of a lot of thingsthat happened in the campaign press you know, election eve coverage, the (unintelligible) etc. etc.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM23HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:So on and so on. I want you to reread it,and I want Colson to read it, and anybodyelse.HALDEMAN:O.K.PRESIDENT:And anybody else in the campaign. Getcopies of the book and give it to each of them. Say I want them to read it and have it in mind. Give it to whoever you can.HALDEMAN:O.K. Sure will.PRESIDENT:Actually, the book I must say reads awfullywell...have to look at history(unintelligible) I want to talk to you moreabout that later in terms of what it tells us about what our campaign should be like.HALDEMAN:O.K.PRESIDENT:In other words (unintelligible) the mediaand so forth to that to a great extent, is responsible for what happened to Humphrey closing the gap in '68. In nineteen-ifthat's true, it did not apply in 1960. Themedia was just as bad as it was (unintelligible) little, little, Kennedy gotbad only within the last two weeks. Butnevertheless in 1960 we ran...HALDEMAN:It was a dead heat. PRESIDENT:...all the way through the campaign, and itnever changed. Clearly, it may be...it maybe that our as you read this you'll realize how intensive our campaign was...how much wedid on television, you know. We didn'thave--We had only one telethon at the end. It may be that our &#8482;60 campaign was extremely much more effectiveJUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM24PRESIDENT:and it may be too, that we misjudged thedates. You read it through and particularlyread the newspaper analysis and see what Imean. I mean, it's, it's...even realizing '68 was much better organized.HALDEMAN:Um hum.PRESIDENT:It may be we did a better job in &#8218;60. Itjust may be. It may tell us something. Anyway, would you check it over?HALDEMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) check another thing.(unintelligible) Moscow worked out the bookand Chuck Lichtenstein (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:He was, I'm not sure if he still is. PRESIDENT:Could you find out from him what chapters ofthe book he worked on. Ah, I didn't Idon't, Moscow worked on the heart attackthing. I did most of the dictating on the last two, but I've been curious. I know, I know Lichtenstein worked on the one thing,but could you find out which chapters heworked on. Also find out where Moscow is what's become of him...what&#8482;s he's doing inten years. (unintelligible) we really oughtto say hello to him (unintelligible) and we might find it useful for our purposes, future, despite the agony and all that.You'll find this extremely interesting, read(unintelligible/REMOVED).HALDEMAN:I've read, read that a number of times(unintelligible) different context(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Ah, I would say another ting...Bud Brown(unintelligible) on my (unintelligible) didyou read it? (Unintelligible) candidates.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM25PRESIDENT:I don't know who all you discussed thatwith. Maybe it's not been handled at a highenough level. Who did you discuss thatwith? (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:MacGregor and Mitchell.PRESIDENT:Huh?HALDEMAN:MacGregor and Mitchell, that's all. PRESIDENT:Yep. (Unintelligible) I don't mind the time...the problem that I have with it is that Ido not want to have pictures with candidatesthat are running with or with Democrats...or against Democrats that may either be silentor, or might be for US. On the other hand,all sophisticated Democratic candidates you understand the God damned candidates (unintelligible) they gotta get a picturewith the President. The way to have thepictures which the candidate-this would be a very clever thing, is to call both Democrats...the good Southern Democrats andthose few like Delaney who did have apicture with me, see, and then call them up and say look this school came on and theytook a picture and may be the Presidentwants you to know if you would like a picture, if you would like to come down to the office, you know, you, you can have apicture taken that you are welcome to use.How does that sound to you as a cover? Let me say this. I'm not ...I'm not...I thinkthat getting to the candidates out therethat are very enthusiastic and so forth may help us a bit. If the candidates run too far behind you, it drags you too much.HALDEMAN:Yeah. That's right.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM26PRESIDENT:On the, on the other side, I don't thinkit's going to hurt you particularly, I mean,ah, if you always (unintelligible) there'ssome quality but, ahHALDEMAN:Oh, yeah, but they aren't going to(unintelligible)HALDEMAN and PRESIDENT:(Conversing together, unintelligible.) PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) quite candid with you. Ithink when I ran in '46, remember I wouldhave gotten on my hands and knees for a picture with Harold Stassen and, you know,gave the whole story. But we oughta try todo what we can (unintelligible) in the House or do as well as we can, and in the Senate.HALDEMAN:Well to have our loyalists feel that we'redoing...PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:That's the short end of the thing. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) and I'll be glad to do itnext week and...HALDEMAN:I think on that basis we can handle theDemocrats. Say "Look they had a picture,"and then call each one. I mean they'll haveto check this list (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Check each one who's a friend and say lookwe got this, if you'd like, the Presidentwants to know if you'd like a picture withhim, you know, this is not on a basis of support...See?HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:See, tell &#8218;em not going to make anystatement, just say I'm not going to make any statement. They have, they have apicture, he'd be glad to have a picture.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM27HALDEMAN:(Unintelligble) Good, good.PRESIDENT:That's right. Be glad to if you like, butit's up to you and so forth(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:You did the Democrats in here. Do the, youdid the, would you do a, would you do theRepub-, do a different picture so that, in turn you don't always get the same full shot.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Another point I was going to mentionto you, Bob, is the situation with regard to the girls. I was talking to Pat last night.Course Tricia had trouble with(unintelligible) and she mentioned that, she mentioned, Tricia said that apparently when she was in Allentown there were 20 or 30thugs, labor thugs out booing.HALDEMAN:Hmmmm. PRESIDENT:Ah, and when she went to Boston, ah, to someart, presenting her Chinese things to theart gallery there,RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;from the press that were pretty vicious.What I mean is they came through the lineand one refused to shake. One was not withthe press. She refused to shake hands, so forth and so on. Tricia had a very personal point (unintelligible) good brain in thathead. She said first she didn't believe thatthe event that they do locally (unintelligible) understand. You know shedoes the Boys' Club, the Art Gallery and therest (unintelligible) She says the important thing is to find this type of reason to go into the damn town and to do television,which of course they do. Now she says why(unintelligible) control the place. She says in other words go in and do theRepublican group. Now sure isn't(unintelligible) to say you did the Republican group, as it is in the Allentown Boys Club? Right?JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM28PRESIDENT:But, that's the newspaper story.(unintelligible) The point is, I thinkParker has to get a little more thinking indepth, or is it Codus now who will do this sort of thing? (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:They are both working on it.PRESIDENT:What's your off-hand reaction on that, Bob?I do not want them, though, to go in and get the hell kicked out of them. Is that right?(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:There's no question, and we've really got towork at that.PRESIDENT:Yep. (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Ya, but I think, I'm not sure, if you can'tget the controlled non-political event, then I think it is better to do a political event(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:For example, now the worse thing(unintelligible) is to go to anything that has to do with the Arts.HALDEMAN:Ya, see that, it was (unintelligible) Juliegiving that time to the Museum in Jacksonville.PRESIDENT:The Arts, you know, they're Jews, they'releft wing, in other words.HALDEMAN:Stay away. PRESIDENT:Make a point.PRESIDENT:Middle America, put that word out, MiddleAmerican type of people, do light reading, auxiliary, do a Veterans auxiliary(unintelligible). Why the hell doesn'tParker get that kind of thing going? Most of his thingsJUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM29PRESIDENT:are elite groups except, I mean, do thecancer thing, maybe it was nice for Triciato go up and ride a bus for two hours or goout and do some God damned park in Oklahoma, that's alright, but my view is, Bob, relateit to Middle America and not the elitist,ah. Do you agree?HALDEMAN:Yep. I sure do. PRESIDENT:And, ah, I'm not critical. I think they aredoing a hell of a job.HALDEMAN:They really are. PRESIDENT:The kids are willing.HALDEMAN:But she can improve.PRESIDENT:There again, Tricia had a very good thoughton this, but let's do Middle America.HALDEMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I don't know whether Alextold you or not, but I want a Secret Service reception some time next week. I just, I just gotta know who these guys are. They andtheir wives. (Pause) Don't you think so? Imean, it's just, I really feel that they're there, that ah., I see new guys around, andJesus Christ they look so young.HALDEMAN:Well, they change them, that's one problemthat whoever you have a reception with now would be different totally (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Get 100 men then and so it's 200 and I shaketheir hands and thank them and you look (unintelligible) too (unintelligible). Theyknow a hell of a lot about us, let's makeit, friends.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM30HALDEMAN:Absolutely.PRESIDENT:I don't think there's any problem, but I justthink it's a nice.HALDEMAN:They all, you have such, that's why it's agood thing to do, cause they are friends, andthey have such overriding respect for you and your family, that aPRESIDENT:I wouldn't want the whole group, but I think(unintelligible). Third point, I would like agood telephone call list for California, butnot, not a huge book, and the kind is, thiswould be a good time where (unintelligible) Isuggest you thank the people for their support. Ah, for example, Colson had me call(unintelligible) the other day, it was theright thing to do, but here you could take,ah, the key guys that have worked, I, Iwouldn't mind calling a few very keycontributors, maybe, but we're talking aboutmagnitude of ten, very key ten.HALDEMAN:Yeah, you mean ten people?PRESIDENT:Ya. HALDEMAN:Oh, I thought you meant $10,000.PRESIDENT:No, ten, Ah, I was thinking of very key(unintelligible) people like that worked theirass off collecting money, just to say that,they people that (unintelligible) the peoplethat are doing the work, very key political(unintelligible) just to pat them on the back. I mean that means a helluva lot very keypolitical VIPs, you know, by political VIPs,ah, if you go to Harry Dent just get theSouth, you're gonna have to get a better(unintelligible). Our problem is that thereare only two men in this place that reallygive us names, plus Rose, one is Dent, theother is Colson, who know, and we just aren'tgetting them. But I mean, ah, and then editors (unintelligible) by editors and, andtelevision people, like a (unintelligible)call (unintelligible) but a fewJUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM31PRESIDENT:key editors who are just busting their assfor us where there's something to do. Butgive me a good telephone list and then Roseshould give me a few personal names, like I do a lot of things, but I called Harrisonhere today some (unintelligible) and thingsof that sort. But I think this would be a very good use of my time while I'm in California. Something I never mind doing it,you know, when I've got an hour to put myfeet up and make a few calls, don't you agree?HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:I think of the campaign, that's going to bea hell of a weapon. I think sometimes when we're here in Washington, you know,supposedly doing the business of thegovernment, that I can call people around the country, those people that will come out for us and so forth, like (unintelligible)for example, Democrats come out for us.They're going to get telephone calls from me right across the board. Any Democrat orlabor union. (Unintelligible).HALDMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Religious leaders (unintelligible) saysomething. You gotta be careful some assover in (unintelligible) check on(unintelligible) that's why you can't have Klein (unintelligible). He just doesn'treally have his head screwed on, Bob. Icould see it in that meeting yesterday. He does not.HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:He just doesn't know. He just sort ofblubbers around. I don't know how he does TV so well.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM32REEL 2 BEGINSPRESIDENT:He's, he's just sensational on that.HALDEMAN:That goes to the cool medium business again,you see, you know. This, this is, if that, what's his drawback, is really an asset(unintelligible) economics.END REEL 1PRESIDENT:If you would do this. Pat, and tell Codus,to raise (unintelligible) 30 days, so I cango to Camp David and she can go in a halfhour to Key Biscayne she might want to stay there where she's got the proper securityand not the noise and so forth and so on.That she can go in less than half hour with the escort. Do you think you can? Frankly, in Miami Beach it will take, damn near,(unintelligible), but we can arrange iteither way? Leave it to her choice.HALDEMAN:It wouldn't take as long. It wouldn't. PRESIDENT:But, leave it to her choice - she'd - it's.HALDEMAN:She'd be so miserable. If she's at MiamiBeach she's a prisoner in that hotel.PRESIDENT:Yeah. That's right. Tell her, tell herthat's fine. But it's up to her. Fairenough. I'll be anxious to see about (unintelligible) signing that stuff (unintelligible). You know, uh, it's notthe best of (unintelligible), but I supposemost of our staff (unintelligible) but that Six Crises is a goddamned good book, and thefinal story reads like a novel. That's whatthis is a novel. Uh, Caracas was fascinating. The campaian of course for anybody in politics should be a must becauseit had a lot in there of how politicians arelike. What happens after elections, and how you do things. And, of course,JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM33PRESIDENT:the Kruschev thing is a classic as of thattime. I think part of the problem you know,for example, for example, I'm just thinkingresearch people something they really missed, Jimmy Burns. Pat and I came back,she came back and she said this is Burns(unintelligible). No, she had remembered, she said she would rather give a party than (unintelligible). That's the problem as faras hiring (unintelligible) three or fourparties for 50 each, and Burns flew all the way up (unintelligible) party(unintelligible) and Jimmy Burns said,"Well, the Vice President is (unintelligible) hard for me to come, I just want you to know if you'd have won(unintelligible), but because you lost(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:That's great. PRESIDENT:...still your friend. Now, that was good.Nobody had that none of our researchers orthe rest. That would be a wonderful item to put in the statement.HALDEMAN:Is that in the book?PRESIDENT:It's in the book! HALDEMAN:Is it? PRESIDENT:Hell yes. I can definitely remember thatone. It's in the book!HALDEMAN:That's interesting. PRESIDENT:That's what I was trying to tell you. Now,Andrews, Andrews (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Let me re-read it. PRESIDENT:I (unintelligible) that I foundJUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM34PRESIDENT:(unintelligible).

ZIEGLER:But I thought, if you agreed, that I wouldnot for press purposes, but just sit in thesidePRESIDENT:Yeah. ZIEGLER:...(unintelligible) this economic thing.PRESIDENT:Sure.

ZIEGLER:Well, (unintelligible) seven.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) yesterday.ZIEGLER:You see.(PAUSE)PRESIDENT:See what I mean?HALDEMAN:Sure.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM35PRESIDENT:It's the kind of thing that I get in toastsand that sort of thing, but, but you see, Idon't think our guys do that kind of thatshould be must reading that book is crammed full crammed full crammed full, believe me,see. It would be helpful for those(unintelligible) prepare to get it. Okay. Oh, uh, can we take another second? Now, I mean, on that thing on the All Time BaseballGreats I would like to do that and, uh, ifyou could, if you could get it. Who was that?ZIEGLER:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Yeah. ZIEGLER:There's already a story at random... PRESIDENT:I saw that.ZIEGLER:indicating that you were, that you weregoing to...PRESIDENT:Four o'clock. ZIEGLER:Right.PRESIDENT:Four o'clock. Right. If you would get thatand if you would get the three or four of those. I don't all the time I'm onlyspeaking of the All Time Greats of themodern era.ZIEGLER:Right. PRESIDENT:People that I see (unintelligible)...ZIEGLER:Right.PRESIDENT:Pretty nice girls, and then get me sort of,a couple of other people (unintelligible)deserve that.ZIEGLER:Right.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 10:04 TO 11:39 AM36PRESIDENT:And, I'll (unintelligible) and I'll go downthrough the quietly where these people are(unintelligible) also get me(unintelligible) and have it on hand.ZIEGLER:So you want names?PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).ZIEGLER:You want names from me or just a list ofothers you have picked?HALDEMAN:No, just the names that have been picked(unintelligible) various people.ZIEGLER:Right.

(Unintelligible) two minutes of television.ZIEGLER:I thought he was good. I thought he gotgood play. Particularly in light of the fact that uh, there was a helluva lot ofother world news that, uh, the WashingtonPost (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Right.
