HALDEMAN:Yeah, they're so inundated with all thisside bar stuff that, you know, they lob inthese six pieces of, of, uh, (laughs)material.PRESIDENT:Look, I see this morning, says the lawyersays that we have Watergate bugging stuff.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:So. HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:The other guy on the staff wanted the legal,and apparently it was delivered before he was charged, so, uh, it was an obstructionof justice. Did he stick it out? I was justcurious as to how the hell it got out ofhere.HALDEMAN:If that applies, the lawyer cautioned Johnon, on that, uh, they have that one case onJohn Connally, that they, uh,PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...&#8482;Cept (cough) that he said there's, God,it's complex.PRESIDENT:Yeah. I know that but let me say that onthat, or far as we know about the(unintelligible) nobody here knew anythingabout it. I, I never heard about it. Have you heard anything about Haldeman's crap out?APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 8:15 TO 8:39 A.M.2HALDEMAN:No, sir.PRESIDENT:Uh, did you think Colson swears he ain'theard about--HALDEMAN:I don't know, uh, (unintelligible) sums up. PRESIDENT:Well, Dean's story is predictable.HALDEMAN:Well, I&#8482;m not really sure what Dean&#8482;s storyis. It, well, yeah, for sure that he is saying there were higher ups and lower downs also involved. He, he's determined he&#8482;s notgoing to be alone.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:And, uh, the Post modified the story 'causethey ran a---see, originally they weresaying Haldeman engineered the cover up the operation.PRESIDENT:They can't say that.HALDEMAN:Now they said Haldeman and others in theWhite House were involved in the cover-up, which at least is not quite as ...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...as, uh...PRESIDENT:That's the point about the lawyers...(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:They've been accused of trying to go intothat one with quite a summary and they said, well, it's a question of the intent to turn over the truth (unintelligible) you object?HALDEMAN:Well, if it's a question intent, then, thenthere's no problem.PRESIDENT:If you had knowledge, of course, you might,you might admit it, but you (unintelligible)They said they needed money, you said all right, turn it over to LaRue. (Unintelligible) Strachan (unintelligible)wouldn't you say-Strachan?APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 8:15 TO 8:39 A.M.3HALDEMAN:Strachan, yeah, Strachan, I would guess, hadless knowledge than I did, I mean, I thinkhe...PRESIDENT:What about the money? Did he turn it over... HALDEMAN:He turned it over, but I don't think he hadany knowledge of why he was turning it...PRESIDENT:Let me ask you about one conversation. Theonly thing that troubles me about this is my own recollection of a conversation withDean(unintelligible) that last, that what,where you were with him when he said that Bittman had stated that he needed money forDean's attorney's fees at $40,000.HALDEMAN:I think--I can't figure out when that wasand I can't find any notes on it.PRESIDENT:Were you in the room with them?HALDEMAN:I thought I was, but the meeting that youhad for, and according to your log, that you had where I was in the room with Dean, it was an hour, I mean 110 minute, 2 hourmeeting...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...with Dean, but it was in the morning.PRESIDENT:Well.HALDEMAN:I can't know why, but I distinctly have thefeeling that the meeting that I remember was in the evening and I remember discu...PRESIDENT:But you do remember talking about that, withthe...HALDEMAN:Yeah.APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 8:15 TO 8:39 A.M.4PRESIDENT:Uh, that with the, with the thing.HALDEMAN:Yeah, I do.PRESIDENT:Now, I was there. Do you remember where themillion dollars, where I said how long would it take to, uh, take it?HALDEMAN:I remember it was general discussion, youknow, kind of running out the string.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:But did Dean as well say that I said, "Well,let's go get the money?"HALDEMAN:Oh, no. I don't think so.PRESIDENT:Yeah, because basically, I was very, as Itold you, I was prepared to be of assistance. I said, "Christ, turn over any of the cash we got.&#64258; You know what I mean?HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) coverup.PRESIDENT:I, just thinking at the moment, trying tohold the line. We've got our own ducks to roll.HALDEMAN:Well, you, you may have said somethingabout, you know, well, you know when he said they had to have the money. You, you mayhave said something about, well, that weought to be able to getPRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...we ought to be able to get the money,but...PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...but then we got into the thing withrunning out the string.PRESIDENT:But--APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 8:15 TO 8:39 A.M.5HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible), you know, the, the--PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Uh, (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Basically what the issue is whether we couldget the money quite (unintelligible). Wedidn't, uh, you, uh, Dean, and uh, what,how, bow did it eventually get back to Mitchell so that he did that?HALDEMAN:I don't know.PRESIDENT:Well, Bob, you were in the mom and Mitchellwas there.HALDEMAN:But I--Mitchell wasn't there.PRESIDENT:No, but when it was discussed in youroffice. Do you remember that?HALDEMAN:My office? The only thing that wasdiscussed we were in general meeting on, onthe others, not that point, and Mitchell hada, an interrupted point and then Dean come in (unintelligible). Mitchell had a whole list of things.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) covered (unintelligible)long even there.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:We got a chance, but didn't relate to thegeneral subject, basics of it. He said to Dean, I'm not sure of the words, but ineffect, what he'd done about the...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...the Hunt thing...PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 8:15 TO 8:39 A.M.6HALDEMAN:...or that other problem.PRESIDENT:Yeah, right.HALDEMAN:Something that--it was clear to all of us,that, what he was talking about, but it was not spelled out in any detail, uh. "Whathave you done about it" and Dean looked kindof puzzled and he said, "Well, uh, I don't know.&#64258; Then, then he just kind of, like that--And, uh, Mitchell says, "Oh, I guessit's taken care of" and we just-nobody askedany more questions, or, or...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...gave any more answers. That was theextent of it and we assumed from that thing that Mitchell had it under control, uhatever he&#8482;s supposed...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) in effect Dean impartedknowledge to me among others, uh, that the, uh, Bittman, uh, had uh, you know, wanted the money. Did I...HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Two, two, two places where others, if theyhad knowledge is (unintelligible) Colsonshould have come in and said, "Well, Huntwanted money that might have meant (unintelligible) there's no problem because I handled it right.&#64258; In this case.HALDEMAN:That was, uh...PRESIDENT:You remember? HALDEMAN:...that was in January, I guess, apparentlybecause...PRESIDENT:Oh, m, no, no. Shortly after the campaign,you know, that&#8482;s what he said before Christmas, but, whatever it was...APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 8:15 TO 8:39 A.M.7HALDEMAN:But, uh, on this one I don't see that youhave any problem at all. In the firstplace, at that time you were in theinvestigation of the case. You were probing, you know, all directions witheverybody you could get...PRESIDENT:That's correct. HALDEMAN:...and everything, everything you could get,with no obligation to move in at any fixedtime, only an obligation to, to, uh, workthis thing out. Uh, the other factor in that is that, that was clearly, distinctlyas the threat was relayed, was related tonational security. Because Hunt specifically said he needed this or he was gonna spill beans on...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...on the stuff did for Ehrlichman, andthat, as you instantly knew, uh, anything he did for Ehrlichman was involved in thenational security project over here.PRESIDENT:And we couldn't pay blackmail for that. HALDEMAN:And we didn't.PRESIDENT:Well, we're talking...HALDEMAN:You didn't... PRESIDENT:We're talking about, I guess, oh, I don'tknow. I don't know how much we should betalking about any of this.HALDEMAN:I don't think Dean's gonna do that, uh, Idon't think it's going to come out at all.It's privileged conversation, that's forsure.PRESIDENT:That for sure. The reason, you see, thatI...APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 8:15 TO 8:39 A.M.8HALDEMAN:Whatever was done, it was done by Mitchell.He lobbed it down here.PRESIDENT:Right. The reason I, the reason I want tolet you know that, uh (unintelligible) what happened with Bittman, got a hold of Dean(unintelligible) the reason that strategydidn't work. The reason I want you to know, the reason I had to treat Dean, you know, as Ehrlichman, you know in the meantime wantedme to fire him on Monday because of hisresignation. You've got to remember that he has sat here and talked at great length toneabout this damn case and he wanted a reason.You know he was desperate to see what he could do. You don't agree?HALDEMAN:You were investigating him then. You weretrying to get out of him at that point--thefirst place, at that point you had no reason to believe him. Because, you now have found, was lying on various things so whatyou had, you couldn't back him on that hetold you. You could merely receive what he told you to determine and then, then checkthat out against other things.PRESIDENT:Well, we say he was lying about, in ourfairness to him we have to say (unintelligible) for us that he was doingit. 'Cause I had told him on severaloccasions, "You've sure done a hell of a job here. You've done a good job."HALDEMAN:Well--PRESIDENT:I wasn't speaking, I wasn't speaking to thejob held done on the, on raising money. I was thinking of the way he handled all...HALDEMAN:That's right. Which we thought he had, butnow you point out that there was, that he was playing a double game, apparently.APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 8:15 TO 8:39 A.M.9PRESIDENT:I think probably, (unintelligible), themoney raising. I guess we didn't know hewas doing that. Yes, I guess we did knowit.HALDEMAN:Oh, no, we knew he was doing something.PRESIDENT:We knew he was pressing on, you mean, like,for example, the activating of Kalmbach, which is, he produced you in that, right?HALDEMAN:No question about that. We told the lawyersand they have no trouble with it.PRESIDENT:They, what they just said, "That's allright. You didn't do anything."HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Could they be asked permission? Said okay.(pause) Well, the lawyers said we're gonna have to think about it over the weekend. Ithink it's just great you, John andfamilies-I want you all to move to Camp David and use it.HALDEMAN:Well, it's very nice.PRESIDENT:Use the nice one.HALDEMAN:I don't know whether that&#8482;ll-I think we justhave to see what, what we need. The firstthing (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:--is to get out of your house, if you can HALDEMAN:Yeah, yeah, well this God damned press hadme straddled there last night.PRESIDENT:Oh, shit. I don't see what--HALDEMAN:Do it every morning. But, uh, the, uh,that's no problem, that, that...PRESIDENT:Yeah, sure.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 8:15 TO 8:39 A.M.10PRESIDENT:Well, be free to go, Bob.HALDEMAN:The main thing, what I'm trying to go atthis in an orderly way, 'cause we've beenkind of dashing around...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and we&#8482;ve got to get...PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:We&#8482;ve got to perfect and solidify our legalbase...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...and then, I hope to get that done fast... PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and uh, work with these guys to get itdone...PRESIDENT:Good. HALDEMAN:...so we know exactly where we are, what ourproblems are, what our--what our strengthsare.PRESIDENT:Take them with you to Camp David. HALDEMAN:Only thing I say come up (unintelligible)Roger will come down (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:No, take him up. HALDEMAN:But, uh, we'll, uh, (unintelligible). oncethat is settled, then I want a turn totrying to, to...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)--public relations- HALDEMAN:...work a public plan out and work out allthese kinks, and, and look down the roadbecause I think we can, we can, uh...PRESIDENT:Do better.HALDEMAN:...deal with that effectively, too. And I,uh...APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 8:15 TO 8:39 A.M.11PRESIDENT:Can I ask you one thing? Could you dosomething to (unintelligible) let's get aline on this money thing. Return to sayingGod dammit, it's all right.HALDEMAN:But we have to...PRESIDENT:You've got to say that, you've got to say,"Yes, money was raised for the (unintelligible) worked for the Committee and they, they worked. They were in troubleand they were entitled to legal counsel(unintelligible) assistance.&#64258; That's what the purpose of it was.HALDEMAN:But that's why we've gotta get the legalclaims. They lawyers (noise) (unintelligible) and they've gotta figure out where there's any legal problems withthem. Just, uh, raise (noise)the question(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I'd rather be on the offensive on that.Say, if you can, just to say, "Yes, moneywas raised.&#64258; Obviously the money wasraised so why did they put it on the doorstep? Well, that's the way it was givento Mrs. Hunt. That was the way she handledit. Raised the cash for that purpose.HALDEMAN:Well, you gotta separate--in the firstplace, we, as fares I know, we were involvedin the raising of very little money, 'causeall we were held with the raising of was, was, okaying Kalmbach. And I think that wasnot very much money, I don't know.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Uh... PRESIDENT:Except...HALDEMAN:The other thing, as we were, I was Iinvolved in the moving of the 350...PRESIDENT:That's right.APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 8:15 TO 8:39 A.M.12HALDEMAN:... which was, in my view, and under adviceof counsel, worked out in order to put moneywhere it belonged. Now I sure as hell knew,and I can't argue that, uh...PRESIDENT:That they needed money.HALDEMAN:...that they needed money. That, that was away to persuade them to, to, to take this money-Work out a way of handling the receipt of this money. What they did with it, Ihaven't any idea.PRESIDENT:I'm glad Mitchell at least is having thegood sense to come clean to the(unintelligible) extent of the fact you hadknowledge, uh, the three you saw in "Time" this morning.HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:Well, he, he admitted, he did have threemeetingsHALDEMAN:Oh, really? PRESIDENT:... He's going to testify today-but that hehad turned it off...HALDEMAN:Well, then that's true. PRESIDENT:...and rejected the plan. I think you mayhave two consumate lawyers here, Dean andMagruder.HALDEMAN:Well... PRESIDENT:Magruder I'm sure.HALDEMAN:Well, except it's not your thing(unintelligible) (noise) 'cause Magruder states that press sources can still bebotched up. Magruder still has that storyof going down to Key Biscayne.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Now, there were two meetings and Mitchellknows Dean...APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 8:15 TO 8:39 A.M.13PRESIDENT:And Mgruder(unintelligible).(Noise)HALDEMAN:See, that's why Mitchell sent Liddy(unintelligible) 'cause Liddy(unintelligible)Magruder, who was atthe third meeting. The third meeting beingKey Biscayne.PRESIDENT:How does Mitchell keep quiet? HALDEMAN:Dean, Dean wasn't at that. And I think,apparently, see they had Liddy over thereyesterdayPRESIDENT:Um hum.HALDEMAN:...and he wouldn't talk.PRESIDENT:Is that right? HALDEMAN:In spite of your signal. PRESIDENT:I did my job.HALDEMAN:Your're supposed to. (laughs)PRESIDENT:And that's why Dean wanted me to get him totalk. I did my job. The U.S. Attorneys know. I'm glad I did.HALDEMAN:I'm glad you did, to. (Pause) Well, welljust step...PRESIDENT:Sure.HALDEMAN:Well, I really--we need to get the moneyback. Get out ahead of it. Get a line on it. And, uh, we need to get, I hope I can get (unintelligible) on the whole thing. Idon't know if they'll let me. Work out away to get out (unintelligible). I'd like to-with all this stuff that's busting. Now,I'd like to, sort of, just bust the wholething loose. Lay it out and then see what happens.PRESIDENT:Say that, (unintelligible) you say that, uh,the President's suggesting that you would-beperfectly willing-in other words the idea, the, uh, that nowAPRIL 20, 1973 FROM 8:15 TO 8:39 A.M.14PRESIDENT:the case(unintelligible) could knock off.(CONT.)This time give the reasons for this timebecause of this and that. Now here are thefacts.HALDEMAN:That, I've gotta say that, that, I, theseare the facts as I know them(unintelligible) my situation. I see, I used to be worried about having to be told to testify about hearsay. I'm no longerworried about that because I now find thehearsay I was given, some of it was clearly not true. In other words, even the people Iwas relying about weren't telling the truth.PRESIDENT:I, I'm not talking about that. HALDEMAN:So, I don't know--I was--all I say isI don'tknow what, what, what the facts are involvedwith this, whether I have to talk or not, I,there's no question about, about the Presidential communications.PRESIDENT:Do you feel that, uh, that clearly isdesigned to--HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) said he didn't(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Do you feel that, uh, I think still providesfor your employer, don't you?HALDEMAN:Absolutely. PRESIDENT:That's the story everyday, isn't it?HALDEMAN:Yeah, but that's there's going to be a storyeveryday and there's no point in reading...PRESIDENT:Well (unintelligible), but, uh...HALDEMAN:I know, but, but, it...PRESIDENT:You say anything about (unintelligible) HALDEMAN:It's, it's, there I was just talking toTimmons, who, uh...APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 8:15 TO 8:39 A.M.15PRESIDENT:Talked, huh?HALDEMAN:You know, we've got a good crew around here(unintelligible). Well, we, I understandyou, you wanta help.PRESIDENT:Except for (unintelligible) they all wantahelp (unintelligible).(unintelligible conversation/REMOVED)
