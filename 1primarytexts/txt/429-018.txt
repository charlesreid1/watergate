That'simportant...PRESIDENT:...to see what uh...EHRLICHMAN:...what isn't. Did he talk at all about thepurpose of that meeting? Cause I thinkthat's, that's also important.PRESIDENT:Oh, yes, yes. He said for two days hetalked about the hearings and programming the hearings and (tape noise) and getting a,getting a statement from (unintelligible)work up a statement.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, thank you, Manuel.PRESIDENT:Uh, you see (unintelligible) in other words,oh yes, he, he remembered it all. He said this was only the pre-, presentence, presentence is out in two days. But this,this was, this was a (unintelligible) sign,an agreement I'm (unintelligible) that I raise it with him. I said "No. Then, the hell with Dean.&#64258; But I couldn't talk aboutit then. I, uh, said, "You listen to what"(unintelligible) uh, personally, I suppose (unintelligible) Colson about this business(unintelligible) Kalmbach or something likethat. I think that that was where it came to you.EHRLICHMAN:Came to Haldeman. True?PRESIDENT:I said, uh, "Can't be (unintelligible)Kalmbach to raise money for the defendants when we're faced with that.&#64258; Right?EHRLICHMAN:Right. Question about that.PRESIDENT:La Costa after the trial is(unintelligible)...APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.4EHRLICHMAN:La Costa is just, that's that rainy weekendin uh, February.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:February the 20th or somewhere along inthere.PRESIDENT:Well, this is after the portion. (Tapenoise).EHRLICHMAN:Uh, they haven't sentenced him yet as amatter of fact.PRESIDENT:Uh, uh, my, uh, Dean, uh, the other thing isthat uh, Moore uh, recollected something about this, uh, this uh, Bittmanconversation, too. He says that Dean toldhim that Hunt, Hunt needed money before he gets sentenced. Also he told Dean, "Look, this is blackmail." So that's how that camein. So when Dean came in to see me, andraised the subject (unintelligible with tape noise) blackmail to see if I could find (unintelligible) that Bob was involved in,you know. I guess you weren't in the(unintelligible) Bob, Dean and Mitchell. Right? And Bob told me the story that hesaid that Dean asked, "What about thatmoney?&#64258; and uh, Mitchell asked.EHRLICHMAN:The Committee and Haldeman's office(unintelligible) almost in an aside.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And Dean said to Mitchell, "What about thatother matter?"PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...And Mitchell said it's taken care of.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.5PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...and (unintelligible with tape noise).PRESIDENT:I assume...EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:...I assume what happened here on that isthat Dean not getting the money here, hecalled Mitchell as quick as he could.EHRLICHMAN:Evidently, evidently. PRESIDENT:(Tape noise) Uh, Dean's whole deal ofcourse, which I've already reported to you(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:That's the only thing you'll have got, John.EHRLICHMAN:O.K. PRESIDENT:Those things--don't think that (tapedistortion) if it comes to a, the, thequestion of Dean's, Dean (unintelligible)perjury or not, (unintelligible) very, very hazy about that.EHRLICHMAN:Yes, uh, how did you leave it with him? Didyou uh...PRESIDENT:I'm not talking (unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:Oh, you aren't. O.K. Well, I, if I couldsuggest a, a point of view on La Costa...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...it is that our inability to do what youasked us to do at LaCosta, which was...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...to draft a public statement which couldbe...PRESIDENT:Right.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.6EHRLICHMAN:...put out as such...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...let in quick succession to...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...your long talks.PRESIDENT:Listen...EHRLICHMAN:Dean reported back to you, but it was a, itwas a fruitless weekend.PRESIDENT:That's right. That's right.EHRLICHMAN:...and...PRESIDENT:The fact that he (unintelligible) to see me.Right.EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...and it was a fruitless weekend. Dean,Dean kept saying, "You can't say that, youcan't say that," and so forth. And uh, thatled to your talks with Dean, and that led to Dean going to Camp David.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:And then that eventually led to crackinghim.PRESIDENT:That's right. That's right.EHRLICHMAN:So it all started in the fact that...PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:...the four of us could not put together... PRESIDENT:Even this, let me say that this conversationabout this money and so forth. Uh, you'vegot to find out who's (unintelligible).APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.7EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, that's this particular(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:That's one of the things that led us toconclude that we had to move off, move off this (unintelligible). You know,(unintelligible) money. There isn't anyquestion, I suppose, that in the, in the way the whole thing is presented (unintelligible) possibly concerned with the(tape noise) knowledge of, at leastknowledge, certain knowledge of that, in Bob's case, a case of the 350 participationin, in the 350 (unintelligible) tot uh(unintelligible) tell you about that (unintelligible) again but there were a few things the law...EHRLICHMAN:Well,...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:This is where we left it with him. We feltthat if you're agreeable...PRESIDENT:Uh huh.EHRLICHMAN:...the best way to do this would be for themto go over there, talk with the prosecutors,come back.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Report to us, and then, if you areavailable, for you to talk to Mr. Wilsonconfidentially alone.PRESIDENT:Alright. EHLRICHMAN:He very much has your interest at heart...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...and he's trying to approach this fromyour standpoint...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...rather than from ours, really. Andyou'll see that.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.8PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:So, Bob and I agreed privately...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...that that would be a very desirable thingfrom your standpoint...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...to have his counsel. PRESIDENT:In other words he could, he could if he everneeded somebody to...EHRLICHMAN:He has forty years of experience in thisbusiness.PRESIDENT:He's for us.EHRLICHMAN:He's totally loyal, just totally in factavidly loyal.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:And so rather that to have the two of usstrain uh, uh, what he thinks...PRESIDENT:Let me ask you this, when is he going to seethem, (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:He's, he's there right now. He's thereright now. He expects to be here by sixo'clock.PRESIDENT:Could he see me tonight?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. He'll come back, see you tonightif you don't, uh, you get back from the boat.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:He'll come back and, and when he can beavailable to you. (tape noise) (Laughter) You wouldn't know what to do. The youngerAPRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.9EHRLICHMAN:of the two is a very steady trial man(CONT.)with a lot of experience.PRESIDENT:They're both talking to these people.EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. They both know (unintelligible). PRESIDENT:You get back and I hope you discuss this andI will discuss it with them, too. You getback with Dean if you can (unintelligible) around here. (Tape noise) this-on Moore too, and uh, and I know it's, I-know itsounds unbelievable, but I just wonder aboutthis.EHRLICHMAN:(Tape noise) to tell you about that.PRESIDENT:They don't believe it?EHRLICHMAN:They say it's a dream world, but that justcan't be.PRESIDENT:I don't agree.EHRLICHMAN:But no, do, do...PRESIDENT:I don't EHRLICHMAN:I think you ought to hear their view... PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...if it's appropriate uh, uh, their(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Dean's going to do it, as damned as anybody.EHRLICHMAN:They, they think that he has every incentiveto, and that there's no way to remove that incentive.PRESIDENT:Right.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.10EHRLICHMAN:That&#8482;s their, that's their feeling.PRESIDENT:So if he goes to jail, he's got a littleless incentive to kick, kick the President(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I think that would be (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Can anybody (unintelligible) keep him from(unintelligible) without kicking.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, uh, unless they turn up somethingdifferent down there. Now they say thatthey know Glanzer extremely well.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:And they know Silbert well...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...that they know uh, their boss and uh... PRESIDENT:So they'll find out. EHRLICHMAN:So they'll find out. I think quite a lot.PRESIDENT:Uh, if Petersen has any, any, uh, indicationof course uh, the uh...EHRLICHMAN:Now, they do not have a high opinion of himprofessionally.PRESIDENT:No, but I'd have to tell you that if he'sany indication of Glanzer and Silbert, uh-Send that to the out box please(unintelligible) girl (unintelligible) Yeah.I know. I know. But, I meant that, you gotta remember that Petersen, if this reflects the U.S. Attorney, came in withKleindienst and said they, uh, you know,came on with the, the resignation deal.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.11PRESIDENT:In their view of the Haldeman(unintelligible) .We're not going to bepanicked by any (unintelligible with tapenoise)EHRLICHMAN:That, that's right.PRESIDENT:Since you're going to talk to him in personEHRLICHMAN:That was (Unintelligible). (Unintelligible)be there at 4:30 so it's an hour, already.PRESIDENT:...possibly (unintelligible), correct?(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:He'll probably want to go on, uh, back totheir office if we haven't soaked up all daytoday here. But, I'll, I'll arrange forthem to come back and see you privately.PRESIDENT:You have told them about the LaCosta--didyou recall that the, that the(unintelligible) of money had come up atLaCosta at all or--EHRLICHMAN:I hadn't, uh... PRESIDENT:I hadn't--that's a new element.EHRLICHMAN:I had touched on it-no, what I, what I toldthem was that at various times and intervals (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) if I didn't have a presentrecollection, I still...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...You know, I don't have a recollection ofthat.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) time and intervals.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, that this subject came up in Dean'sconversation...PRESIDENT:Uh, huh.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.12EHRLICHMAN:...and that uh, uh, he would ask me, hewould ask me for advice, he would ask me...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...uh, what to do and almost invaribly... PRESIDENT:I know.EHRLICHMAN:I had no response for him.PRESIDENT:I understand. EHRLICHMAN:I just, I was helpless in that situation.The one time that I did respond was when hespecifically asked if they could useKalmbach.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And that's the only time.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:I've never been able, other than the Bittmanthing where I said, "Hell, no."PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:I've just never been able to help him. Andso it doesn't surprise me if I said uh, you know, "Get somebody else to help you, John."PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah. Why, why doesn't LaRue help, sothat we could...EHRLICHMAN:...or Rockefeller or Mitchell or uh...PRESIDENT:Dean, Dean, that uh...EHRLICHMAN:...uh, that doesn't, you know that doesn'tnonplus me.PRESIDENT:Yeah, LaRue (unintelligible) grounds ofcourse, that that was realized(unintelligible).APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.13EHRLICHMAN:John was getting increasingly desperate astime went on.PRESIDENT:Dean.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...trying to keep the lid on.EHRLICHMAN:...trying to keep the lid on.PRESIDENT:...which is a job. EHRLICHMAN:...and uh, I never could help him. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:(Tape noise) What, uh, what's a guy to say,then, about that again. Now he said that,about that being obstruction, he said thatisn't on the (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Yesterday the--That's right. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:He said that the circumstances will bedifficult to explain.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:No question about that. Now he said that agreat deal rests upon whether Bob in-,intended, believed, and desired, or desired...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...that the funds be used for a specificpurpose, when he sent 'em back over there.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) now how did Bob fit intothe conversation?APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.14EHRLICHMAN:Oh. they just thought that was silly. Iwent through this whole business of deep sixand the guy leaving the country and theKalmbach episode and all that, and they said, "Well, what do we get for the crimes?&#64258;So I said, "You just heard one." And I said,"Well, there's nothing there. It's ridiculous."PRESIDENT:They don't consider that as being part of aconspiracy downward (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:They do not. PRESIDENT:Why?EHRLICHMAN:They do not.PRESIDENT:'Cause you didn&#8482;t do anything. ERHLICHMAN:'Cause I didn't do anything. And they said,"Why, why was Kalmbach subservient to you?&#64258;and I explained that.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) and all fits together. ERHLICHMAN:And uh, they just didn't have any troublewith it. Now they may get a-earful overthere this afternoon. It's the prosecutors'job.PRESIDENT:Sure, they'll scare &#8218;em to death.EHRLICHMAN:And so they may have some (unintelligible)when they get back. I've suspected all along that we were being lulled as far as I'm concerned.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...and that Dean had unloaded a good dealmore than that. And so I'm going to beinterested to see uh, what they come backwith.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.15PRESIDENT:To the extent the prosecutors will tell them(unintelligible with noise) of the two, Deanand Magruder, uh, Magruder's(unintelligible). Dean says Magruder is a pathological liar.EHRLICHMAN:That's true, Magruder's been all over theplace in this case.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible with noise) Bob I would havethought it was a lie (unintelligible) hurtBob.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, it wasn't. I'm, I'm sure it was notintentionally because when I asked him ifanybody in the White House had beeninvolved...PRESIDENT:...and you talked to him after you'd alreadytalked to (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:That's correct. But he said he was tellingme everything that I had told you.PRESIDENT:What did he say? EHRLICHMAN:He said that he could not in any wayimplicate Bob, that Strachant yes, Dean,,yes, but, but, not Bob.PRESIDENT:Strachan, how? By, did he know about...EHRLICHMAN:You see Magruder's testimony is that he sentbudgets to Strachan that showed that the thing was going to be done. And then he sent...PRESIDENT:Strachan denied thatEHRLICHMAN:synopses and Strachan... PRESIDENT:...denies that.EHRLICHMAN:...denies the budget, admits the synopses.PRESIDENT:Right.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.16EHRLICHMAN:And uh, as a matter of fact, Magruderdoesn't even go so far as to say he sent thesynopses. He just says I told him that theywere available. He could come see. But uh, he steadfastly maintains through all ofthat, that he is, uh, that he has noevidence that Haldeman saw him and Strachan, now...PRESIDENT:We'll know a little more, I mean after we(unintelligible) to how much the(unintelligible) I mean that we're at a situation, we're at a situation where Ithink it's just going to be too difficult towield.EHRLICHMAN:Yes. PRESIDENT:Uh, don't, don't let me reach it. I mean Idon't, understand, I don't reach it until I,uh, I don't uh, I'm not going to reach it with anybody else.EHRLICHMAN:I've tried to, I&#8482;ve tried reasoning this outfrom the standpoint of your well being...PRESIDENT:Exactly. EHRLICHMAN:...and it seems to me I have to go back tomy Siamese twin analogy. You cut thoseSiamese.twins apart and somebody dies.PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:And, uh...PRESIDENT:Both die.EHRLICHMAN:Maybe. Uh, you are so terribly close in theperception of the press.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Perception of the... PRESIDENT:I agree with that. But, you also have thissituation involved in keeping all thisAPRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.17PRESIDENT:(unintelligible) In other words, I couldn't(CONT.)agree more. I believe in fighting like helland so forth. Trying to keep...EHRLICHMAN:Well, it isn't, it isn't really a questionof demonstrating loyalty or anything likethat.PRESIDENT:No, no, no, no, no, I believe in trying tokeep it if it can be done.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, well, I think we have to, we have toanalyze this, and I think if you kept it,you would have to go out and say, "I have carefully reviewed the evidence which theU.S. Attorney and the, and the AssistantAttorney General have brought me on the subject, uh, (tape noise) announced to so and so, uh (unintelligible with tape noise)weigh on the one hand this, the, thevalidity and seriousness of the charge versus the value of the (unintelligible) individual...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...and the integrity of the office. There'san overriding consideration uh, in, in,(unintelligible).&#64258; They do this either way,whether he stays or goes.PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:If you say "Weighing this I've uh come tothe conclusion that..."PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:It's not clear cut either way.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:"I must do so and so." PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:But, I think you have to make a, you have tomake a public explanation either way.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.18PRESIDENT:That's right. Yeah. Public explanation isbelieved. And uh, (tape noise) it might bethe other uh, yeah, yeah, but, if we make apublic explanation, we're (unintelligible) the facts. That's all there is to it.EHRLICHMAN:However, Weicker will.PRESIDENT:Huh. EHRLICHMAN:You know Weicker will. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Let me say that in that case, doingit that way, (tape noise) every intention, Imean I wish (unintelligible) do it that way, but doing it that way we uh, we'd uh, sayall of these things happened(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...or I could say I've asked for a(unintelligible) Haldeman go out and tellthem that.EHRLICHMAN:Either that or, or, we're going to have tohave a statement or synopsis or something.I don't know...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...how you do that.PRESIDENT:Here are the facts and, And, uh, people Iwill uh (tape noise).EHRLICHMAN:People may disagree with you. It's ajudgment call. But uh, this is the way Ihave to call it. (Unintelligible). Uh, ifyou don't do it that way, then all (unintelligible) ugly inferences arise. Uh,either way, if you keep him, ugly inferencesarise that you're covering up. Uh, if you let him go, then the inferences arise that you're disloyal or he's venal or(unintelligible) that sort of thing. Soyou've got to go to the (unintelligible).APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.19PRESIDENT:It seems to be true that both(unintelligible) and (unintelligible) yours(unintelligible) (tape noise)(unintelligible) get my...EHRLICHMAN:(tape noise) too early for you? You won't beback that early, will ya?PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) sharp. EHRLICHMAN:He's a very reliable--He's very sharp. PRESIDENT:You can't (unintelligible) the options on athing like resignations.EHRLICHMAN:Yes. Yes indeed, we sure have. And... PRESIDENT:Oh, good, good. Why (unintelligible) thispoint.EHRLICHMAN:They're very preliminary, but they both tryto look at it from your standpoint. That Bob leaving would hurt you more than help you.PRESIDENT:What's their reason?EHRLICHMAN:On the (unintelligible). In other wordsthat it would look like you were overreacting, number one. That, uh, uh, uh,that, that, that the facts known were notsufficient to justify it so there must be other facts hidden that you're notexpressing.PRESIDENT:Oh, I see. EHRLICHMAN:And that uh... PRESIDENT:In your case doubly so.EHRLICHMAN:uh, uh, that would be the (unintelligible)extension (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Alright, alright (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:That's a very tentative conclusion.PRESIDENT:That's before they go down (unintelligible).APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.20EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) so uh, you shouldn't rest(unintelligible) on that.PRESIDENT:The second point ist uh, well, I don't know.EHRLICHMAN:Well, (unintelligible) the second point is(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well, thank you very much. Alright, now let'scome down to the hard place. (Tape noise)that, what did they say? Anything about thereis an indict--a that your name is co--anunindicted co-conspirator.EHRLICHMAN:Well, of course, that's got them on their ear.They just don't even understand what that is.This, this is something that they can't understand. It's one of the reasons they wentdown there. Just to find out what that's allabout.PRESIDENT:Alright.EHRLICHMAN:Because they, they say that's just not properprocedure, and of course they're also just ontheir ear about the fact that the reporters'notes got out and they say that that isGlanzer. That's a typical prosecutor's trick to give Anderson those, those reporters' noteson Strachan's interrogation.PRESIDENT:I just, I. I told Petersen today, I said(unintelligible) came right out of the U.S.Attorney's office. Yeah, I said, "Don't giveme that stuff that the report, that, that youchanged the report (unintelligible)."EHRLICHMAN:Old, old Wilson said, "Listen, I've beenaround this town for, for thirty-five years,"and he said that, practicing law here, and hesaid, "That's the U.S. Attorney. That's theonly place that could ever (unintelligible)."PRESIDENT:It's a terrible thing to do to somebody. Whatdoes it do, John? (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:In a proceeding, of course what, what itreally does, it just, it just cuts the hell out of Haldeman. Because--It's a vicious cutand it's, it's Glanzer softening him upAPRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.21EHRLICHMAN:is what it amounts to. Because uh,(CONT.) well they're going to check. They don'tknow. They don't know.PRESIDENT:Be very hard to, very hard to prove thatthat's, uh, what uh--Well, the bad thingthat&#8482;s came out, of Parkinson and Bittman...EHRLICHMAN:Sure. PRESIDENT:Is, uh, (unintelligible) which the GrandJury (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:They said that uh, there's uh, there's uh,some story going on the wire about somebody taking eight boxes of political papers outof the White House the day after theburglary.PRESIDENT:Political papers. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, some, some lawyer is going down anduh, uh, (tape noise) court for an orderabsolving him and his client of contempt by reason of their taking eight boxes of materials out of the White House on the 18thof June and holding them until just beforethe election and then returning them to the Committee for the Re-election. And so theysecreted them during that period of time.PRESIDENT:Apparently EHRLICHMAN:(tape noise) No idea, no idea at all, uh... PRESIDENT:Did Colson tell them the truth?EHRLICHMAN:I assume so, but I haven't the foggiestnotion.PRESIDENT:No.EHRLICHMAN:Now, he's coming over to see me. He's overthere now.PRESIDENT:Who, Colson ? EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, and I'll find out (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:But the material is still...APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 5:15 TO 5:45 P.M.22EHRLICHMAN:In the custody of the Committee to ReElect.PRESIDENT:Uh, (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I don't know, I don't know even what thesignificance of it is. He said somebody had some guilty knowledge of the fact the truckcame here to (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:And the lawyer, the individual who did it? EHRLICHMAN:And his lawyer. PRESIDENT:...was charged with it?EHRLICHMAN:No, no, have petitioned the court forabsolution to keep his skirts clean by coming forward and making a clean breast ofthings, I guess. I uh, it's all very muddyand obscure to me, but, uh...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) up the river went(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Yup.PRESIDENT:You still think I should go to Florida? EHRLICHMAN:(Laughs) well, I don't think it's, I don'tthing it's much point in you sitting here.You can always come back, you know. Uh, yousit-here and these things just keep grinding away (unintelligible) something like thatevery twenty minutes. And uh...PRESIDENT:Sure.
