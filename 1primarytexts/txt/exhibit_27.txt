You knowwhat I mean. It's a curious thing, butthat's, but I'm afraid that's the way it operates. Uh, we, uh, you know, every daythere's, uh, there's, uh, some other damnlittle thing that somebody's talks around with, don't you see, so everything can be explained and try to defend and all thatsort of thing. But, uh, I'm not prepared tomake that judgement and, uh, I want you talk to John about it.HALDEMAN:Yeah. Okay.**********PRESIDENT:Get a line on what Petersen (Unintelligiblewith tape noise) Ehrlichman was informed byDean of a meeting that Dean had with Liddyon the 19th of June, well actually, this, that was when, that was done when he was in California in January but, irrelevant, itwas later anyway, that kind of thing, justkeep banging around, banging around, you know that prosecution gets out the damnstuff. Did, did John talk to you about it?HALDEMAN:Yeah, he mentioned it, and, uh,... PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Dean did tell us that story up inEhrlichman's office last week or two weeksago.PRESIDENT:But not to go through this?HALDEMAN:I don't think so.PRESIDENT:Yeah.

Another thing (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:And also (unintelligible) John Dean(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:John, and you get, uh, sit down and do some hardthinking about what kind of strategy you aregoing to have with the money. You know what I mean.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:That's got to be something perhaps better thansay, well, either one of the defendants can talk to the press and I don't; what in the hell thestrategy is I think you ought to talk aboutthat, but, uh, I'm a little concerned about the last bite or two, the one twenty-seven I don't know who, who talked about that one, but, uh, toHunt, Hunt's lawyer.HALDEMAN:Oh. PRESIDENT:Who's, who was the one that made that original--HALDEMAN:Dean. Bittman dealing directly to Dean on that.PRESIDENT:Right. Right. Then Dean came in and asked us,and what happened?HALDEMAN:We said we didn't know what to do about it, andwe said that's, you know, that's something that,that obviously Mitchell should be taking care of.PRESIDENT:Yeah.

HALDEMAN:...indicated in the meeting with us...PRESIDENT:YeahHALDEMAN:...the next day (unintelligible)APRIL 17, 1973 FROM 9:47 TO 9:59 A.M.5PRESIDENT:Unintelligible). On the other hand, that,of course, indicates knowledge and so forth.HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Uh, look, you've got to call Kalmbach so Iwant to be sure, I've been trying to try tofind out from Dean what the hell he is goingto say he told Kalmbach. What did Kalmbach say that Dean told him, they wanted money for this support purpose?HALDEMAN:I don't know, John is talking to Kalmbach.PRESIDENT:Well, be sure that Kalmbach is at leastaware of this. Uh, LaRue has talked veryfreely. He's a broken man. And, uh, theother thing is that this destruction of the evidence thing is troublesome, of course. John tells me, too, uh and basically theculprit is Pat Gray. Has Colson talked,know about that? That's why Colson calling, Colson, Colson was caught because Colson was in the room when it was handed to Gray.HALDEMAN:No, he wasn't. Well, apparently he wasn't.*********** PRESIDENT:He says he wasn't?HALDEMAN:Colson thought there was a meeting beforethat, where they talked about the deep- sixing and all that supposedly...PRESIDENT:He was in that meeting?HALDEMAN:which Colson was supposed to have been in.PRESIDENT:Right.
