TRANSCRIPT OF A RECORDING OF A MEETINGBETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND H.R. HALDEMAN,OVAL OFFICE, APRIL 20, 1973, FROM 11:07 TO11:23 A.M.TRANSCRIPT OF A RECORDING OF A MEETING BETWEEN THEPRESIDENT AND H.R. HALDEMAN, OVAL OFFICE, APRIL 20, 1973,FROM 11:07 TO 11:23 A.M.HALDEMAN:Yep. This is exactly the right thing to dothat, I think. I think you were right insaying something; I think he couldn't have hit you. I pretended I wasn't there.PRESIDENT:Yeah. I understood that.(Unintelligible, with noise)PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah. I had a talk with, uh, Bush.He wants to be just as helpful as he canbut, boy, he's a workhorse.HALDEMAN:Really? PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well you know (unintelligible) evilwandering, said uh, and you know and thensomething about Reitz. He says Reitz let him go because Magruder told Reitz that Magruder had talked about Reitz'sinvolvement in what was called the dirtytricks department, which I don't know apparently about what it is and I said, "What the hell is that?&#64258; And, uh,(unintelligible). He said, "Well, it wassomething about some demonstration in front of the White House here," or some damnthing. (Unintelligible) Charges areillegal.HALDEMAN:God sake. That was something they had aguy, let's see, come over and joint thedemonstration group over here to tell 'em-to listen to what they were doing and report back.PRESIDENT:Yeah. You're right. So I -so George sayshe's rewritten.HALDEMAN:At least that's what the story is. PRESIDENT:He's got a lawyer.APRIL 20, 1973, FROM 11:07 TO 11:23 A.M.2HALDEMAN:Reitz says?PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Good Lord.PRESIDENT:And, uh, he's got Jerry Leonard(unintelligible) involved 15 ot 16 in theWhite House.HALDEMAN:In the White House?PRESIDENT:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;HALDEMAN:In the dirty tricks thing?PRESIDENT:Everything.HALDEMAN:Reitz says that? PRESIDENT:This is something Newsweek would want tokeep track. He said, "How much would theyhave?"HALDEMAN:Oh. (unintelligible with noise) Well, ifyou take account the press, that would begood. (Unintelligible with noise) soundslike probably true.PRESIDENT:Anybody? HALDEMAN:That's what they say.(24 second pause)HALDEMAN:I would doubt that, say how you could.Well, unless they're stretching out, uh,people that haven't any real -any direct tiein. Um.(Unintelligible with noise)PRESIDENT:And uh, (unintelligible with noise) the, ofcourse, burgeoning kind of hard to figureout, isn't it Bob? Very hard...APRIL 20, 1973, FROM 11:07 TO 11:23 A.M.3HALDEMAN:Well, yeah, it's burgeoning, burgeoning inother directions.PRESIDENT:What the hell is there putting Magruder intothe -I know what's going on, that sort ofthing I can't figure out. Can you?HALDEMAN:Magruder's lashing out on the thing youknow. I think, I think the damned thing ishere...PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:So what he's -what's happening is that he'strying for a better deal than they're givinghim and they're trying to get more information out him. They've already givenhim a better deal. Looking at their past(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Magruder. HALDEMAN:What this is -Magruder is give them something that will nail that down and, uh,we'll knock off (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Magruder, Magruder's uh, coming close. Seehe told Reitz what he had done(unintelligible). Magruder basicallytelling everything.HALDEMAN:So, Reitz better be careful. Magruder'stold a lot of people what he's done that hehasn't done. And that's -this is a part of process where people are, are, uh, panicking because somebody said something that isn't,that hasn't happened. Now, Magruder. Youcannot -see this is the problem here, we, we tend to look at each individual shop ashaving some having validity under thecircumstances. That's the Washington Post story today or yesterday or the Magruder story that he told one person or that hetold another but they don't check. Sosomething is wrong with some of 'em. You can't take all of them because they don'tcome together. And maybe you can't take anyof 'em. The truth of the matter is you have to take some butthe quesion is which and who knows which.APRIL 20, 1973, FROM 11:07 TO 11:23 A.M.4PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:And that is still a real problem. Peoplelook at you and say, well, you know, comeclean and tell us what really happened. Who knows?PRESIDENT:I tried to explain to George that moment hesaid (unintelligible). I said, "But George, you know every campaign there's going to be activities of-demonstrations, counter-demonstrations and that sort of thing and Isuppose that Reitz is involved in that, but I don't know that -I said, "Was he involvedin Watergate?&#64258; and he said, "Well, I don'tthink so," uh, you know George is (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Well, I can imagine that they had the youthcrew working in all kinds of various, youknow, demonstrations, infiltrating other demonstrations, anti-demonstrations to find out what was going on.PRESIDENT:George called it the dirty tricks departmentthey were in.HALDEMAN:That would be.PRESIDENT:Really in the dirty tricks department...HALDEMAN:Ha. PRESIDENT:Magruder.APRIL 20, 1973, FROM 11:07 TO 11:23 A.M.5HALDEMAN:If they had 'em it wasn't very damn goodbecause that was one of our problems is youcould never get anything -any action intheir area.PRESIDENT:Magruder.(Pause)PRESIDENT:I said, "George," uh, I said, "Give me thetruth. Have I done the right thing here?" And he said, "Oh, yes. It's like everythingelse. It's right for 24 hours and they say.'Try to do something more."'HALDEMAN:Ha ha.PRESIDENT:Right?HALDEMAN:Well, yeah, but I guess you could, well, youknow, and that's that...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:No matter what bright thing you do.PRESIDENT:He's reflecting I think, Bob, the uh,concern of the people on the hill as you said. He goes up there.HALDEMAN:Of course, this is just what we said when wesay it could just be -if you could just release your people to speak at the Senate,that'll take care of it. So you releaseyour people to speak to the Senate and they say, "What else will you do?&#64258; Then you say you're busted the case and you shifted thepeople over and the truth is going to comeout. And, uh, now you have -first, you nail &#8218;em, it would appear public pressure,nailing the Attorney-General.PRESIDENT:That's right.APRIL 20, 1973, FROM 11:07 TO 11:23 A.M.6HALDEMAN:Campaign manager.(Pause)HALDEMAN:one of the problems this morning made thepoint that they're not gonna settle for scapegoats. You can't get away with tryingto blame this on Magruder and Dean, which Ithink is probably true. And then they said so you have to move it up to Haldeman and then totally ignore Mitchell. And, uh,because you have to move to someone who washigh enough to have had the responsibility, but the dilemma that you have, the Presidentanswers -If you move to Haldeman, thenthere's no way the President escapes responsibility.PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:The other point is that on the Watergate,you can't go to Helm. On the other thing you can only very remotely remove him.PRESIDENT:Structures?HALDEMAN:Yeah. And even there, making the worstpossible case of adding everything up and believing it, of all the worst things thatcould be said, you make a very remote caseof, of, uh, knowledge and of one overt act that, that uh was in itself indirect three times removed. And that, that's what wegotta work for the lawyers so that's a goodquestion in taking it at its very worst and saying that every adverse witness' testimonyis accepted and acceptable, and believed,where would we come out? And even there, they say you don't come out where it matters.PRESIDENT:Well, you know I think -how I feel the uh.APRIL 20, 1973, FROM 11:07 TO 11:23 A.M.7(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:If talk about Mitchell, you do come out.There's um...PRESIDENT:The Mitchell thing is going to be clear ashell. He's gonna be indicted. I don'tthink...HALDEMAN:See that's not really accepted yet. Thething we don't realize is that we read these stories knowing more than the people whoread them know. And the people now, Ithink...PRESIDENT:Think it's going to be Haldeman?HALDEMAN:No. I don't think they know. I don't -butI don't think they're -I don't think they believe what they're reading. And even the analysts I don't think believe what they'rereading. I -I think a lot of people justcan't accept the possibility in their own minds that John Mitchell was involved. I don't think they can accept the possibilityI was either. I think that they -that...PRESIDENT:They might. HALDEMAN:But then on the other side...PRESIDENT:The enemies?HALDEMAN:The enemies would like to. But then on theother side, they have to say somebody must have been. And we damn well better find outwho because it won't suffice that we knewthatPRESIDENT:Haldeman and Ehrlichman and Dean did it...APRIL 20, 1973, FROM 11:07 TO 11:23 A.M.8HALDEMAN:That some low level types did it.PRESIDENT:I mean, uh, Magruder.HALDEMAN:Magruder and Dean. Well, unless you couldmake a rock bottom case on that, but now I don't think you can. There are too manypeople that know that the truth is, isotherwise.PRESIDENT:Why'd the Grand Jury know? They're gettinginto strangest issues. The dirty tricksdepartment is more than I can figure out.HALDEMAN:Uh, I would guess that why they are is thatthey're -well, it's the same thing youtalked about when you talked with them onSunday (unintelligible) thing you concluded which is that they are scared to death to let the Ervin Committee uncover anythingthat they haven't already uncovered, becausethat will then move to legislative action or at least higher. Uh, "Why in the hell did you discover this?"PRESIDENT:I don't believe I'll ask Petersen -you gottareach your lawyers. I don't think I'm going to ask Petersen about what Hunt talked aboutand so forth. I'm afraid, afraid itwouldn't do any good.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:What do you agree?HALDEMAN:I think so. I don't think you ought to askanything on it. I, I -you get these day to-day developments. There's nothing youcan do about it. I think we've got to lookat it in a little bit broader picture. You can't help but get sticklered by each one of them, but then each one gets revised orchanged or overwritten by something else.APRIL 20, 1973, FROM 11:07 TO 11:23 A.M.9PRESIDENT:Yeah. The only problem is the Hunt thing.Go over again and these damn nationalsecurity taps.HALDEMAN:They (unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Huh?HALDEMAN:If they know.PRESIDENT:How can we avoid it, Bob? HALDEMAN:That -he can just avoid talking about it ifhe wants to. We don't know what -so farPRESIDENT:I told 'em not to question him about it thatI'm sure they're into it.HALDEMAN:Well, if they go into it -well, if they gointo it the Grand Jury, then it'll be out asa Grand Jury leak. That's why I, I can't understand the lawyers don't seem to get very excited about it. I guess so maybeit's not exciting. It seems to me that thatis more than the thing where you just sit and say, "Oh, it must have been the court reporters."PRESIDENT:Sure.HALDEMAN:And if it is the court reporters, they oughtto indict the court reporters right now.And there ought to be -it seems to be that'sas big scandal as the Watergate is, but nobody seems to think so.PRESIDENT:(Laughs) I guess they figure that when it'sthe truth getting out to the columnist thatare trying to do us in and so forth.APRIL 20, 1973, FROM 11:07 TO 11:23 A.M.10HALDEMAN:But what happens to the process of justice?What's the point of a Grand Jury when BillRogers (unintelligible) about the whole -youknow, that you're entitled to be indicted before you are charged. (Pause) Andordinary...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:People are... PRESIDENT:What the hell...HALDEMAN:...even more so.PRESIDENT:I want to say that, uh, we, uh...(Pause)PRESIDENT:...uh, we really uh get the chance over theweekend. Go over (unintelligible with noise) it seems to me (unintelligible with noise).HALDEMAN:It's a grateful point.PRESIDENT:Would you say is the P.R., of thePresidential posture of the goddamned thing, uh, we've already talked about that. (Pause)PRESIDENT:The Presidential posture. You think we'rein the right posture at the moment?HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Something now, their line, I suppose is theyhave to get something higher. We can't get a scapegoat, so it's gotta be Haldeman.HALDEMAN:No.APRIL 20, 1973, FROM 11:07 TO 11:23 A.M.11PRESIDENT:or, it's got to be Mitchell? What else?HALDEMAN:There's got to be someone. Obviously,they're gonna keep trying on all of this.It's a quicker target. Of course, that's what they make of it. Somebody has to makethe legal thing work and then the publicpoint.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:Somehow it's a question of really puttingthat out and, and seeing where it comes out.(Pause)PRESIDENT:Wonder when will Dean start crashingEhrlichman.HALDEMAN:I had a feeling that he did, but he didn'tname names. So that he, what he said was you know there's people higher up -peoplefrom lower down (unintelligible) and thenthe guy that put it out assumed it was Haldeman and said it. Because John -what Ron says -John was surprised, startled, andchagrined that the name was named because hesays he didn't name any -he didn't name my name. And I think he's playing both thatthe guy misunderstood him. He told him toget the story out, said it was higher ups involved in this. And that is his cover on it, which we expected it would be. He wasdoing what he was told. Now the question iswho, who will we say told him. And then can you get away with saying that we told him.I assume he'll say both of us did. He mayjust say I did. Got a tough one there 'cause he had much more communication with John than he did with me.APRIL 20, 1973, FROM 11:07 TO 11:23 A.M.12PRESIDENT:Correct.HALDEMAN:He had no communication with you so there'sno way he can hang you into it.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:Come after the part that you wereinvestigating. That's why I think you'reyou're covered. Even on the -well, the Hunt -but that's -you're covered under national security grounds on that.PRESIDENT:Well, I don't know. But the recollection-my recollection -in fact, I did make notes on that conversation -I don't think we'dwant to...HALDEMAN:Apparently, apparently I gave Dean 'em'cause I can't find any.PRESIDENT:May be just as well. But, the point was itwas also discussed in terms of blackmail&#8218;cause it was the same conversation.HALDEMAN:I think so. PRESIDENT:Well, I remember specifically my saying I'dlike you to (unintelligible) a milliondollars. (Unintelligible) He said a million dollars. I guess we can get that.HALDEMAN:Hal But then I said about that but then Isaid, "We've started down that track," and you agreed that, you know, you won't get anywhere. That doesn't accomplish anything.The fact that you said a million or tenmillion or, or...PRESIDENT:Right. And Dean agreed.(Pause)APRIL 20, 1973, FROM 11:07 TO 11:23 A.M.13HALDEMAN:The facts still remain...PRESIDENT:Dean (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:That's privileged conversation...PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:...you can't use. You can try him as a(unintelligible) and if then you -we wantsome other way.PRESIDENT:Well, there's no action taken as far aswe're concerned. That's the one thing.Right?HALDEMAN:None. PRESIDENT:I don't know, either. Did he call Mitchellthen or who did call him, John Ehrlichman?HALDEMAN:I don't know. I don't have any idea. Idon't know that anybody did. (Pause)PRESIDENT:You don't think John did?HALDEMAN:John Ehrlichman?.PRESIDENT:Mitchell (unintelligible). HALDEMAN:That was John Ehrlichman wasn't the leastbit concerned about it.PRESIDENT:About the leak?HALDEMAN:He said come and (unintelligible) it out. PRESIDENT:Is that right? About a leak.HALDEMAN:Almost complete (unintelligible).APRIL 20, 1973, FROM 11:07 TO 11:23 A.M.14PRESIDENT:That's fine. If we have a leak, just letthe Grand Jury.HALDEMAN:We just know they were leaking.(Pause)PRESIDENT:Well somebody -didn't see them and uh.HALDEMAN:See, what the public saying this morning.PRESIDENT:Well my view is, I'd like to perhaps have ashort talk after you've met (unintelligible) perhaps we could meet with you and Johncould come in and we'd have a little...HALDEMAN:Okay. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Maybe ten after.HALDEMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:Particularly if you could discuss thequestion how we view to the public. Have the public watch the thing and how we, howwe stand on the -what we know is thecrescendo that's going to be built up.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Perhaps on you -And, perhaps on John, too.In other words we got to really have a, a,we've got to have a not only a legal, but we&#8482;ve got to have a, a public stands fare.And I just don't think Ziegler could go outwithout an expression of confidence in you and John. That's what I'm concerned about.APRIL 20, 1973, FROM 11:07 TO 11:23 A.M.15HALDEMAN:I think he's got to.PRESIDENT:Huh.HALDEMAN:I think he's got to. I think he can expressconfid -Well, I want to talk to him. I don't think you should express confidence inanyone.PRESIDENT:We'll see you. Bye
