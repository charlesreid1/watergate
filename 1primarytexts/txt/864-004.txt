TRANSCRIPT OF A RECORDING OF A MEETINGBETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND JOHN DEAN ONFEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.TRANSCRIPT OF A RECORDTNG OF A MEETINGBETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND JOHN DEAN ONFEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.PRESIDENT:Good afternoon, John, how are you?DEAN:Pretty good.PRESIDENT:I, uh, discarded some (unintelligible) won'tinterrupt us (unintelligible) uh, uh, didyou get your talk with Kleindienst yet?DEAN:I just had a good talk with him. PRESIDENT:Yeah, fine. Have you got him, uh,positioned properly, the uh--DEAN:I think, I think he is.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) properly--ah, has he talkedyet to Baker?DEAN:No, he hasn't, he, uh, he called Sam Ervinand offered to come visit with both he and Baker. And, uh, that was done last week.PRESIDENT:Uh, huh.DEAN:But he thought that timing would be bad tocall Baker prior to the joint meeting. So he says after I have that joint meeting, I'll start working my relationship withBaker.PRESIDENT:Well, Baker left with me that he was goingto, going to set up a joint meeting well,anyway (unintelligible). I see. SoKleindienst has talked to, uh, uh, he has talked to Ervin and Ervin said-- (unintelligible).DEAN:Ervin has left it dangling and said, "I'llbe back in touch with you.&#64258; Uh, I think-, what, what disturbs Me a little bit aboutBaker was his move to put his own man in asminority counsel, so quickly, without any consultation as he had promised consultation. And I'm told this man may be adisaster himself, the miinority counsel.FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.2PRESIDENT:He is? What do you mean to, is he--?DEAN:Well he's a, well I can't knock age, he's30, he's 30 years of age, he doesn't know athing about Washington.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:So we'll have to--PRESIDENT:Baker, Baker says that he puts the blame onthe White House. He says, whatchamacallits his name, Korologos called him and suggestedsomebody else, that was a great mistake.Course I didn't know anything about that, apparently.DEAN:Well Baker apparently is quite open in hisfelicity I want to counsel with you all, and I don't want to move until I've told you what I'm going to do, and then he did justthe reverse. So it was curious: one, thathe wanted a meeting with you. Uh, secondly: that, uh, he suggested Kleindienst as a conduit...PRESIDENT:That's correct.DEAN:...and there is hope, I think that, uh, hemay try to keep an eye on this thing and notlet it get into a total circus up there.PRESIDENT:Who? Baker. DEAN:Baker, Baker might. PRESIDENT:Well that&#8482;s what he indicated, he indicatedbut of course, of course with the regard tohis, uh, situation, his position though, and with regard to Kleindienst's position, I,uh, I shook Kleindienst up a bit but(unintelligible) really is the, is the fellow who's going to get most out of this (unintelligible) is Mitchell. Said othersare gonna get hurt too, but Mitchell is, ah,the real problem is whether or not Mitchell will--uh, get him on perjury.FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.3DEAN:Hum.PRESIDENT:I said now look, ah, perjury's very damnhard thing to prove too, fortunately. But,uh, if you, uh (unintelligible) keep from poppin' off, I said, well, I, I, I talked(unintelligible) did ya ever talk toMitchell about this. Never has.DEAN:No. PRESIDENT:He says he has never talked to him. Did yougo into the Mexican part of it withKleindienst or did you get...DEAN:Well, I...PRESIDENT:...into any substance at all?DEAN:I've always, I've always braced Kleindienstin the past about, you know, the potential implications of what this wholeinvestigation the Bureau conducted, what theU.S. Attorney's Office was doingPRESIDENT:That's right. DEAN:...what the trial meant...PRESIDENT:That's right.DEAN:...I think this could come to haunt... PRESIDENT:That's right.DEAN:If it gets out of hand, I don't want to getinto a lot of specifics.PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:I, at this last meeting, I just sat with himand said Dick, I said, "I don't think Iought to brief you on everything I know. I don't think...PRESIDENT:That's right.DEAN:...that's the way to proceed. But if I seeyou going down the wrong track, I'm going to have to tell you why.''FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.4PRESIDENT:Um hum. Good, good. What did he say?DEAN:He said, "I agree, that's the way it, shouldstand."PRESIDENT:On the Executive Privilege one, I worked with,uh, talked to John Ehrlichman a little and decided that the last paragraph, which, uh,should modified so that it covers what I mighthave to say if I were asked at a press conference, he&#8482;ll indicate what it, but in, in a nut shell, uh, rather than simply, flatly say that I think that what we should say is uh, that uh, that uh, that the uh, that members of thePresident&#8482;s staff I will not appear before aformal session of the Commission, committees. However, under proper, appropriate circumstances that uh, informal discussions, or so forth can be conducted to obtain information and so forth and so on--appropriate, I want, I want to tell you what you're, what we&#8482;re up against, righthere&#8482;s, uh, Kleindienst, Kleindienst hasindicated to me, I don't know whether he did to you, that uh, he felt that the back-up position should be an executive session of the Committee. And I said, "Well, that's a hell of a difficult thing the, for the men.&#64258; I said, "I think thatthe position should be one of a, that ourposition should be one of a, a, a solution. That you can't written interrogatories (unintelligible) which is unlikely, of the two committee&#352;I, uh, the, the ranking committee members and the counsel, questioning any memberof the White House staff, you know, underproper, you know restrictions...DEAN:Um hum. PRESIDENT:...and so forth and so on. I put that to Bakeras well and, uh, (unintelligible) said Baker, Baker probably, uh, probably wants to get, thesame reason that Ervin does, because of thepublicity and so forth, wants to haul down the White House staff and...DEAN:Um. PRESIDENT:...put them in the glare of those lights. DEAN:True.FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.5PRESTDENT:Uh, that we cannot have. That we cannot have.On the other hand, we cannot have a stonewall,so that it appears that we're not lettingthem. And so I think we&#8482;ve got to be in aposition to, did ya discuss this withKleindienst, as to what the position would be on that point? That, I think, John, is theimportant thing that Kleindienst has gottastand God damn firm on..DEAN:I did, I talked to Dick about that. I saidthat, uh, "One, there's a statementforthcoming. I don't know the timing on it."PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:The Department will issue. I said that, it'sfortunate the context it's coming out in,because Clark Mollenhoff solicited thestatement in a press inquiry that's coming outin unrelated context and not related toWatergate per se.PRESIDENT:Right, right.DEAN:And so that'll be out soon and that willdefine what the outer perimeters are. It also gives--PRESIDENT:Have Kleindienst say that nobody from theWhite House staff will testify before acommittee.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Of course, that doesn't help much at all.DEAN:Well, under normal circumstances, if they're-- PRESIDENT:...if they were normal.DEAN:That's the, there's little, uh, slide inthere. And then what, in a practical matter Itold &#8482;em would probably happen, would be muchlike the Flanigan situation where there's anexchange and the, the issues become verynarrow as to the information that's sought.FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.6PRESIDENT:Well, you worked with, uh, if you'd talkedto John Ehrlichman, you worked at revisingthat last paragraph.DEAN:We've done that. PRESIDENT:Oh, you've already worked with him on that.DEAN:Um hum.PRESIDENT:And, uh, well, after I see his, uh, thisCardinal Midi (phonetic) take me about, I think five, we ought to get rid of him inabout, ah, fifteen or twenty minutes. Youmight bring it down and, uh, you've got it written already?DEAN:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:Then let me take a look at it again. DEAN:Uh huh. PRESIDENT:And we'll approve the statement, I don'twant to put it out right now because I, I,just depends (unintelligible) I decide to do on the, do on the, the press thing.DEAN:It'd probably be easier not to have thosequestions in your press conference per se.PRESIDENT:I, I, would prefer, that's what I want todo, is to have this statement come after thepress conference, to say, if they askanything about it, that "I've covered that in a statement that will be issued tomorrow on Executive Privilege. It's verycomplicated (unintelligible) that's what Ihad in mind. I&#8482;d rather not be questioned on the statement.DEAN:Mollenhoff himself will debate you rightthere on the subject.PRESIDENT:Right. So I'll say I'm covering DEAN:And I did talk to Mollenhoff yesterday at,uh, Rogers' request.FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.7PRESIDENT:...(unintelligible) want to look in the case.DEAN:Tell him I want to look in the case and I hadan extended discussion with him on theExecutive Priviledge question. Of course, hediffers somewhat from where we're coming out,but he agrees that certainly the President has the legal authority to do that and he agreesalso that it's, uh, it's--PRESIDENT:Well, in his case, I mean what was he, talkingabout?DEAN:Well, he says, he thinks that all White Housestaff should be ready to run up to the Hilland testify and he asked...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).DEAN:...as to what they're doing and it's a rareexception when the President invokes theprivilege. I said, &#64257;Clark, that&#8482;s got to bethe other way around. The staff can&#8482;t operateif they're going to be queried on every bit ofcommunication they had with the President."PRESIDENT:That's right.DEAN:Mansfield, himself, Mr. President, hasrecognized that communications between you andyour are protected. He said this in a policystatement before they issued this resolutionup there on, uh, having confirmableindividuals agree they'd testify before theyare confirmed.(Pause)PRESIDENT:Well...DEAN:I'm--PRESIDENT:...as for confirmable individuals areconcerned, they're all available for testimonythough.DEAN:That's right. It's no problem there.PRESIDENT:It's no problem there.DEAN:There's not a giveaway by any means on that.FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.8PRESIDENT:...They, of course, will, uh, they, they,they, I guess, we, we would not normallyclaim Executive Privilege for Cabinetofficers would we?DEAN:Uh, no sir. Only, only if in, say the rareinstances where we have already, wherethey&#8482;re going for information which should be protected. Investigative files, uh, classified material or say, aid programs orsomething, when we did it in the last--IRSfiles. Those are the instances in which we&#8482;ve done it.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:And they're quite, uh, traditional and, andshould be expected by the Congress when they go after information like that.PRESIDENT:I think, I think went over to Kleindienst, Isaid just to show you how the worm turns here, what we went through in the Hiss case. There we were, investigating, not, uh,espionage by a political, what one politicalorganization against another, but a charge of espionage against the United States ofAmerica, which was a hell of a lot moreserious. And in that case, the Department of Justice, the White House, the FBI totally stonewalled the committee. The FBI wouldnot furnish any information and here the FBIhad a chance to furnish information to this committee.DEAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:That's according to Gray, right? DEAN:Right. PRESIDENT:All right. The Department of Justicerefused to give us any information at alland, of course the White House used Executive Privilege and the press was all ontheir side. You see that was...DEAN:That's right.FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.9PRESIDENT:...that was a, that&#8482;s, sure it's whose ox isbeing gored. Now here you got so-calledespionage involving a political organizationand, uh, so now (unintelligible).DEAN:Well, you know I've been...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).DEAN:...and in, in, uh, doing some checking. PRESIDENT:I told Dick a (unintelligible). That's whatour Democratic friends did when we weretrying to get information.DEAN:Lyndon Johnson, uh, was probably the, uh,greatest abuser of the FBI, I'm told bypeople, some of the old hands over there.PRESIDENT:He used it for everything. DEAN:He used it as his personal, uh-- PRESIDENT:But didn't he use it against the press?DEAN:He...PRESIDENT:That's ah&#352; DEAN:...used it against the press, he used itagainst his own party, uh, back in &#8218;64 whenthe Walter Jenkins thing broke, uh, he hadhigh officials of the FBI out trying, to strong-arm a doctor to say that this man hada brain tumor, uh, Walter Jenkins, he also,then, turned his, the FBI loose on the Goldwater staff, uh, this sort of thing is starting to seep...PRESIDENT:Uh, who knows?DEAN:...out now. PRESIDENT:Is it getting out?DEAN:Uh, I'm sorry. (Unintelligible).FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.10PRESIDENT:But you, of course, know the incident of his,uh, (unintelligible) the, the famous incidentof the bugging of our plane...DEAN:That&#8482;s right.PRESTDENT:which, uh, maybe--they really know is true.And you know, the instances that they talk about, about the, uh, about our bugging, theFBI stuff, believe me, I know exactly whatthose were.(Sensitive Material Deleted)DEANUm hum. Now they&#8482;re so--PRESIDENT:And then, of course, the other things involvedleaks out of the NSC, where we, they bugged Haig, Lake, or Halperin, I mean. But that wasall.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:We were as limited as hell, I mean Hoover,good God, we could have used him forever.He's, he's-- but Johnson had just apparently,just used them all the time for this sort ofthing.DEAN:That's what I'm learning. There's more andmore of this--PRESIDENT:Who&#8482;s, who&#8482;s who from the FBI is trying to putout this stuff on us?DEAN:God, I thought, I wish I knew, Mr. President,uh.PRESIDENT:You don't believe it's a--DEAN:I've heard there're, there're several namesthat are bantered around. I, I tried forexample, to track the leak.PRESIDENT:You don&#8482;t think it&#8482;s Sullivan?DEAN:N, no, I., I confronted Sullivan, as a matterof fact, right after this, I said, "Bill," Isaid, uh, I called him into my office, I said,&#64257;I want to tell you what Time Magazine saidthey have.&#64258; His reaction was not that of aman who has leaked something. Uh--FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.11PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:And then he helped.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).DEAHe told me, he said, "If this ever comes,down to the very short strokes," he said,"As far as I'm concerned this was Hoover andSullivan. No one else. And I'm ready to stand forward and take it at that.&#64258; I said, "Well, I don't think it's ever going to bethat because, uh--PRESIDENT:Well, what, why would it be Hoover andSullivan, did Hoover order him to do it?DEAN:Hoover ordered him to do it.PRESIDENT:In order to ah-- DEAN:They did this--so he could say I could citeexamples chapter and verse of Hoover tellingme to do things like this.PRESIDENT:Now Sullivan knows that their, it wasterribly limited--it was limited.DEAN:That's right.(Sensitive Material Deleted)DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:And that I must say, I think we did requestthough, did we say find out the leaks, andso Hoover goes and, uh, bugs people.DEAN:Well, I, I think PRESIDENT:That's the way to do it.DEAN:...the way it's postured now, uh, we canstonewall it, ah, Gray can go up there in his confirmation hearings and he's not gonnahave to bother with it, because they'daccused him in the article of being, sitting on top of the bugs...PRESIDENT:Yeah.FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.12DEAN:...it was there once he came in, which isnot factual.PRESIDENT:Well, there weren't any.DEAN:There were none there when he came in. PRIESIDENT:Well, three years ago that this happened...DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:...and there hasn't been a God damned thingsince.DEAN:That's correct.PRESIDENT:Right.DEAN:That's correct. PRESIDENT:Another thing you can say, too, John, is thefact that all this had to do with the war...DEAN:I know. PRESIDENT:...and now the war is over. DEAN:Now--PRESIDENT:Now Johnson, on the other hand, went bugginghis political opponents, and every son &#338;of- a- everything you can imagine. We've been, that&#8482;s the problem, getting a real bum rap,aren't we?DEAN:We cert--, we are getting a terrible rap,ah--PRESIDENT:You stop to think of, we got rid, we got ridof the Army bugs, we got, you know, that Army ah, espionage business, intelligence business, we got, you remember that?DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Uh, we've limited the FBI things to nationalsecurity bugs, to very, very certain few,probably too few.DEAN:We're, we're now (unintelligible).FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.13PRESIDENT:But somebody's gonna 7et a shock one day,and they'll wonder why we didn't bug 'em,huh?DEAN:That's right. We are getting a bad rap. PRESIDENT:Well, for example...DEAN:The fact is--PRESIDENT:...as you know, as you know, Hoover did bugMartin, Martin Luther King.DEAN:That's right, I was aware of that also.PRESIDENT:Well, Christ yes, Hoover used to tell usabout what his, what a, a morally depraved son-of-a-bitch he was--and Johnson probablyordered him to do it, now let&#8482;s face it.DEAN:Um hum. PRESIDENT:So, ah, I don't, well you can't blameHoover. I&#8482;m sure he didn't do it unless,ah, Johnson asked to, but Johnson was thatkind of a man, he used the FBI as his own private patrol, but God, we&#8482;ve been as careful, I've, I've talked to Hoover anynumber of times, but we&#8482;ve never orderedanything like that. But he'll come in with his little things.(Sensitive Material Deleted)DEAN:Johnson, ah... PRESIDENT:Huh? DEAN:...Johnson, used the FBI to cover the, ah,New Jersey convention before he dropped out,officially, he had all the delegates--PRESIDENT:He did?DEAN:That's right, which is kind of fantastic.PRESIDENT:Sullivan knows this?FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.14DEAN:Um hum, Sullivan is a wealth-of-knowledgeand the more I, you know, sort of generallychat with him about these problems, the moreit comes out he'sthe man that can also document--PRESIDENT:Why did Hoover have a fight with him? It'sa hell of a mistake for Hoover to do that. Sullivan knows too much.DEAN:That's right, ah.PRESIDENT:Why didn&#8482;t Sullivan squawk?DEAN:I think Sullivan probably is loyal to the... PRESIDENT:...institution&#352;DEAN:...the institution and doesn't want--PRESIDENT:Somebody over there is not, can he help youfind out who the hell is not? Isn't it a possibility...DEAN:He advised--PRESIDENT:...the guy that--Time Magazine's lawyer, youdon't think it's him?DEAN:He speculates, and, the speculation isgenerally, is it's either Sullivan himself,Mark Felt, who is--PRESIDENT:I know, the lawyer says that.DEAN:That's right. Ah, and the other one is afellow Tom Bishop who is now departed, who was in charge of their public information and where--PRESIDENT:Does he know about these things, Hooverdidn't tell people like that, about these things...DEAN:No.PRESIDENT:...did he? DEAN:For example, the '68 thing, I try-, wastrying to determine who might know aboutthat.PRESIDENT:Yeah, ah...FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.15DEAN:Hoover, apparently...PRESIDENT:Ah, I guess.DEAN:...Hoover apparently told Pat Coyne, PatrickCoyne, who used to be on the NSC staff.PRESIDENT:I know, I know, I believe, is he stillliving?DEAN:I don't, I don't know the man. PRESIDENT:He told Pat Coyne? DEAN:He told Pat Coyne; Coyne told Rockefeller;Rockefeller relayed this to Kissinger, thiswas one channel that might have it in a public domain. The other is when Sullivantook the records, or all the documents inconnection with this, ah, out of his office, and out of the Bureau, he also instructed the Washington Field Office to destroy alltheir records, which they did. Ah, Hoover,incensed at this, that he couldn't reconstruct, that he didn&#8482;t have the records and couldn't get them from Sullivan, triedto have the Washington Field Officereconstruct them, which they couldn't. As a result of that movement and flailing aroundby Hoover, a lot of people in the agencywere aware of what had happened and it was on the grapevine.PRESIDENT:Oh, that's when it happened then, the nightSullivan left, he took the records with him-DEAN:He took the records with him PRESIDENT:And that's the only records there were?DEAN:...and that's the only records there are.PRESIDENT:He did it out of, uh, I mean, pissed off atHoover.DEAN:No, ah, he was doing it to...PRESIDENT:Protect...DEAN:...protect, ah--FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.16PRESIDENT:...the Bureau.DEAN:No, he was doing it to protect the WhiteHouse and the people over here.PRESIDENT:Oh, oh, but for Christ sakes, Hoover, Imean, (unintelligible).DEAN:Hoover never got his hands on the records iswhat happened. Sullivan has them, Sullivan had his, ah, his pissing match with Hoover and then took them with him at that time.PRESIDENT:I see.DEAN:And then he turned them over to Mardianultimately.PRESIDENT:I see.DEAN:And-- PRESIDENT:That's how we got them. DEAN:And then--PRESIDENT:Where's Sullivan now?DEAN:Sullivan is back at Justice in the DrugIntelligence (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:We owe him something.DEAN:We do. He wants to go back to the Bureauand work on, ah, domestic, ah--PRESIDENT:Why is it that Gray doesn't want him?DEAN:I think Mark Felt has poisoned Gray on thisissue and I think once Gray--PRESIDENT:Well, who in the hell, somebody is doingMark Felt in. You know what, do you, do youbelieve the Time Magazine lawyer? Is Felt(unintelligible), is he capable of this sort of thing?FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.17DEAN:Well, let me tell you where I, where elseheard that from, ah, was Sandy Smith, ah, I had told, not, not the lawyer but somebodyelse told Felt was his source...PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:...and this came to Henry Petersen,Petersen's an old hand over there, as you know, and, ah, bless his, soul, he's a valuable man to us. Ah--PRESIDENT:Yeah. What did he say?DEAN:Ah, he said that he wouldn't put it pastFelt but, ah, the other thing I was talkingto Kleindienst about this when I was overthere, he said if Felt is the source...PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:...and if we gets Felt way out of joint weare in serious trouble.PRESIDENT:'Cause he knows so much? DEAN:He knows so much. PRESIDENT:What's he know?DEAN:I don't know, I didn't ask for specificswith, ah, he said, one thing, he said he could knock.PRESIDENT:Does he know about Sullivan stuff?DEAN:Yes, he knows about that. I called Felt,asked him what he knew about it and he was, for example, very cool when I, I said&#64257;There&#8482;s a Time Magazine story running,Mark, ah, that in &#8482;68...PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:or, or '69 and '70...PRESIDENT:Yes.FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.18DEAN:and so on and so forth. He said, I "True orfalse?&#64258; and, he said, "True&#64258; I said, "How doyou know that?" and I said, "I&#8482;ve never heardof that before." He said, "Well, if you talkto Bill Sullivan, he'll tell you all aboutit.&#64258; When he did he, sort of a general, he painted a general picture about it. Ah, justcool as a cucumber about it. Ah--PRESIDENT:And what does he say about Time, again, howdoes he, is he gonna stand up for the denial?DEAN:He says, "John, " he said, ah, I said &#64257;Firstof all, I don&#8482;t, I don't believe this couldhappen," I was protecting us, as far as...PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:...doubting w7hat he had said. He said, &#64257;WellJohn, as far as I'm concerned, our, our phonecall is totally off the record, we never hadit,&#64258; so that's a good one to watch, just rightthere.PRESIDENT:In other words, you can't blow the whistle onFelt, just like you can't blow the whistle onthe son-of-a-bitch out there, the yeoman, inthe Jack Anderson case, right?DEAN:That's right, but there will become, ah, therewill come a day when Gray's comfortably inthere, when other things come past, that ah--PRESIDENT:Like what?DEAN:I think that Gray called at some point when, if this sort of thing continues, once he gets through his confirmation, I don't know why hecouldn't himself say "I&#8482;m gonna take a liedetector test and I'm gonna ask everybody inmy immediate shop to take one and then we&#8482;regonna go out and ask some of the other agentsto take them...PRESIDENT:Just for leakage.DEAN:&#64257;...as for leakage, because this, this onlyhurts, ah, this whole institution."(Pause)FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.19PRESIDENT:Where do you, ah, where do you stand on the,how will we leave it on Kleindienst hearswith regard to the, that's what there, ah,let me put it this way. You take the responsibility for Kleindienst, I'm gonnakeep Ehrlichman and Haldeman out of it--outof their any relationship with Kleindienst. You should have it only, but you've got to watch him and brace him--, on the ExecutivePrivilege thing, that you, that you tell himwhat the line is...DEAN:I have, I have...PRESIDENT:...and where he's to stand.DEAN:I have told him and I've s-, I said "It'sgonna be important."PRESIDENT:Didn't he raise the idea of their hurryingthe Executive Session refusal?DEAN:No, he did not. PRESIDENT:All right. Be sure he knows what the, backup position is, which is (unintelligible),as I understand it, if we went in thereunder proper ah, ah, restrictions, allow, uh, two committee members to come down. Isthat what you would do?DEAN:I think we wo-, ought, if I think we oughtto draw the line at written interrogatories. I think the position should be that you wereholding nothing back, information wise.PRESIDENT:That would be sworn. DEAN:That's right, that would be sworn, uh, youcan't be in a position of protecting any,anybody around here.PRESIDENT:That's right. DEAN:The information has to be available. But togo up there and make a circus out of theappearance of, of people--PRESIDENT:Right.FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.20DEAN:Ah--PRESIDENT:Good, well let me say about ah, about Felt,it sounds as if he knows, it sounds as ifmaybe he's--DEAN:Kind of watch it like a hawk, Mr.President...PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:...and I just got to watch him, ah, he's tooclose to Pat Gray right now...PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:...for our interests. PRESIDENT:Pat Gray is a little naive. (SensitiveMaterial Deleted)DEAN:Yeah. Well I think it's-- PRESIDENT:And he never ever has anything wrong, findout some interesting facts, but, ah, nothingever used. I mean we just were awfulcareful. Joe Kraft, of course, should have been bugged. I would think the son-of-a-bitch is, ah, practically an agentto the communists.DEAN:Well, what you said about Bob and John too,I think, as before the election, I tried toonly bother them or consume any of theirtime when it was just absolutely essential.PRESIDENT:Right. DEAN:And I think that's the way it's been.PRESIDENT:That's right, that's right.DEAN:He, ah Unidentified:(Unintelligible) is here.PRESIDENT:Fine, fine.HALDEMAN:Did he buzz?FEBRUARY 27, 1973, FROM 3:55 TO 4:20 P.M.21PRESIDENT:I buzzed twice, that means they, for &#8218;em tocome in. (Unintelligible) buzz(unintelligible) that means.HALDEMAN:Apparently the phones aren't workingproperly.PRESIDENT:Oh fine, sure, sure, sure, have 'em comeright in. Right there(Unintelligible with noise)DEAN:Well, sir, I'll get that statement onexecutive privilege.PRESIDENT:If you could, uh, if you could, uh, do yourbest to, uh, if you could keep me posted on(unintelligible) everything that way youneed to but particularly with relation to Kleindienst. Okay?
