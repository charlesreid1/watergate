I, uh, sit down, that's allright, fine, I was thinking that, uh, that(unintelligible) we possibly ought to use John Connally in the meantime, maybe (unintelligible) more to try to hammer out,uh, what our, what our strategy is here onWatergate. Rose, I'm sorry, I didn&#8482;t intend, I didn't intend, just wait for theItalian. I'll call you later.WOODS:Okay.

Let's see, I couldmeet, uh, no, uh, after that, 12:30, uh, I o'clock.HALDEMAN:The reason being, uh and the only reason, uhthat there is felt to be, and we may not want to react to it) but we may, there'sfelt to be, Colson, for instance, calledEhrlichman this morning and said that, uh, his sources you know, around town and everything, uh, say that we've got one moreday to act on our, our initiative.(Privileged Material Deleted).APRIL 17, 1973 FROM 9:47 TO 9:59 A.M.2HALDEMAN:Uh, that, uh, this, all these breaks, thisbreaking-in stuff'sPRESIDENT:All over town.HALDEMAN:and, uh, uh PRESIDENT:So we may have to go today?HALDEMAN:that you have also have, have, you saw theL.A. Tines has a storyPRESIDENT:About? HALDEMAN:the White House has got toPRESIDENT:Yes. Yeah.HALDEMAN:move, and the thought came that if we'regoing to move today, we probably ought tomeet earlier, so that we're ready to move by3:00PRESIDENT:Fine. HALDEMAN:3:30 or something.PRESIDENT:Okay. If you get, uh, get together. Ithink we have to move today.HALDEMAN:Well, if we look like we, we ought to moveon something, if we've got anythingPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...just to get out front in some way. PRESIDENT:Well, you might have to, might have to givethem a full report today, the way it'sbreaking so fast. Let me say that the problem you've got here is that, I had a long talk with Rogers, and so forth, ofcourse he was much more rational than Lenis. Len's supposedly quite a pro, but, on the other hand, uh, 1, you've got theproblem of being, you and John being sort ofnibbled to death over a period of time,HALDEMAN:Yep.APRIL 17, 1973 FROM 9:47 TO 9:59 A.M.3PRESIDENT:an, uh, by not moving, having a situationwhere, frankly, your, your chances of yourbeing, I mean of your, uh, being publiclyattacked, and also even the, even the steam of the prosecution is greater. You knowwhat I mean. It's a curious thing, butthat's, but I'm afraid that's the way it operates. Uh, we, uh, you know, every day there's, uh, there's, uh, some other damnlittle thing that somebody's talks aroundwith, don't you see, so everything can be explained and try to defend and all thatsort of thing. But, uh, I'm not prepared tomake that judgment and, uh, I want you talk to John about it.HALDEMAN:Yeah. Okay.PRESIDENT:Get a line on what the prosecutors, Petersen(unintelligible with tape noise), Petersen (unintelligible) Ehrlichman was informed by Dean of a meeting that Dean had with Liddyon the 19th of June, well actually, thiswas, that was done when he was in California in January but, irrelevant, it was lateranyway, that kind of thing, just keepbanging around, banging around, you know that prosecution gets out the damn stuff. Did, did John talk with you about it?HALDEMAN:Yeah, he mentioned it, and, uh,PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Dean did tell us that story up inEhrlichman's office last week or two weeksago.PRESIDENT:But not to go through this? HALDEMAN:I don't think so.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:I think I mentioned it to you, remember. Idescribed the story to you in some detailwhen lie walked down 17th Street--APRIL 17, 1973 FROM 9:47 TO 9:59 A.M.4PRESIDENT:No. This was all after we had started our owninvestigation.HALDEMAN:Oh, yeah.PRESIDENT:I mean, it wasn't back then. It wouldn'tindicate that we knew about all this, and soforth. Another thing. (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:And also (unintelligible) John Dean(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:John, and you get, uh, sit down and do somehard thinking about what kind of strategy youare going to have with the money. You knowwhat I mean.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:That's got to be something perhaps better thansay, well, either one of the defendants cantalk to the press and I don't, what in thehell the strategy is I think you ought to talkabout that, but, uh, I'm a little concernedabout the last bite or two, the onetwenty-seven don't know who, who talked aboutthat one, but, uh, to Hunt, Hunt's lawyer.HALDEMAN:Oh. PRESIDENT:Who's, who was the one that made thatoriginal--HALDEMAN:Dean. Bittman dealing directly to Dean onthat.PRESIDENT:Right. Right. Then Dean came in and askedus, and what happened?HALDEMAN:We said we didn't know what to do about it,and we said that's, you know, that's somethingthat, that obviously Mitchell should be takingcare of.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well, in any case, taking care of.HALDEMAN:And, and then they,PRESIDENT:But...HALDEMAN:... indicated in the meeting with usPRESIDENT:YeahHALDEMAN:...the next day (unintelligible)APRIL 17, 1973 FROM 9:47 TO 9:59 A.M.5PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). On the other hand, that,of course, indicates knowledge and so forth.HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Uh, look, you've got to call Kalmbach so Iwant to be sure. I've been trying to try tofind out from Dean what the hell lie isgoing to say lie told Kalmbach. What did Kalmbach say that Dean told him, they wanted money for this support purpose?HALDEMAN:I don't know, John is talking to Kalmbach.PRESIDENT:Well, be sure that Kalmbach is at leastaware of this. Uh. LaRue has talked veryfreely. He's a broken man. And, uh, theother thing is that this destruction of the evidence thing is troublesome, of course. John tells me, too, uh and basically theculprit is Pat Gray. Has Colson talked,know about that? That's why Colson calling, Colson, Colson was caught because Colson was in the room when it was handed to Gray.HALDEMAN:No, lie wasn't. Well, apparently liewasn't.PRESIDENT:He says he wasn't?HALDEMAN:Colson thought there was a meeting beforethat, where they talked about the deep-sixing and all that supposedlyPRESIDENT:He was in that meeting?HALDEMAN:which Colson was supposed to have been in.PRESIDENT:Right. Right. Right. HALDEMAN:Colson doesn't remember being in it, butColson flatly says that he had, that he,there was never anything where he was where there was a discussion...PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 17, 1973 FROM 9:47 TO 9:59 A.M.6HALDEMAN:...of Hunt getting out of the country.PRESIDENT:Alright.HALDEMAN:Kehrli says the same thing. He was alsosupposed to be at that same meeting. In fact,Ehrlichman has checked everybody who was atthat meeting and nobody recalls that being said except Dean. And we now have the pointthat Dean is the one who called Liddy and toldhim to telephone uh, Hunt to get out of thecountry and then called him later and said notto. (Pause).PRESIDENT:Get this, get, I'd like a policy, I thinkyou've got to get a policy story on Monday. I think, Bob, though, we have to think, I mustsay that I haven&#8482;t, that, that we&#8482;ve got tothink about a positive move, uh, and I thinkit's got to be today.HALDEMAN:I agree.PRESIDENT:I think it should be at 3:00 today. Uh, theimportant thing, which I don't know, is, uh, Ihope the story doesn't break today, but, uh--HALDEMAN:Even if it does, you can get into cycle withit.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well, I don't want to be answering it.HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:RESTRICTED-&#64257;B&#64258;I want a, I want a thing done today and uh,you and John have got to think, frankly, interms, let me say, not don't just think in terms as a national good for the, well, thePresident and all that crap(unintelligible/REMOVED), but also you got tothink in terms of having this God damn thingcontinue to be dragged out bit by bit onanswers that are dragged out bit by bit,anyway, I suppose. But, uh, the point isthat, uh, Dean's incentive with the U.S.Attorney, incentive with everybody else will be this and that. You get my point?APRIL 17, 1973 FROM 9:47 TO 9:59 A.M.7HALDEMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:I'm sure you and John have talked about it.(15 Second Pause). You see, what's happenedhere, the prosecution has been pretty clever. They got Magruder, well, Magruderjust, just caved, but it had to come, it hadto come, Bob. There was no way it wasn't going to come.HALDEMAN:Right. There have been some(unintelligible). I think, I think it had toand should.PRESIDENT:That's right. The other point is, the otherelement of this question how is Hunt, and asfar as Dean is concerned, he's basically the one that surprises me and disappoints me to an extent, because he really is trying tosave his neck and doing so easy. He's not,to hear him tell it when I talked to him, he's not telling things that are, you know (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:That's not really true though. He is.PRESIDENT:I know, I know, I know. He tells me onething and tells the others other things.That's when I get mad. But, Dean is, Deanis trying to tell them enough to get immunity, that's frankly what it is Bob.HALDEMAN:That's the real problem we've got. It hadto break and it should break,PRESIDENT:That's a hell of a problem to break. HALDEMAN:but what you've got is people within it, asyou said right at the beginningPRESIDENT:Thanks a lot. HALDEMAN:with Petersen, they've got an incentive toexaggerate. So, they've been told the morethey give them the better they'll come out.PRESIDENT:Yeah, well, I got to go. I'll, I'll beready by 1:00.HALDEMAN:Okay.
