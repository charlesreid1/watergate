EHRLICHMAN:We just had a counsel cogitator and they'regetting down to the, down to the head hunt,the heavy golfing now....PRESIDENT:Christ, I hope not. EHRLICHMAN:...and, uh, they feel strongly that weshould voluntarily go down for informalconferences if the U.S. Attorney wants us, and so we, we Ill be doing that, I guess.PRESIDENT:Whatever you -but you make the moveyourself?EHRLICHMAN:They may have left an arrangement with theU.S. Attorney that when, as, and if he wantsus, he will phone then, and we will just godown on our own motive.PRESIDENT:Or you would not. HALDEMAN:And, uh, we will probablyPRESIDENT:But, you will not try to accelerate that?EHRLICHMAN:Well, we're gonna try, we, we're gonna tryand get ready first.HALDEMAN:He, yeah, but he said could not acceleratethat...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Yeah. That was his first (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:And fine...APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 12:16 TO 12:34 P.M.2HALDEMAN:Now, we probably do it in a neutral place...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...rather than at their office.PRESIDENT:Right, right. Uh, oh, good, uh, wait aminute, Bush, of course, is letting Reitzgo. And I said to him, uh, that&#8482;s a stupidthing to do. I said well we (unintelligible) Of course, Bush, I suppose, is the school of people who let everybodygo.EHRLICHMAN:Mr. Clean. PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Of course, Reitz isn't his guy. JesusChrist.PRESIDENT:I don't (unintelligible) He said Reitz isinvolved with money too somewhere.HALDEMAN:Oh, really.PRESIDENT:No, no, no, God damn it. God damn it. WhatI meant is in the handling of the, the money to these people apparently, or somethinglike that. Do you know anything about theReitz...EHRLICHMAN:I know, I know a little bit about it, andthat's the Muskie chauffeur.HALDEMAN:Reitz was in that? EHRLICHMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 12:16 TO 12:34 P.M.3PRESIDENT:Well, nothing wrong with that.EHRLICHMAN:And, he did -Muskie's chauffeur worked forno money. He worked on the loyalty, but,uh, uh, they did give him some expenses for some things that had to be done and Iguess...HALDEMAN:What the world is wrong with that? EHRLICHMAN:I don't know, this, this seems to me to beover-reacting.HALDEMAN:If Manolo went over to the DemocraticNational Committee and said Id like to tell you what the President&#8482;s up to and they saidfine, tell us, what's wrong with that? Fromtheir viewpoint it's wrong to know...PRESIDENT:Somebody comes in and volunteers, they'regonna take it. If they volunteered JackAnderson--gonna criticize (unintelligible)they volunteered anybody else. There it is, that's the real one.HALDEMAN:Reitz.PRESIDENT:I asked them about it. I talked to Petersenabout the idea of John's speeding up the Grand Jury. He says, Christ, there'snothing we'd like to do better, but he sayswe've got a hell of a problem because each person talks about somebody else, and they give it to somebody else then, and we got toread the record, and I says well,(unintelligible) the longer this thing goes on, the more leaks out, the more innocentpeople will be indebted, and so forth and soon.HALDEMAN:Yeah.APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 12:16 TO 12:34 P.M.4PRESIDENT:But, I don't know, I don't know if that'sgood or not. Yeah, I think it's thevictims...EHRLICHMAN:Well I understand, but I think it would bejust a matter of letting him know that youwere in a hurry, and then periodicallykeeping the heat on him.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:So that he doesn't--the thing to fear hereis that Silbert will deliberately try tostretch this thing out, hoping for some kind of a, an apple to fall off the tree.HALDEMAN:They're convinced that's what he's doing.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:So is Colson.PRESIDENT:Yep. Is Colson involved in the Reitz thing,is that what this is?EHRLICHMAN:No. Not to my knowledge. That was aMagruder operation.PRESIDENT:Well, Magruder was the one that's talkedabout it.HALDEMAN:Yeah--that's a separate from, uhPRESIDENT:They, uh, they, uh, they, uh, they, they saythey have Magruder and he's talking and so forth, and someone's cooperated but they haven't--they said we still only have anarm's length arrangement with Dean, and thearrangement, so I...EHRLICHMAN:Dean's just changed the terms.APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 12:16 TO 12:34 P.M.5PRESIDENT:Changed the terms?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:Why, I wonder?EHRLICHMAN:Uh, probably because these guys didn'tdeliver what they said they would. He's gota guy who's Humphrey's field director in'68.PRESIDENT:Jesus Christ. HALDEMAN:Well, (unintelligible) who that would be-hisformer co-brother-in-law...EHRLICHMAN:Who is married to the sister... HALDEMAN:He's cousins of the sister of Dean's firstwife.PRESIDENT:Well, I just hope the poor son-of-a-bitch isnot gonna turn him completely rat but that's, uh, what, what Dean is gonna try tonegotiate now I don't know. But, Christ, Ithink he must have--It seems to me he&#8482;s told them whatever he can so far. Don't you think Dean has?EHRLICHMAN:It'll sound like it to me if he is into thatHunt business. That's pretty far.PRESIDENT:Where the hell he get that? Where else couldhe have gotten that stuff?EHRLICHMAN:We know that's where it came from I think.Uh, uh, something on that point. Mr. Wilson's just now talking about whetherDean's situation here was difficult or not,and it's his judgment that we are not to disserve him at this point.APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 12:16 TO 12:34 P.M.6PRESIDENT:I agree. I told Petersen that, I said I wasnot gonna do a thing about Dean, treat himlike anybody else--that's that. If he doesnot agree with the idea that he should be gone and so forth. Dean has not yetcooperated, you know what I mean.HALDEMAN:You got one sticky wicket there. Dean is,has the administrative responsibility for the Secret Service, who in the TechnicalSecurity Division had the responsibility forall document protection and, and, uh, White House guards.PRESIDENT:Well?HALDEMAN:Des-, destruction of confidential trash. PRESIDENT:Well, let me say this, we also have, though,a top flight fellow that's from the WhiteHouse detail.UNKNOWN ENTERS UNKNOWN:I heard the helicopter will be here shortly.You indicated earlier that you wanted to seeDick Moore.PRESIDENT:Huh? UNKNOWN:He's with Mr. Ziegler right now.PRESIDENT:Oh, I see, yeah. Well, I'll let you know.UNKNOWN:Fine. PRESIDENT:Yeah, uh, that's, uh... HALDEMAN:Well, the White House...PRESIDENT:Let me ask you this...APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 12:16 TO 12:34 P.M.7HALDEMAN:The White House detail doesn't come underthat, we're not talking about that. We'retalking about Technical Security Division.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Which is a different matter, and theExecutive Protection Service.PRESIDENT:Dean's just busy with other things and thatyou want to handle it another way. You can do that.HALDEMAN:That'll send a signal to Dean.PRESIDENT:Well, I don't think its that much of aproblem.(Unintelligible with background noise, twominutes/REMOVED)PRESIDENT:Let me say on the Moore (unintelligible) Iwould enjoy a frank talk with him about LaCosta. There's no reason why we can't. Weought to tell Moore this (unintelligible) the Special Counsel to the President (unintelligible) and basically we simplycan't con firm (unintelligible). Of course,I talked to Petersen today about Dean's relationship. I said, "After all, Dean's acounsel" and I said, "yes he does have to *testify with regard to the commission of a crime."EHRLICHMAN:I'm sure that's so. His own acts--sure.PRESIDENT:His own acts for the information with regardto others who have been involved.HALDEMAN:...except his clients.EHRLICHMAN:...except his clients.HALDEMAN:But there you are. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) his client is not, Ifigure, is not a member of the White Housestaff.EHRLICHMAN:Well, is the client's (unintelligible) notpart of the client when acting upon it, uh,on behalf of the client?APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 12:16 TO 12:34 P.M.8HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Don't you think you couldhave a little talk with Dick on that point(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Hmm.PRESIDENT:Wonder if he's out there now.EHRLICHMAN:I wish I talked to him last week. I can'tvery well now, I don't think. I think you could now.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And I wish you could pass a message for me. PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Which is this--that, that, my, at least, myrecollection of La Costa was that you gave us the responsibility, Bob and me, for producingPRESIDENT:A paper.EHRLICHMAN:...a paper, on the whole Watergate episodethat, that was a, we got them out there...PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:...to aid in developing that document...PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:...that we came back to you afterwards andsaid we can't.PRESIDENT:That's right.APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 12:16 TO 12:34 P.M.9EHRLICHMAN:And my very vivid present recollection isthat Dean was the major impeditor to gettingthat done because of his blocking lines of,lines of, possible bulk.PRESIDENT:All that's covered (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:That the money business was nothing new. Uh,Dean continually, through this period of time, was coming to us on an episonic basis and saying, Jesus, Mitchell needs money andwhat are we gonna do? And invariably andinevitably, with the exception of the one little--of the Herb Kalmbach episode...PRESIDENT:Yeah, he said that.EHRLICHMAN:...we said John, God only knows what he'sgonna do. And my remark about Nelson Rockefeller is typical.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:You know. Tell Mitchell to go borrow itfrom his friend Nelson Rockefeller.PRESIDENT:That's right. Okay, I guess(unintelligible) with that. I think theother, uh, (unintelligible) uh. All right. I call (unintelligible) and Moore on that.EHRLICHMAN:See, our, our sense of this is, throughout,was Dean saying to us nobody in the White House is involved.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And our sense of it being, well look ifMitchell needs money, for whatever reason, that's Mitchell's problem.APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 12:16 TO 12:34 P.M.10PRESIDENT:We were not, uh, basically trying toobstruct justice ourselves.EHRLICHMAN:Nothing...PRESIDENT:We had knowledge of the subject. EHRLICHMAN:I have, I have no interest for instance, inobstructing justice.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:I had no exposure myself, I was satisfiedfrom Dean that no, none of my colleagues inthe White House had exposure and that JebMagruder was a horse's ass and got himself into this.PRESIDENT:I suppose you'd say, morally, that a memberof the White House staff, uh, found Magruder, found somebody else to obstruct the justice sure would(unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Absolutely, absolutely.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) to the prosecutor. EHRLICHMAN:No, no question about it. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) could say that.EHRLICHMAN:I have no evidence of that. I, I did not.I, I had no evidence that anybody, until I entered this thing 30th of March, I had noevidence that any lawyer had induced anydefendant to say anything but what's true.PRESIDENT:In other words, the purpose... HALDEMAN:Still don't know whether (unintelligible)Dean. (Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:The purpose as I understand that's thecondition. I want you, I said I will grantat this time.EHRLICHMAN:Correct.APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 12:16 TO 12:34 P.M.11PRESIDENT:Mitchell's obviously has got some line toMagruder. Somebody--he said I'm not gonnaask Petersen (unintelligible). But theline, marking has got to be we've got to have a line (unintelligible) involved, whichis true. That is, that "the line's chiefpurpose, is to take of defendants and everything else.EHRLICHMAN:Well--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Well, in all candor. Uh, I knew thatMitchell was trying to raise money for thesepeople.PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:And I knew that LaRue was and I knew that&#8218;cause Dean told me so.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:But, Uh, I don't have any personal knowledgeeither from Dean or anybody else of any correction in that process.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:Now, uh, I could raise an inference. PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:You know, but, but bear in mind I didn't...PRESIDENT:You didn't have any reason to think of itbeing raised for an improper purpose until-two things, one until McCord said itwas for payoff purposes and two, until Deancame in (unintelligible) and said that Hunt is shaking us down.EHRLICHMAN:Bob and I have shared a suspicion thatMitchell was at the bottom of all this--APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 12:16 TO 12:34 P.M.12PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:There's no two ways about that.PRESIDENT:That's right. Right.EHRLICHMAN:And we've shared that suspicion for manymonths.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:But Dean, very effectively... PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...kept between me...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...and any intimate knowledge... PRESIDENT:GoodEHRLICHMAN:...of that whole business...PRESIDENT:Good, but, uh, one other situation, uh, uh,the other, the other situation that you've got to think about is to-perennial one wehave here a, where we stand on a, uh, uh, douh, what they call operation surgery. Uh, your lawyers, and our lawyers, these lawyers in the situation of operation surgery tocorrect a wrongdoing, uh, and got to have(unintelligible) Which you, which you think--I suppose, uh, if you want more outof it you'll have to do it eventually, whynot now? That's the thing to look out for.HALDEMAN:If you accept eventually that I would do it,why not now?PRESIDENT:That's right. Exactly--that's why you'vegot to get in with your lawyers on, if they let you...APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 12:16 TO 12:34 P.M.13EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Then, incidently, you've got to think ofyour lawyers (unintelligible) to. There aretwo levels, one legal and two, uh, the gray area.HALDEMAN:Well, I--PRESIDENT:The gray area is God-damn tight. EHRLICHMAN:There's a third... PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:There's a third level to this that'sdeveloping now in the press, particularly that's developing in the New York Times thismorning and that is even if there is no complicity...PRESIDENT:All right. EHRLICHMAN:...the White House staff has to bearresponsibility to the President for havingpermitted this thing to have occurred...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...generally, this is a matter ofstewardship...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...and that their, their managerial capacityis seriously in question, has been put inquestion by this whole chain of events, assuming...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) You're gonna argue it, isthat all right?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think it's gonna be a dull ache allthrough this thing you're gonna hear it,and, uh, and, uh...APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 12:16 TO 12:34 P.M.14PRESIDENT:You, you think you, you can easily discardit.EHRLICHMAN:I think, uh, something you ought to givesome thought to as to whether we can or not. I don't know, I mean I just noticed it thismorning for the first time and I don't haveHALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. HALDEMAN:If you start into that then you're sayingthat we have to accept responsibility forthe commission of the Watergate and for anything else that may ever develop that thecampaign did.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I... HALDEMAN:That's wrong. EHRLICHMAN:I don't know for (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:We had clear and specific responsibilitiesin certain areas. I reviewed advertising, they couldn't run an ad, until I signed off on it. They couldn't publish a positionpaper or a document on issues until Johnsigned on it, uh, but I had no authority over the budget...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:I had no authority over the fieldorganization or Personnel hiring or firing, uh, over political strategy, policy,telephone operations.PRESIDENT:No. Well, let me say this... HALDEMAN:Or anything else...APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 12:16 TO 12:34 P.M.15PRESIDENT:You got to take one step at a time. Thefirst step is to do exactly what you'redoing.HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:The lawyers--what the hell, where you'regonna come out.HALDEMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:The second step then is to talk about this,the area about, uh, what type depending onwhat your lawyers do with it eventually, oreventually, why not now (unintelligible). And third area is your, your, your kind ofconsidering and so on, my own point. Idon't buy any of it except the first one, the first one, of course, uh, I mean eventually why not now. I mean if it'sclear better than an even chance it's gonnamove certain directions and I think it's well to not--HALDEMAN:Absolutely.PRESIDENT:That's your theory too, isn't it, John?EHRLICHMAN:Absolutely, absolutely. Well and that, uh,that's gonna be an evaluation we ought tomake every day.PRESIDENT:Day to day. EHRLICHMAN:Every day will be different. PRESIDENT:Day to day. Still won't know what, what theGod-damned case is about...EHRLICHMAN:Still don't. PRESIDENT:Well, I think that's such a silly thing.It's a-well, the lawyers don't know. Ididn't ask Petersen. I don't think I'm gonna ask him about this.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Should we?APRIL 20, 1973 FROM 12:16 TO 12:34 P.M.16EHRLICHMAN:It's very helpful to our guys-uh, uh some ofthese things, uh, are, are and to the extentthat you can that's helpful, but, uh. Allright. I understand.PRESIDENT:Grand Jury(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Be sure(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Oh, he did, I just called him today. HALDEMAN:Just give us a call if (unintelligible) PRESIDENT:On La Costa, I think maybe I'll just, uh, isMoore out here? Yeah, yeah.(Unintelligible) He wants you to go on with him. Good. Okay.UNIDENTIFIED:Have a good journey. Good luck.PRESIDENT:Now, look you (unintelligible), I wish youwould go to Camp David (unintelligible). A great man with the great men.(Unintelligible)
