It's...PRESIDENT:...John, that's... EHRLICHMAN:...It's a little touchy and I don't...PRESIDENT:John, that's...EHRLICHMAN:...and I don't know how far I can go. PRESIDENT:...not going to, uh, that's not going tohelp you. Look, he's gotta look down theroad to, to one point, that, uh, there's only one man that could restore him to the ability to practice law in the case thingsstill go wrong.EHRLICHMAN:Um hum. Um hum. PRESIDENT:Now that uh, uh, he's got to have that inthe back of his mind.EHRLICHMAN:Um hum.PRESIDENT:And he's got to know that'll happen. Youknow, I don't, you don't tell himEHRLICHMAN:Um hum.PRESIDENT:but you know and I know that EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.APRIL 14 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.22PRESIDENT:with him and Mitchell, there isn't gonna bea God damn question. Because we got a bum rap. God damn it if Lipschitz gets off witha...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...with copping a plea...EHRLICHMAN:(Laughs)PRESIDENT:...and, and, and getting a suspendedsentence, what in the name of Christ is this all about. well" what it involves, ofcourse, we have to be fair, it involves, uh,the highest...EHRLICHMAN:The king of the mountain...PRESIDENT:The king of the mountain...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...the, uh, trying to keep, uh, suppress thefacts and so forth. I do, and I think youthought I was sort of, sort of beingfacetious about saying get everybody, all these people and this includes LaRue, and Mardian and of course uh, of courseKalmbach. Uh, they've gotta have it andDean too. They've gotta have a straight damn line that, of course we raised money.Be very honest about it. But, uh, we raisedmoney for a purpose that we thought was perfectly proper.EHRLICHMAN:Um hum. Uh hum.PRESIDENT:But we didn't want to shut 'em up. Thesemen were guilty.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Right?EHRLICHMAN:Right.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.23PRESIDENT:And uh, they are, we weren't trying to shutthem up, we just didn't, we didn't want 'em to talk to the press.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah.PRESIDENT:That's perfectly legitimate, isn't it? Oris it? Legitimate not to want them to talkto the press.EHRLICHMAN:I think it is. I uh, I, I don't have aperfect understanding of the, of the law on that and I...PRESIDENT:You'd say that old Dick was really shaken?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:He really was.PRESIDENT:God damn it. I, I told him once, I said,"Dick, I said, the real target here is Mitchell." He said, "Oh no, it can't be."You know, now, he's sort of got the idea, Ithink, that probably it's Haldeman or Colson.EHRLICHMAN:Well, he uh, he, I'm sure he's going to callme first thing in the morning.PRESIDENT:Yeah. But with him I would be very tough,I'd say, "Dick, uh, let's not crap around, Imean, they're after Mitchell and they'regoing to get him, at the present time. At least that's what our evidence, that's what, what our information...EHRLICHMAN:Um hum.PRESIDENT:"...indicates EHRLICHMAN:Um hum.PRESIDENT:...and so here's where we go."EHRLICHMAN:And he's probably doing a little checkingwith his U.S. Attorney tonight.PRESIDENT:He'd do that?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.24EHRLICHMAN:Oh sure, sure. He has to make the ultimateprosecutive decision or else he has to del, delegate it to somebody. So he's entitledto know-PRESIDENT:Your point is that he would delegate to theDean. I think the Dean is the best one todelegate it to.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, I do too. PRESIDENT:Rather than you know, rather than, John, thesuggestion that well you resign and thenwe'll put another Attorney General. Thatwould be a,...EHRLICHMAN:Um hum.PRESIDENT:...that would be a hell of an admission thatChrist, that we thought...EHRLICHMAN:He, he isn't gonna want to do that would bemy guess. He isn't gonna want to resign atthis point.PRESIDENT:He shouldn't, uh, you know, when I come tothink about it. I think that he should for other reasons. But uh, Jesus, if we couldget the Ellsberg case over, I'd just like toget that FBI guy.EHRLICHMAN:Um hum, uh hum.PRESIDENT:Is there any way at all that you can?You're going to talk to Ziegler-that you can get out the fact that you, you have conducted a thorough investigation?EHRLICHMAN:We'll work on that. I think there is.PRESIDENT:I think we have to get that out... EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:...don't you?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.25EHRLICHMAN:I think so.PRESIDENT:The President is calling the signals. EHRLICHMAN:I, I suspect that somebody's going to put ittogether. I, my, hunch is the New YorkTimes will. They're going to put together, you see, they have the story that Colson wasin yesterday.PRESIDENT:And they know that Mitchell was in. EHRLICHMAN:And, of course, the, all the wires have thatMitchell was in today.PRESIDENT:They have? Um hum.EHRLICHMAN:So, uh, somebody's going to start stringingall this together.PRESIDENT:And so what would happen? You'd haveZiegler or yourself go out and say, "Yes, I have seen them." Or you, haven't thought that through.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think I'd, I wouldn't have to sayI'd seen them. I could a, we could a, say that uh we, we've had a job of work going on for several weeks .PRESIDENT:But you can say that the President, becauseof the charges that have been made, wanted an independent investigation made. And heordered, directed you to make it.EHRLICHMAN:Um hum. PRESIDENT:You've made an independent investigation ofthe situation, because the President wants,if there's anybody is, who is guilty in thisthing, he said, uh, he must through the Judicial processes be brought to, brought tothe bar. Is that what you'd say?APRIL 14 1973 FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.26EHRLICHMAN:Yep. Well, or, or simply to aid you in uh,in uh, analyzing the steps that ought to be taken here. You're, you're being asked todo a lot...PRESIDENT:You could say the President... EHRLICHMAN:...of quite extraordinary things.PRESIDENT:You could say, "The President, Presidentwants this matter cleaned up, once and for all."EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:It's been hanging around and yacked aboutand innocent people have been hurt in the process...EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:...and charges are being throwing around nowwe've got a Judicial process and we want this thing...EHRLICHMAN:Beyond that...PRESIDENT:...finished. EHRLICHMAN:...beyond that you've had all kinds ofSenators and Congressmen calling for theappointment of uh,...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...of uh, special commissions and all thatkind of thing...PRESIDENT:So you're it. EHRLICHMAN:...for, for, uh' you uh, to come to any sortof a judgment on those kinds of proposalsyou have to, have a pretty clearunderstanding of the facts.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.27PRESIDENT:Right. Well, with Dean, I think you couldtalk to him in confidence about uh, about a thing like that, don't you? He isn'tgonna...EHRLICHMAN:I'm not sure. I, I just don't know how, howmuch to lean on...PRESIDENT:I see.EHRLICHMAN:...that reed at the moment. But, uh, I'llsound it out.PRESIDENT:Well, you start with the proposition, "Dean,uh, the President thinks you've just been a'you know, you've carried a tremendous load and he has, his affection and loyalty to you is just undiminished...EHRLICHMAN:Alright.PRESIDENT:"...And uh, now let's see where the hell wego and...EHRLICHMAN:Uh Hum.PRESIDENT:"...we can't get the President involved inthis." His people, just, I mean that's one thing we don't want to cover up, but uh...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...uh, there are ways that he can and thenhe's got to say that, that, for example, youstart with him certainly on the business ofthe obstruction of justice.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. That's right. PRESIDENT:Say, "Look John, let's, we need a planhere...EHRLICHMAN:Um hum. PRESIDENT:"...And uh,...EHRLICHMAN:Um hum.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.28PRESIDENT:&#64258;...so that uh, so that LaRue, Mardian anda, a, the others." I mean Christ, uh...EHRLICHMAN:Well. I'm not sure I can go that far withhim.PRESIDENT:No. He can't make the plan up EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) I'll sound it out.PRESIDENT:Right. Well, get a good night's sleep.EHRLICHMAN:Thank you sir. PRESIDENT:I'll bet you do... EHRLICHMAN:Alright.PRESIDENT:...sleep well. And if you don't have a way,it's a curious thing, uh, not curious at all but uh, John it's, it's, it's just, it'swell, it's terribly painful of course, and Iwas thinking you know, to have, to go to that damn dinner tonight.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:But my point is, well, it is painful and Ijust feel better about getting the God damn thing done.EHRLICHMAN:Good.PRESIDENT:Or, or do you agree?EHRLICHMAN:Absolutely. PRESIDENT:And after all, I'm, it's my job and I don'twant this, I don't want the Presidencytarnished, but also I don't, I, I, I'm a law enforcement man.EHRLICHMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:And, right?EHRLICHMAN:Yep, and you've got to move on to moreimportant things.
