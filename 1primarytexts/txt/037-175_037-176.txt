DEAN:I absolutely have to have it tomorrow.There just can't be any further deadline.The time is here to look and see what you've got and he said, "Well, I think I've gotgood stuff. I think it's supportable,(unintelligible).&#64258; I said, "Well, Bill, I want to see it just as quickly as possible tomorrow morning."MARCH 20, 1973, FROM 7:29 TO 7:43 P.M.4PRESIDENT:Good.DEAN:Cause it will be over. And the other witnessthey've now subpoenaed--there are two otherwitnesses--there's the Hoback girl from the Re-Election Committee, who, she wasinterrogated by Committee staff and counselas a result of her confidential,, uh, interviews with the FBI--alleging that that had been leaked by me to them and then, ofcourse,, that was notPRESIDENT:That's not true. DEAN:...not true. And the other fellow they'recalling is a fellow by the name of ThomasLumbard who is trying to establish a link between Dean on that one. Lombard did volunteer work for me in my office and, uh,and, uh, did volunteer work for Liddy and atone time he saw Liddy in my office. Big deal. (Unintelligible) purely campaign, uh. you know.PRESIDENT:Well, is that what Lumbard wil" testify to,or will he testify to, uh...DEAN:Well that's what he&#8482;ll&#352;he&#8482;s, he's written avery lengthy letter to the Committee asking,declining to testify originally and saying this is all I would have to say and it&#8482;s obviously not relevant. I know nothing ofDean and Liddy's...PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:...connection...PRESIDENT:Yeah, right.DEAN:...other than the fact that they...MARCH 20, 1973, FROM 7:29 TO 7:43 P.M.5PRESIDENT:That's not bad then. Maybe he'll make apretty good witness.DEAN:He might. He might. Uh...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) the Hoback girl? DEAN:The Hoback girl should, uh, be broken down.She should come out in tears as a result ofthe fact that she's virtually lying about what she's saying. And, uh, our people will, beyond a...PRESIDENT:Well, mean, do our people know what to askher?DEAN:Yes, they do. Yes, they do.PRESIDENT:Um hmm.DEAN:Uh... PRESIDENT:Why is she doing it? Do we know? DEAN:She, uh...PRESIDENT:Disgruntled? Somebody...DEAN:Disgruntled. She's been fairly disgruntledall along. She's, she's a Democrat that worked over there in the Finance Committee.She professes a personal loyalty to MauryStans but that is about the extent of it, (unintelligible) loyalty.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:I never did figure out how she got in there.Uh, so, all tolled I'm told that today was a bad day for Gray and, uh, not much of a, uhPRESIDENT:(Laugh)DEAN:...(unintelligible). They're taking awhip...PRESIDENT:Yeah.MARCH 20, 1973, FROM 7:29 TO 7:43 P.M.6DEAN:...out on the floor to see what the(unintelligible) there.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:We'll have that tomorrow morning. PRESIDENT:What's your feeling, though, John, aboutGray? Uh, aren't you, just as comfortableto let him go down?DEAN:I don't, I don't PRESIDENT:Which do you want? I mean, we can, we can,put some pressures on, and, uh., I,, I justwonder.DEAN:I don't think it's worth saving, sir. Ireally don't.PRESIDENT:Yeah, well that's my point. Isn't it reallya case of-if they, they want to make him the martyr, they're gonna make him the martyr.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Do you agree or not or er... DEAN:I would... PRESIDENT:You feel differently, let me know.DEAN:I would, I would agree that they're tryingto make him a martyr. I think that, that Pat Gray's been so damaged by these hearingsthat he will...PRESIDENT:shouldn't be the head of the Bureau. DEAN:...will be difficult for him to be the headof the Bureau.MARCH 20, 1973, FROM 7:29 TO 7:43 P.M.7PRESIDENT:That's right.DEAN:It will be a year, two years for him torecover.PRESIDENT:That's right. DEAN:It's like Dick Poff when he decided towithdraw even from consideration for thecourt knowing that there had never been an effective justice for years.PRESIDENT:That's right. The thing is too--that Graythough has got to make up his mind on thatpretty soon. Don't you think so?DEAN:I would--you know, I thought I'd be acalled...PRESIDENT:In fact, I, I was thinking you ought to doit fairly soon.DEAN:Um hmm.PRESIDENT:Excuse me, what were you gonna say?DEAN:I was, I was thinking he might call today,very easily, and say, uh, uh, you know, at least make a pro forma gesture to see if,uh, someone over there--you know, if youwere interested. Now...PRESIDENT:What's the Kleindienst view of the wholething now? Is he stayin' a mile away?DEAN:I'll talk to, to Dick tonight. I don'tknow...PRESIDENT:Um huh.DEAN:...what his reading is on (unintelligible)activity.PRESIDENT:Yeah.MARCH 20, 1973, FROM 7:29 TO 7:43 P.M.8DEAN:It's uh, uh, it might be better to let itjust die in...PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:...Committee and not get it out of there.Apparently, there's--it's tied up atseven-seven now. (Unintelligible) thevotes.PRESIDENT:Oh, it is seven to seven in the Committee? DEAN:That's right. And, uh, McClellan andEastland, uh, are hanging in, not knowingwhich way--not--McClellan and Mathias are hanging in the balance.PRESIDENT: Umph.DEAN:I suspect we could probably get McClellan'svote and lose Mathias'.PRESIDENT:It will be eight to eight, huh?DEAN: Right.PRESIDENT:(Laughs) DEAN:That ties it up and that will not confirmit. (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well, if ya got it out, yeah.McClellan surprises me. Good God, he knows better than this.DEAN:He's, he's turned a little funny recently.He's generally you know, pretty much of a soldier on...MARCH 20, 1973, FROM 7:29 TO 7:43 P.M.9PRESIDENT:What's his trouble, for Christ's sake. He'sjust got re-elected and I helped him.DEAN:I know it.PRESIDENT:One hell of a lot. DEAN:I know it. I know it.PRESIDENT:Well...DEAN:Well, he&#8482;s, you know... PRESIDENT:getting old. DEAN:That's right (laugh)PRESIDENT:That's right. Yeah. Well on that score Idon't consider this too bad a day. I think maybe that's the way the dreary thing'sgonna roll itself out, isn't it?DEAN:It's, uh, uh, I think, I think this will bea self-terminating situation. It will just be a, uh, no end andPRESIDENT:But, they didn't bite the bullet with regardto subpoenaing you?DEAN:No. I don't think there&#8482;s any chancethey're going to do that.PRESIDENT:That's rather interesting, isn't it?Something ought to be made of that.DEAN:Unless they, uh, get--they're taking moreevidence on me, obviously, with, uh-- theseother two witnesses. Uh, not (unintelligible) just be more.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:Same stuff. Uh, I. I had a conversationwith, uh, John Ehrlichman this afternoon before he came down toMARCH 20, 1973, FROM 7:29 TO 7:43 P.M.10DEAN:visit you, and, I, I think that oneCONT:thing we have to continually do andparticularly right now, is examine thebroadest, broadest implications of this whole thing, and I, you know, maybe 30minutes, of just my recitation to you of...PRESIDENT:Um hmm. DEAN:...the facts so that you operate from thesame facts that everybody else has.PRESIDENT:Right.DEAN:And I don't think--we've, we've never reallydone that. It's been sort of bits andpieces. Just paint the whole picture foryou, the soft spots, the, the, uh, potential problem areasPRESIDENT:Um hmm.DEAN:a like. So that, uh, when you, when you,make judgments you'll...PRESIDENT: Yeah DEAN:...have all that (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Would you like to do that, uh--when?DEAN:Uh, I would think, uh, uh, if its notinconvenient for you, sir, I would I wouldlike to sort of draw all my thoughtstogether and have a, you know, just make a couple notes to myself so I didn't...PRESIDENT:Well, could you do it, could you do it,could you do it, tomorrow?MARCH 20, 1973, FROM 7:29 TO 7:43 P.M.11DEAN:Yes, sir. Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:Um hmm.then we could probably do it, say,aroundten o'clock.DEAN:That would be fine, sir. PRESIDENT:How about--you just want to do it alone?Want anybody else there?DEAN:I think, I think just uh,... PRESIDENT:It is better with nobody else there, isn'tit?DEAN:Absolutely, I think that's a good way.PRESIDENT:Anybody, anybody else you--they're allparties in interest, virtually.DEAN:That&#8482;s right.PRESIDENT:Right. Fine. The other thing I was goingto say is this, that, uh--just for your own thinking, uh, I still want to see, though,you know, you and Dick, I guess, have stillworked on your letter and all that sort of thing?DEAN:We are and (laughs) we're coming and-- themore we work on it the more questions we seethat, uh,PRESIDENT:You don't want to answer.DEAN:...uh, are creating problems by answering.PRESIDENT:And so, so, you're coming up, then, with theidea of just a stonewall then? Is that...DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Is that what you, re come down with?MARCH 20, 1973, FROM 7:29 TO 7:43 P.M.12DEAN:A stonewall, with lots of noises that we arealways willing to cooperate, but no one'sasking us for anything to, uh...PRESIDENT:And they never will, huh? But, you know,there's no way that you could make even ageneral statement, uh, that I couldput--You, you, understand what I'm do...DEAN:I think, I think we could, uh PRESIDENT:See, for example, I was even thinking, ifyou could even--to, the Cabinet, theleaders, you know, just you--just orally say, "I have looked into this, and this isthat" period, so that people get sorta afeeling that--you know, your own people gotta be reassured.DEAN:Um hmm.PRESIDENT:Could you do that?DEAN:Well, I think I can, but I don't think you'dwant to make that decision until we have about a...PRESIDENT:No, I wanna know. I wanna know where allthe bodies are first.DEAN:Right, and then, uh, once you decide afterthat,...PRESIDENT:Yeah.MARCH 20, 1973, FROM 7:29 TO 7:43 P.M.13DEAN:...we can program it anyway you want it to(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yeah. Because I, I think, for example, youcould do orally, for example, uh, even if you don't want to make the writtenstatement, you could do orally with the(unintelligible) Cabinet, and, the leaders and the rest. You can lay it all out and say, "Look I"&#352;- I, I would not be present.You just lay it all out and I just--see whatI mean?DEAN:Um hmm.PRESIDENT:Now that is one thing. The other thing isthat in -- I do think there is something to be said for this, not maybe this complete answer to this fellow, but maybe just awritten statement to me. You know, saying(laughs) my conclusions are this: bing, bing, bing, bing.DEAN:Um hmm.PRESIDENT:Even that's a possibility. Sol what I meanis we need something to answer somebody, answer things with. You know they say that"What are you basing this on&#64258;, you can say,"Well, I've exam-- my counsel has advised me that"--Is that possible or not? Or are you...DEAN:Well I--you know that there, there&#8482;s,there&#8482;s that--and there's always the FBI report which, uh, we have probably notrelied upon enough. But, there's not onescintilla of evidence.MARCH 20, 1973, FROM 7:29 TO 7:43 P.M.14PRESIDENT:I know. But I mean, can't you say that? Ordo you want to put it out?DEAN:Uh, yes it, it could be said, and it issomething we haven't really emphasized. Pat Gray is the only person that has said it andit has really never gotten picked up.PRESIDENT:Yeah. How would you do it then? What Imeant, isn't that, isn't that something that you could say? (Unintelligible) want topublish the FBI report?DEAN:Oh, no. Oh, no... PRESIDENT:Then, then...DEAN:...because in our, our own...PRESIDENT:Fine. Right. DEAN:...structures we're trying to place on it(unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:But, what, but, but, but you could say, "I,I had this and and this is that.&#64258; What I am getting at is that, if apart from a statement to the Committee or anything else,if you could just make a statement to methat, that we could use. You know, for internal purposes and to answer and soforth.DEAN:As we did when you, back in August, made thestatement thatPRESIDENT:That's right.DEAN:...(unintelligible) all the things.PRESIDENT:You've got to have, you've got to havesomething where...DEAN:(Unintelligible).MARCH 20, 1973, FROM 7:29 TO 7:43 P.M.15PRESIDENT:...where it doesn&#8482;t appear that I'm justdoing this, uh, you know, just, in a, ina--saying to hell with the Congress and thehell with the people, we&#8482;re not going to tell you anything because of ExecutivePrivilege. That they don't understand. Butif you say, "No, we are willing to cooperate, and he's made a complete&#64258;-you've made a complete statement, you see, but makeit very incomplete. See, that's what Imean. I don't want a, quite too much in chapter and verse as you did, in yourother--your letter, I just want, just ageneral...DEAN:...general (unintelligible). Lemme, uh... PRESIDENT:Try just something general.DEAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:"I have checked into this matter; I can saycategorically, based on my investigation, the following: Haldeman is not involved inthis that and the otherthing; Mr. Colsondid not do this and Mr. so and so did not do this and Mr. Blank did not do this.&#64258; andd--, d--, d--, right down the line. See,taking the most glaring things.DEAN:Um, hmm. PRESIDENT:&#64257;If there are any further questions, pleaselet me know.&#64258; See?DEAN:Um hmm.I think we can do that. PRESIDENT:That's one possibility, and then if youcould say that such things--and then use theFBT report to the Cabinet and leaders,MARCH 20, 1973, FROM 7:29 TO 7:43 P.M.16PRESIDENT:it might be very salutary. Just,CONT:see our own people have gotta haveconfidence or they are not going to step upand defend us. You see my problem--see our problem there don't you?DEAN:And I think, uh, at the same time it wouldbe good to brief these people on what Executive Privilege means, so they can go out and speak about it.PRESIDENT:That's right.DEAN:Some of them are floundering, uh,... PRESIDENT:And why it's necessary.DEAN:Uh, I started having somebody in my officetoday prepare some material that can be put out by the Congressional people so they can understand, people (unintelligible) defendus have a piece of paperPRESIDENT:Sure. DEAN:...that they know they can talk from as towhat it all...PRESIDENT:Pointing out that we're defending theConstitution, it's the responsibility, the, uh, uh, separation of powers, and that wehave to do it, distinguishing the Adam'scase and ignoring Flanigan (laughs).DEAN:(Laughs)MARCH 20, 1973, FROM 7:29 TO 7:43 P.M.17PRESIDENT:Which is one we shouldn&#8482;t have never agreedto. But nevertheless--Anyway, uh, let'sthink a little about that, but we'll see youat ten o'clock tomorrow.DEAN:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:Fine.DEAN:Alright, sir. PRESIDENT:Alright, fine. DEAN:Good night.PRESIDENT:Take the evening off.DEAN:(Laughs) Alright.
