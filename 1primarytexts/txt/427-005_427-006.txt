I don't know. It may havebeen told him in my presence or not, Ijust'.PRESIDENT:But, you think he was told?

Ah and uh again, I can't (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible with tape noise)EHRLICHMAN:Could say, you know, it may be that hisstory is I opened it and it was full of paper napkins or, or, uh, you know, some damn thing. (Tape noise) But if he says Iwas not in Ehrlichman's office and I did notreceive a big manila envelope from Dean, then I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have todispute that. (Tape noise) Saw em do it.(Tape noise) If their men do thatPRESIDENT:They apprehended him? EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.(Tape noise)PRESIDENT:Has he testified to that, John, or do youthink-EHRLICHMAN:He told the U.S. Attorney that.PRESIDENT:That what? EHRLICHMAN:That he gave him an envelope there that wasthe contents of the Hunt safe.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) (Tape noise)EHRLICHMAN:Yeah-uh, Dick Howard just got a subpoenafrom the Grand Jury.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 4:02 P.M.3PRESIDENT:Yeah. (Tape noise)EHRLICHMAN:The FBI agent who called said, Uh "I'm comingover to serve you with a subpoena from the Grand Jury, Mr. Howard. You may want to go and talk with NO. Dean, uh, in case you want to get any advice.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Did he talk to Dean? (Tape noise),EHRLICHMAN:No, fortunately, he talked to Colson. Colson,uh, had told him that Dean was over the hill, (unintelligible, tape noise) cautioned him, and then he told me and said, "Boy, you got, you got an outpost over there. Well, (tape noise) U.S.Attorney's having the FBI agents send everybodya subpoena to go talk to Dean.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Because he was (unintelligible) the practice. EHRLICHMAN:Well, I hope that's what they thought, but prob--more probab1y they'd like Dean to, to sit there and listen to the guy's story and then, uh, uh call over and let them know, uh, what's goingon.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible, tape noise) Dean(unintelligible) apparently he's-(Tape noise)EHRLICHMAN:I must caution you about that because it'scertainly improper for him to be counselling anyof our people.PRESIDENT:I've got to talk to him. He's got to quitcounselling anybody right now.EHRLICHMAN:Let me, let me finish this, uh... PRESIDENT:Oh, sure, John. Did (tape noise) want to tellyou about the other because that he'll be comingto ask you about it. I'm not asking you to makeup any story, but I'm just simply saying, for God's sakes. I just can't (tape noise, unintelligible) goddamned dumb Gray, the Director of the FBI, in the position of having two White House peop1e say he got an envelopeand he doesn't remember it. I heard you talkedto him. What did he say to you last night?APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 4:02 P.M.4EHRLICHMAN:He said he can't say that.PRESIDENT:What did he say to you though? EHRLICHMAN:(unintelligible) he said, I said uh, um... PRESIDENT:After (unintel1igible). EHRLICHMAN:Dean, Dean, was saying so and so, and he said"He can't say that.&#64258; And I said, he a1readyhas. But he said, "I destroyed it.&#64258; Well,(tape noise) that's it. Uh, you know, that's uh, pretty (tape noise) tough he's (unintelligible) if he does and (tape noise) damned if he doesn't not. (Unintelligible) sure putting the best face on what they did toStrachan over there. Questioned by theprosecutors. Despite considerable fencing, he refused to discuss the matter and was excused by the prosecutor. According to Strachan, uh, then they, you mustn't say anything to anybody about this because I suppose he wasn't supposed to call over here.PRESIDENT:Uh-I-I...EHRLICHMAN:He called, he called to get advice. He saidthey really worked him over, said stuff as, "Listen, Strachan, you're going to jail; think about your wife, think about your baby and how would you like to be disbarred, and...&#64258;PRESIDENT:I know. I know.EHRLICHMAN:You know, that kind of stuff. PRESIDENT:I knew they were going to work him over. (Tapenoise) He asked for a lawyer?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, no, they asked him to get a lawyer. Theykept stressing it. They wanted him to get alawyer and I think what they're doing is settinghim up for immunity.PRESIDENT:Well. That safe, John, something about thegoddamned notebooks (unintelligible, tape noise) he said, notebook.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, I know. He's said that right along.PRESIDENT:And there were?EHRLICHMAN:Oh, I don't know. I honestly don't. Now,Kehrli and the Secret Service agents were there when that safe was opened and, uh,APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 4:02 P.M.5(Tape noise) (Unintelligible)EHRIICHMAN:I never tried to appoint myself for that.(Tape Noise) So they're still on this, uh...PRESIDENT:That's your only vulnerability, John. EHRLICHMAN:...deep six and, uh, (unintelligible) FBIbusiness and, uh, Liddy. Well, that'sinteresting that, that Dean would take that remark and go out and act on it.(Tape noise)PRESIDENT:Deep sixing?EHRLICHMAN:No, the Liddy deal.(Tape noise)PRESIDENT:Told (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:(unintelligible) Yeah, yeah, that it camethrough Dean.(Tape Noise)PRESIDENT:But, but apparently they didn't leave inother words you were...EHRLICHMAN:Oh, no. No, no. PRESIDENT:...you were discussing it. I told you that.I tried to tell well, Petersen, "Well, lookit, I can imagine it, they were discussing it," he said "Jesus Christ, you ought toleave the country, I, uh maybe we ought todeep six it."EHRLICHMAN:Mmhuh. PRESIDENT:And you didn't do any of those things.(Pause, tape noise)At least I think that's based on... Got anythoughts on this point?or...(unintelligible)(ZIEGLER ENTERS)PRESIDENT:Who have you talked to? ZIEGLER:Yes, sir. I talked to, uh, Moore...PRESIDENT: Yeah.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 4:02 P.M.6ZIEGLER:Chappie Rose. Both of them are against it.PRESIDENT:They're against it? All right.ZIEGLER:...from the stan...PRESIDENT:What because of the reasons you mentioned?ZIEGLER:Some of those. But Rose their best lawyer isworking on that and and...PRESIDENT:Okay.ZIEGLER:His concern...PRESIDENT:We just won't try to get out in front. We gotanything else you can say? Don't say, don't we- we seem to, we've gotten into enough troubleby saying nothing so we'll say nothing today.You know, actually, thank God we haven't, thank God we haven't had a Haldeman statement.Believe me. (Unintelligible) thank God wedidn't get a Dean report. Right? Thank God.So, we've done a few things right. Don't sayanything.ZIEGLER:Rose made the point, looking at the statement,(tape noise) about comments and so forth thatstampede...(tape noise)PRESIDENT:Well, I (unintelligible). I've got anunderstanding, John, that uh, that uh, withPetersen, and he wants us to move first and uh(tape noise) but I said, "Well not beforeMagruder pleads."" We've got to go out andwhat I had in mind of having you say quicklythat (unintelligible) false statement. But inany event, I think we're going to have to wait for the Magruder thing. The point is you'vegot the whole record. Uh, I just don'twant...EHRLICHMAN:He wants to wait until Magruder talks? Is thatit?PRESIDENT:Petersen?EHRLICHMAN:No, I mean uh, the others who...ZIEGLER:Well, he didn't get into any, involved in anydiscussions about Magruder talking. No.EHRLICHMAN:What was his objection?APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 4:02 P.M.7ZIEGLER:His point is that, what Rose's point is, in theposition of stampeding on the Magruder thing howthis has been (unintelligible) this. But this point, the President is too closely tied in as an investigator and too clope1y tied in to the Grand Jury proceeding itself. In other words the most expensive dream (tape noise, Unintelligible) His feeling is that you have the first twist and suggest that the President is becoming...PRESIDENT:Affecting that? I don't know.ZIEGLER:No, not affect. But the President is becoming asan investigator involved in knowledge and awareness of the Grand Jury proceedings.PRESIDENT:Oh, yeah. Yeah. ZIEGLER:Which well could affect direction of thoseproceedings.EHRLICHMAN:He has contacted Petersen?PRESIDENT:Well, all the facts are going to show justotherwise though when it comes out, but go ahead. But this (unintelligible)...(tape noise)ZIEGLER:I think so.(Tape noise, unintelligible conversation)PRESIDENT:He didn't. John, I asked about Magruder today andthey haven't got the deal with him yet because Magruder's attorneys insist on something with Ervinand something with Sirica. Magruder doesn't wantto go to the D.C. Jail. The black guys in there. They haven't worked that out yet. I asked about the timing on Dean. They haven't got a deal on him because uh, (unintelligible), in fact (tape noise) his lawyers made an interesting comment. He said, "Dean didn't do anything to upset the unmaking of Haldeman and Ehr1ichman and Mitchell, and if they don't get immunity, they're going to try this Administration and the President.&#64258; (Unintelligible)his lawyer, (tape noise) Schaffer. Petersen says that's quite common. Everybody shouts at everybody. I'm getting (unintelligible) difficult (unintelligible) difficult (unintelligible). (Tape noise) The fact that all the business, the crap about the Dean report, why end it tat way? Dean will stick to the position,APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 4:02 P.M.8PRESIDENT (cont.) John, you can see how he's going to(uninte1ligible) Ehrlichman. You know, he didmake some movement on his own in this thing.(Unintelligible) is that I&#8482;ve asked Dean aspecific question. "Haldeman/ Ehrlichman, didthey know in advance?&#64258; He said, "No."" I said, "I've asked you again, I've asked you.&#64258;He told me that (unintelligible) this shit.Have you got that? Well, Dean said after asecond meeting over there he went over and sawHaldeman and uh said, uh "We oughtn't to be inthis shit, and Haldeman said, "I agree.&#64258; Isaid, "Oh, what's wrong with that?&#64258; He said, "Well, Haldeman, uh, by failing to act-"...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, that is (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Dean states Haldeman agreed, but apparently noinitiating of any instructions.PRESIDENT:Right. By failing to act. And then, then Isaid, uh, I said, "Well, how, how could heact? He wasn't in charge of the campaign and,uh (tape noise) didn't he have budget approval?&#64258; "Why," I said, "No. He had noresponsibility at all. The campaign wastotally out of the White House.&#64258; But Isuppose what he meant by that, Haldeman shouldshould have cal1ed Mitchel1 and said, "Knockit off."' Is that what they're spying, John?Well, what, what, what does Haldeman say to that sort of thing?EHRLICHMAN:That's, that's hard to get around, I mean,it's hard to understand, because Dean's story,consistently, has been that at every one ofthose meetings, the plan was disapproved byMitchell.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:(Tape noise)What's there to get out of?PRESIDENT:By going to Haldeman... EHRLICHMAN:Dean came back and said, "Well there was aproposal, and Mitchell disapproved it."PRESIDENT:You think he's making that up?APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 4:02 P.M.9EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. I, I uh, uh it doesn't makesense, in the context of those meetings,that everybody agrees on, that at all thosemeetings Dean attended it ended in disapproval.PRESIDENT:Yeah. (tape noise) "Well, why did he go toHaldeman?"EHRLICHMAN:So why? Yeah. Why, why is there a failureto act, when...PRESIDENT:Oh, he might...EHRLICHMAN:Everything is disapproved? PRESIDENT:Yes, but that is Dean's problem, but...EHRLICHMAN:Well, the suspenders.PRESIDENT: Huh? EHRLICHMAN:A guy says, I was thinking about goingout...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:and plugging a hole in your tire, but Idecided not to.PRESIDENT:Yeah the point is, I think you've got a verygood point here. You say, "Well, look, whatin the wor1d is this? If; if the damn thing was disapproved why does Haldeman get blamedfor not disapproving it?"EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. They need two disapprovals in orderto make it stick?PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Well, I don't know, uh, enough about it Iguess. Uh, I'd sure like to see us came out sometime, and, uh, I suppose it has to be ata time that Magruder makes his deal.PRESIDENT:Well, let me say, I'll uh I've got Petersenon a short leash.EHRLICHMAN:Okay.PRESIDENT:Petersen or Dean. Keep that statement,about -and get this factual thing that John has worked up for you. You get that.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 4:02 P.M.10ZIEGLER:I've had, I had that typed.PRESIDENT:Fine. Because we've got to be ready to go onthat instantly. (Unintelligible) today. We (tape noise) will survive it. I don't think it's very...EHRLICHMAN:Not very appropriate news this morning.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). They will get back to itMonday night (unintelligible). I just think (unintelligib1e) their staff.ZIEGLER:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:It's obvious they will question him on this. EHRLICHMAN:That's what matters though. (Tape noise)PRESIDENT:The thing with the Ervin Committee (tape noise)EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. A statement of rules, and thenegotiations...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Uh--they adopted an awful lot of my stuff.Their rule on television is a very odd one. And it says "All still and motion picturephotography must be discontinued before thewitness commences his testimony. Television, however, may continue under the standing rules of the committee during-1he testimony of the witness."PRESIDENT:So it must that means what? It's live?EHRLICHMAN:That's my, that' s my interpretation. Well, no.Tape would be motion picture.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Why not? ZIEGLER:That's electronic. See, the terminology isstills, motion picture or electronic.EHRLICHMAN:That isn't the way they used it, and so I've gota call in for Baker to try and get a clarification.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Because it may be their intent that if thenetworks will go live, then let em go, but ifthey tape, then they can't tape the testimony.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 4:02 P.M.11(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:And, if that's the interpretation, I think weought to go for it.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:Don't you?ZIEGLER:At ten o'clock in the morning? Well, you know,just...(tape noise)EHRLICHMAN:If they run it at ten in the morning. Anyway,I'll get an interpretation and I'll be back toyou on it for instructions. Well, the, thereisn't much point in me going through the wholething until...(tape noise)PRESIDENT:I think the Ervin Committee, who(unintelligible) a break in this(unintelligible). Do you believe it would beat all helpful to be forthcoming with Ervinthen?ZIEGLER:Well as we mentioned before, I think you have,caution the Ervin Committee (unintelligible).Depends upon decisions. Whatever it isdecided to check with (unintelligible) or it may be to our advantage to analyze...EHRLICHMAN:Well, my problem's Howard Baker goes to Russiatomorrow, so there's got to be action or hegoes Wednesday, see. There's got to be actiontomorrow. The Ervin Committee's meeting upthere now. Timmons thinks the thing they aremeeting about is that somebody has pulled the plug on Dash, that he was nearly disbarred inPhiladelphia and he&#8482;s come up with someunfortunate scandal something about He's beentaken by surprise again and he's very unhappyand he's convened the Committee. The thingprovides well, well, they're kind of cuteabout this too. You can have a hearing inExecutive Session. Yeah, the Committee rulesat the witnesses' request for the purpose of determining scope, and in effect, as well thatwhere, where the witness should and should nottestify.PRESIDENT:Oh, that&#8482;s good.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 4:02 P.M.12EHRLICHMAN:And that's good, I think. Then there's a lotof stuff in there about, uh, that, they doprevail in closing statements. Uh they, theywill, uh...PRESIDENT:What's your advice, John?EHRLICHMAN:Uh there's very little left to argue aboutexcept the television, and, uh, we could saywe interpret this to mean that unless thetelevision is live, there won't be any andthat's satisfactory to us.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Now we might get the jump on them that way.PRESIDENT:All right. Fine. EHRLICHMAN:And then, let them come back and say, "No,that isn't what we mean. We mean, uh, it canbe taped.&#64258; And then we&#8482;ll come back and say,"Well, that isn't satisfactory.&#64258; By that timethey're in recess.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:And the thing wou1d be hung up until they getback.PRESIDENT:Yeah. And the other thing we had to, youknow, before it comes from the ErvinCommittee. But I don't think before it comesto the Ervin Committee it's going to amount toa goddamned thing. (unintelligible)ZIEGLER:The overall...PRESIDENT:Yeah.ZIEGLER:...decision, but... PRESIDENT:Don't you think at the present time we oughtto be forthcoming here?ZIEGLER:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:What you say, Ron, is that we intend to availourselves fully of the ground rule thatpermits the use of executive session and thatundoubtedly the majority of the White Housewitnesses will be the subject of a request tothe Ervin Committee for an executive session.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 4:02 P.M.13PRESIDENT:That's right. Agree with that.EHRLICHMAN:Then, what we've done is gone to our highground.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:And let them pull us off. ZIEGLER:of course, what really, what really is theErvin Committee investigating?PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) (Tape noise) EHRLICHMAN:They it's probably moot. It's probablymoot, but what well, we can say is we feelwe can live with these ground rules.ZIEGLER:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:You know it's very well, it is obvious thatthe negotiations were very worthwhile. Uh,we think the Committee has come up with a fine set of ground rules that we can live with. Uh, we are going to ful1y cooperateand then, on the side, you can say, "Seethis executive session provision."PRESIDENT:Why don't we frankly, (coughs)(unintelligible) executive (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Maybe I ought to get them and have them foryou, so that you can talk to Rogers about them.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Later today you just might make yourdecision and go on that. We can settle the Ervin Committee.EHRLICHMAN:Well, then, I&#8482;ll have to get Baker's okay.PRESIDENT:Well, why?EHRLICHMAN:To, uh, make our announcement, because theway I have it set up with him, they get ameeting tomorrow before we make anyannouncement.PRESIDENT:Do you want to make an announcement tonight? EHRLICHMAN:No, I thought that's what you meant if, ifyou were gonna go with the, with the Ervinthing today.PRESIDENT:Oh. We'll make it tomorrow then.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 4:02 P.M.14EHRLICHMAN:Okay, well then I'll have a chance to talkto Baker tonight.PRESIDENT:Baker, Baker will be left. He won't be atthe meeting tomorrow.EHRLICHMAN:Yes, he will. He won't go. He doesn't gountil the next day. I misspoke.PRESIDENT:Fine. You'll make the announcementtomorrow.UNIDENTIFIED: That's good.PRESIDENT:Okay, Ron?ZIEGLER:Yeah, but... PRESIDENT:Gives me time to think about it, that's thepoint. Go ahead. What is it?ZIEGLER:Well, I think if we make the announcementtomorrow, we could tie it into something.PRESIDENT:Yeah. We have a general announcement. Wewant to (unintelligible) and with ChappieRose and those guys. Do they realize that I've got to make this general announcement before the Magruder thing comes up?EHRLICHMAN:Well, is he afraid the President will looklike he's interfering with the Grand Jury?ZIEGLER:No, it's a quote. He said he doubts therehas been not much contact with the AttorneyGeneral, the Assistant Attorney General he said the President (cough) being an investigator.(Tape noise)EHRLICHMAN:Well, bless his heart, those contacts are amatter of record.PRESIDENT:That's right. But, I don't agree with himon that point.EHRLICHMAN:That point&#8482;s moot, you know. That was thePresident's only recourse.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 4:02 P.M.15PRESIDENT:That was it. I wouldn't, I wouldn't worryabout that (unintelligible) public life.See, he's thinking as a lawyer. The publiclikes to see the President, uh, gettin' at this goddamned thing.ZIEGLER:No, I agree with that.EHRLICHMAN:Chappie Rose doesn't like it when he saidManson was guilty here, but it doesn't convict him.ZIEGLER:Well, I'm not arguing. You see, I can'targue that point.EHRLICHMAN:I understand I'm just passing that point toyou. (Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:What would your, be your view about thiskind of a statement? You don't want it tonight do you?EHRLICHMAN:I don't want it tonight, but I'd sure liketo see you go full dress on it tomorrow. You see, Wednesday is the energy message.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, we're going to be sort ofsaturating the press Wednesday with that.PRESIDENT:Will they write and use it?EHRLICHMAN:I don&#8482;t know. I mean we're having briefingsand all that baloney. And so, uh, possibly, uh, it would be best to go either tomorrow or Thursday with this and I prefer tomorrow.PRESIDENT:We'll see how they get along with theirnegotiations. I suppose they're...(Tape noise)EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) they're hard-nosing thesenegotiations. Dean doesn't real1y give them all that much. Let me look at that piece of paper you've got there and then he said,"Well, gee, did Hunt go out of the country?No. Well, what else is there?&#64258; "Well, he says, (unintelligible)."APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 3:27 TO 4:02 P.M.16PRESIDENT:Dean isn't corroborating with Magruder inany way?EHRLICHMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:That's what it looks like.EHRLICHMAN:But can't they get that out of the way? Youknow?PRESIDENT:That area doesn't concern me.EHRLICHMAN:Well, let's think about that. If you werethe prosecutors, what the hell do you care? You know, if you were Glanzer or somebodysitting over there, Glazer or whatever it isPRESIDENT:And White House threatened, the President... EHRLICHMAN:What, what, what, what is, is it that he cansay? You stop and figure.PRESIDENT:That he's informed the President and thePresident didn't act? He can't say that, can he? I don't think, I've been asking forhis goddamned report, you know.EHRLICHMAN:The fact that he put the chronology alltogether he comes up with a hell of a lot of egg on his face, I think.PRESIDENT:I think he blames he would blame you andHaldeman.EHRLICHMAN:Well, he's going to have a little troublewith that.PRESIDENT:Is he? Good - EHRLICHMAN:I, I put together my log today. And I haveseen him on the average of five times amonth since the Watergate break-in. See,(tape noise) Bruce Kehrli finds that (unintelligible).
