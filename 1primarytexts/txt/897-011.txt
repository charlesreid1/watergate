HALDEMAN IN THE OVALOFFICE ON APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 12:00 TO 12:31PMTRANSCRIPT OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND H.R.HALDEMAN IN THE OVAL OFFICE ON APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 12:00 TO12:31 PM.PRESIDENT:Do you have any further thoughts on, uh,how, we stage this damn thing in the first stages?HALDEMAN:Ron's got it all worked out. We've goneover itPRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...and then he's got the, the views of thisAdvisory Group and, uh...PRESIDENT:What does this amount to, Bob? What's hissuggestion? (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Well, the problem is, you got to, you gotto...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) You can't help that. HALDEMAN:When you have, you, you can't leave that outbecause you get into the variables of whatyou do if you do it, before Magruder's story is out or after Magruder's story is out for example. Uh, he, uh, he feels that, they'llfeel, I guess, that...PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:That's right, you got to establish yourposition and, and what you&#8482;ve done and thatthe scenario will...PRESIDENT:Yeah, but you don't do a backgrounder. HALDEMAN:It works out pretty well on that. Thatyou've got Peterson running it, it-The idealtime to do it is when you break the case. I mean it's to-APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM2HALDEMAN:get Petersen over here. You run yourbackground, tell your story, and you know,so I got into this, and this is what I'mdoing. Or Ziegler does or however you do it. I guess you will do it. And, uh, thenyou say it and this has led us, uh as uh, wefully suspected it would, to, uh, uh, the next major step that, that, uh, that Gerald, Mr.-Petersen here will, uh, describe whichis, is the status of the case today. Andthen Petersen says, "We've, we've uh, as the President has reviewed these steps, and, uh,I can tell you today that we have broken thecase and, uh, that Jeb Magruder, uh, one of the principal figures in this, has given us a full report on exactly what did transpire.It, uh, clearly establishes by his owntestimony his own guilt as a high official of the Re-Election Committee...PRESIDENT:Makes charges against others.HALDEMAN:and provides charges against others which weare pursuing with the same diligence that we have, uh have up to now, and, uh, I will notdiscuss the others. I don't want to getinto that and will report to you periodically whenever, whenever, as developments take place. But this isfollowing up proper processes. We're notgoing to jeopardize the, this, he could make it, this, I am not going to may anything,and no, nothing should be said, that willjeopardize the rights of the defendants, but I also am not going to say anything...APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM3PRESIDENT:but that's to prose--HALDEMAN:...that will jeopardize our prosecutionbecause we are moving on people and we iregoing to get &#8218;em.(Pause)HALDEMAN:Ron will mention to you that, and Stevechatted with me, LenGarment, as uh, you would expect, followed, uh, your orders to steep himself in the Watergate. He hassteeped himself in the Watergate and he...PRESIDENT:Must report. HALDEMAN:...has now said it is imperative that hemeet with you for at least five minutes,preferably prior to two o'clock today, to report to you. And what he will say to you is that it is clear to him that you are inpossession of knowledge that, uh, you cannotbe in possession of without acting on. And that your action has to include cutting cleanly and that you've got to remove me,and probably Ehrlichman, although he has aninteresting thesis, according to Ron, I have not talked to Len, which is at least worthconsidering, which is that, that I moveahead of the game for now, and put out my whole story, including the factual details without-APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM4HALDEMAN:pulling any punches of my, you know, that$350,000 fund.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:That yes, I sent it... PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...back to the Committee...PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:and, but I go into specifics. That Iunderstand that Mr. Strachan delivered it toMr. LaRue and that uh, that, uh, it waywell, it was not done for that, my motive was not to provide funds for the defendants.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:My motive was to move these funds back wherethey belongedPRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:But I, I have to agree that, that, uh, Ifully recognized that, that LaRue's motive in accepting the money was, uh, as I had been told at least, a need for funds for thedefendants, uh, to provide legal feesPRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...and to provide support for theirfamilies, which I-and I acted at all timeson the, uh, uh at the instigation of and through John Dean. In other words I was not, I didn't do any of this.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM5HALDEMAN:John Dean came to me and said "We needthis," and I knew I wanted to get rid ofmoney, and I said "this is the way to do it"and so on. And, uh, I must say that John Dean, the President's Counsel, through whomI was working and who was my only contact inthis matter, at no time advised me that I was involved in doing anything that was illegal or improper, and I would assume andhave, would act on the assumption that Deangot away with it.PRESIDENT:I would...HALDEMAN:Now look.PRESIDENT:...I wouldn't I don't want to get into theposition of...HALDEMAN:Hanging someone else?PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:Well, but he is going to have hung himselfat that point in time.PRESIDENT:Which the point is, the question is whetherhe, whether he should then, can get, getoff, and get on other things. You know what I mean? I don't want him--he is inpossession of knowledge about things thathappened before this.HALDEMAN:Okay. PRESIDENT:But until this (unintelligible)...HALDEMAN:Len makes a...PRESIDENT:Security...APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM6HALDEMAN:Len makes a rather interesting case which isthat we've got to look at this in terms ofthe President and the Presidency.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:Which is what we all say about it.PRESIDENT:I'll see him about it.HALDEMAN:That's what we all say. PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMANUh, that, uh.PRESIDENT:Does De-, Does he known what I have alreadydone?HALDEMAN:No, I don't know.PRESIDENT:Petersen and all the rest?HALDEMAN:I don't know. That's, Ehrlicbman and, andZieg1er feel you shouldn't see him and that Ron should just assure him that you have al1these facts and that you are moving and thatwhat-he wants done is in the process of being done, uh...PRESIDENT:Why don't you call him in and tell him andtell him that now--HALDEMAN:Uh, I don't think I should but, John, uh PRESIDENT:No.HALDEMAN:I don't...APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM7PRESIDENT:I see your point, because he is asking foryou to be fired.HALDEMAN:Now his, the, well, he's asking, he's, he'ssuggesting a route.PRESIDENT:That he, uhHALDEMAN:He makes the case that it&#8482;s a better routefor me, in the long haul, and it&#8482;s a better route for the Presidency.PRESIDENT:But you'd be the first one to go out?HALDEMAN:Yeah. And, Id go out and I resign and Iresign and tell my story...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...publicly.PRESIDENT:Uh huh, right. HALDEMAN:Not to the press, I mean, not to the jury. PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:Do it publicly.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:In some fashion, and,-th, uh I tell thewhole story, all the details. And I say itis, I am absolutely clear in my own mindthat I have done nothing legally or morally wrong but that'll be up to the Grand Jury todetermine uh, uh. As...APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM8PRESIDENT:When's his ar--HALDEMAN:Then his argument is that I am in a positionthat, that, uh, he thinks that I can bringsomething like-that off. He feels that Ehrlichman should not try to do it 'cause hedoesn&#8482;t think he can bring it off, and hethinks, therefore, you've got to, got to put up a, up and try to hold Ehrlichman in, if you get a problem then you just got to lethim go. But at that point you're uh, it isa pretty rough spot...PRESIDENT:You mean Ehrlich-Yeah, we just won't knowwhat the situation is on Ehrlichman, onwhether...HALDEMAN:No. And there are other, there are morepotentials there than there are on mine.Mine I think we have all out, I think weknow them all and, uh...PRESIDENT:Ehrlichman's we just don&#8482;t know, there maybe more potentials. I think this, uh, is,uh, 'cause I think Dean is more on, uh,frankly giving Ehrlichman a screwing more than anybody else. I have that feeling, uh,he's got...HALDEMAN:Well, and if Col- PRESIDENT:He's got to get...APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM9HALDEMAN:...if Colson gets hung up anywhere, he'llgo...PRESIDENT:Correct.HALDEMAN:...on Ehrlichman and not on me. He can&#8482;tget me, I didn't work with him on any ofthat stuff. John did.PRESIDENT:Well, what would this be, Bob? This would bebefore I said anything?HALDEMAN:I don't think so, uh, I, I, should, I don'tknow. This, Ron just raised just this lastminute. He wasn't even gonna raise it, then, then, then he said, "Well, you mightas well know what, how Len spins it out.&#64258;Uh...PRESIDENT:What the hell information has Len got that Idon't, uh...HALDEMAN:None.PRESIDENT:I mean, uh... HALDEMAN:None. PRESIDENT:Uh, is he just basing this on minutiae,this, that or the other thing?HALDEMAN:He doesn't have anything you don&#8482;t have. PRESIDENT:Just tell him...HALDEMAN:All he has, he does, he, he says--I, I, thatit isn't a question of the legal thing. And he said, "I think...PRESIDENT:Fairness.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM10HALDEMAN:quite likely that Bob could get through thewhole legal thing," but then look at it dawnthe road, you, you got to go through allthese trials and everything. They, are going to get back into it again there--PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:They are going to get into the money andwhere the money went. If we haven't told them ahead of time, they are going to dragit out...PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:...of us drop by drop.PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:And, uh, I can see it's a weak appearingcase in terms of, uh, you know...PRESIDENT:Um, huh.HALDEMAN:...whether I think I was giving the moneyback to them or, where did the money go? Now I, I, there's no question about that. I, I knew where the money was gonna go, some ofit. I don't think all of it did.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:But I knew where some A it was gonna go and,uh, but you, you...PRESIDENT:But you've got to concede... HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) what in the hell...APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM11PRESIDENT:Again when LaRue testifies as to what the,uh, money was for~ was it to shut them up,or was it their purpose to provide help forthem, now...HALDEMAN:See, that's the other point. In myviewpoint it wasn't to shut them up, it'sthat, but that...PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:...is a hard case,for anybody to believe, Isuppose.PRESIDENT:Well, that's what you're gonna say to themabout it,HALDEMAN:Well, abso1utely.PRESIDENT:I see. HALDEMAN:But, but that, uh, so they can't make thelegal case, so, so, uh,PRESIDENT:Ron's said that on purpose, on--does Ronlike this scenario of your going out?HALDEMAN:No. No. He is opposed to it. He thinksits, it's wrong, but he says you know I'mbiased so, uh, that's that's a judgment ca1lthat I probably shouldn't even try to make. But he said I'm right.(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Rogers, Rogers, uh, I'll, I will see himthis afternoon.HALDEMAN:I haven't raised that with Rogers.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM12PRESIDENT:RogersHALDEMAN:All I said to Rogers...PRESIDENT:...has not said that either you orEhrlichman should leave, has he?HALDEMAN:But he doesn't know the facts.PRESIDENT:Well&#352;(pause) could you, you know really, sothat...HALDEMAN:Want me to meet with him and fill, and tryto fill in the facts?PRESIDENT:I really do, you, as to what the points ofvu1nerability are, and you can do it just cold turkey. Say I just wanted him to knowthis cause I haven't made notes(unintelligible) I have just made a few. And I won't, I want him to know the cold turkey--and I say that is what I want totalk to him about. Could you do that? Andpoint out it&#8482;s my view, I feel this, this is uh, legal. I mean it's a God damned arguable case, but it's just the fact youget splashed. Would you mind doing that?HALDEMAN:Sure. PRESIDENT:Have him come over, too. I shou1d say about3:30.HALDEMAN:3:30. PRESIDENT:and I will see him at 4:00. That would bevery helpful if you would fill him in onthis level, I...APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM13PRESIDENT:The, um, I could just say, so that Lendoesn't think that I, the, uh...HALDEMAN:You don't want him to...PRESIDENT:I just don't want him to come and tell methe obvious. That's the point. CouldEhrlichman just let Len know that the eventshave overtaken or is that dangerous? No, we better tell him.HALDEMAN:But he knows pretty much, I think.PRESIDENT:He knows about Magruder and all the rest?HALDEMAN:I don't know that he knows it in specificterms. I think he knows about, yeah, he hascome up with the same information that, thatJohn did and anybody would--looking into the picture.(Pause)PRESIDENT:Well, the, I've, I, I think I could(unintelligible) everything that Len's telling meHALDEMAN:Oh, yeah.PRESIDENT:It's the idea, hel1, we ta1ked about this aweek ago.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:You know where to protect-APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM14HALDEMAN:Yeah, talked about it for a long time.PRESIDENT:How you handle it.HALDEMAN:Going back to San Clemente I made the pitchfor my going out ahead.PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:But, but not going into as much detail.There, if I, if I do it now with what they've got, I if I do anything I've got, I've got to do everything. I think, that'sRon's point and I think he's right on that.PRESIDENT:Yeah. What does Ron think you ought to do,did he say, leaving out the PR. Does hethink we should try to tell the truth? I, Iam-gonna ask Rogers that, frankly.HALDEMAN:I'm not sure. I don't know. PRESIDENT:Believe me, I think, I think Ron wouldsay...HALDEMAN:Whatever you think he does, I think he'llsay just wait and see.PRESIDENT:Wait and see, huh?HALDEMAN:See his point is, there&#8482;s no question that Iwill be tarnished.PRESIDENT:That's right. The question is whether youruseability, basically...APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM15HALDEMAN:And you have to evaluate that at, at thatpoint...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...and it seems to me at that point you havethe option of my saying to you that I haveconcluded and now, I'll say that now andthat I haven't, but I, I will sure say it--that I concluded that, that, uh, I'm, I am tarnished to the point where I, I can'tbe useful.PRESIDENT:Right. Your right, your usefulness has beenimpaired and, therefore, you can't be usefulanymore, right, that's the way you put it.HALDEMAN:Sure. Then I go out and Garment's statementis that then I go out and, and, uh, and hit some of this, use the position that I haveestablished that way from the outside to,uh...PRESIDENT:To fight? HALDEMAN:Yeah, somehow or other. I don't exactlyknow how. I think he spells that out butRon didn't get into it yet. And a...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Who, who was it that says,who, who Len, John Ehrlichman on the--Ithink I should see Ron.HALDEMAN:No. Ron and John Ehrlichman talked aboutthat.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:I was up so late last night.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Go ahead.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM16PRESIDENT:Ron and John Ehrlichman do not think Ishould bother seeing--On what grounds?HALDEMAN:Ron felt you had to see him jus forinternal, but you know that's so...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...concerned about things that, that youalmost have to see him just to keep ah...PRESIDENT:Yeah, why don't I see him after I seeRogers? How would that be?HALDEMAN:You could do that.PRESIDENT:In other words I'll, I'll have a p1an inmind. I'm gonna get some thoughts in mymind. I am not gonna trouble.HALDEMAN:See, Ziegler's been, apparently Zieg1er'sbeen meeting with this group of men, Chappie Rose and Moore and they have been running ona different strain.PRESIDENT:Could you ask Ziegler to have Len put it ona piece of paper before I meet him?HALDEMAN:Sure, I'll ask him.PRESIDENT:That wou1d be helpful.HALDEMAN:Sure. PRESIDENT:Tell him I need it before, uh, tell him I ammeeting with Rogers at 4 o'clock and wouldjust like his recommendation on a piece of paper before that. Then I'll see matters better. How does that sound to you?APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM17PRESIDENT:Let me say that I think we can move theRogers thing up or down.HALDEMAN:Can you move him up to three?PRESIDENT:Well, wait a minute. One-thirty p.m. I&#8482;vegot to get some rest this afternoon.HALDEMAN:Yeah. Still leave by four--get ready(unintelligib1e). You may know something by then.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Good.PRESIDENT:Have you filled Henry in, Bob? HALDEMAN:Nope.PRESIDENT:You haven't? Well, he's got enough problemsin Laos.HALDEMAN:I haven't. But somebody else may. He seemsto, he seems to be on his own. Well,Garment took it upon himself to go meet withHenry and to meet with Al Haig, uh, to discuss his concern about the whole situation, apparently.PRESIDENT:Well, what the hell did he do that for?HALDEMAN:On the basis that, he, he thought there wasa real danger and threat to the Presidencyand that, that, and, uh...PRESIDENT:Maybe I don't want a memo from him first.What do you think? Maybe he just better do it orally.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM18HALDEMAN:Well, John felt he should have written toyou. That that is what he should have doneat the beginning. That, uh, maybe you havea problem with that. That means the secretaries got to write it up.PRESIDENT:Yep, yep. Well just say that, uh, tell himthat I am meeting with Rogers this afternoon. Now, I, I think somebody should say that. Who has he put the requestthrough to, John or through you, or, uh...HALDEMAN:He just sent it up through Steve Bull. He,Ron knew he was. He is working with Ronnow, rather than John.PRESIDENT:Hmph, okay.(Pause)HALDEMAN:I just, you know, it is, uh, impossible,That is why I hope Rogers can stay cool andsort of above it. It is impossible for any of us--PRESIDENT:All the concerned people.HALDEMAN:If we get a, uh, a feel. I just have a, a,a horrib1e feeling that we may...PRESIDENT:Reacting like Dean?HALDEMAN:Just, yeah. That, that, we are just wayoverdramatizing it, you know. I...PRESIDENT:That's my view.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM19HALDEMAN:Think, that you know, that's, that's...PRESIDENT:That's what I want to believe.HALDEMAN:Well, that is what I was gonna say, that&#8482;sself-serving too, so it&#8482;s, uh...PRESIDENT:Well, you, you can, as you know, of course,uh, that, that would be the tendency. Thatis the trouble with Garment. I wanted him to get into this on the legal side. I didn't mean anything and I, I, I must say Ireally didn't get acquainted with the case,but, I meant I really didn't get acquainted with the problems for the day, period, andall that, because Len, Bob., always reactsto things. Am I, an I right that we have got to do something to...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...restore the credibility of thePresidency.HALDEMAN:Yeah, of course, you know the credibilitygap in the old days. Ah...PRESIDENT:Well, there's: there's going to be...HALDEMAN:Len hit the panic button, tell 'um. PRESIDENT:Uh, yeah, that's...HALDEMAN:If we reacted in Garment's way in otherthings, we wouldn't be where we are.PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM20HALDEMAN:That doesn't mean he isn't right this time,incidentally.PRESIDENT:I know. It would be very helpfu1 to me ifyou could see Rogers over at, uh. I would get him at 3 o'clock, give him an hour onthe whole God damned thing. I wonder if youand John shouldn't see him together? Would that be alright?HALDEMAN:I'd like to...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...if, if that's okay with Bill. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Will you ask him?HALDEMAN:I'll ask him.PRESIDENT:Say because, uh, so you... HALDEMAN:...to give him a full run before he meetswith you.PRESIDENT:Obviously because, he is, he has made astudy that, uh, and we want him to come in. And tell (unintelligible) very glad if he could meet with just you or meet with two, Iprefer he meet with the two of you and thenhe meets, uh, in my office around 4 o'clock.HALDEMAN:Ehrlichman makes a strong case that on thismy making a statement and my making astatement or anything, that as of now that my potential...PRESIDENT:Guilt?HALDEMAN:Uh, well, not guilt...PRESIDENT:(Uninte11igible)APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM21HALDEMAN:But that I should not do anythinguntil--without my lawyers.PRESIDENT:That's my (unintelligible). I think, Idon't think you should say a thing.HALDEMAN:And that, uh, I'm afraid my lawyers aregoing to tell me for Christ&#8482;s sake(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I think the time, the time has outrun thatbecause Petersen has told me that you andEhrlichman are going to be called to theGrand Jury soon. He has told me that. Under the circumstances, I could not adviseyou with, with my, uh, limited knowledge ofthe law. I could not advise anybody to make a statement. You know what I mean?HALDEMAN:Check.PRESIDENT:Because, basically, when you get in therethey are going to question you on your damn statement.HALDEMAN:Of course, for my dough, that's alright.PRESIDENT:I know.HALDEMAN:I really, I, whatever I say in the statementis exactly what I say in the Grand Jury.So, uh...PRESIDENT:I know. HALDEMAN:But, nevertheless. PRESIDENT:I wouldn't give them that opportunity, I'd,uh, keep that.HALDEMAN:I think Len's view is that what you need isa bold move, you know, a really, some kindof a dramatic move. Henry feels that, butHenry feels that you ought to, you should go on television.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM l2:00 TO 12:31 PM22PRESIDENT:I knowHALDEMAN:He still thinks that...PRESIDENT:9:00 o'clock.HALDEMAN:...which is his solution to any problem,and...PRESIDENT:Do you believe I should do the 9:00 o'clock?HALDEMAN:No, sir. On this? PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:I don't either.HALDEMAN:We are all steeped in this, but look at thenewspaper. Where is the Watergate today?PRESIDENT:Well in the country, it is not that big.It, it is just a little bit in the evening news and it should be handled as a news story. I, I am not going to go on and say"Look, we, we in a hell of a shape.&#64258; Itwill be a big story, Bob, for a couple or three weeks. Let's face it...HALDEMAN:Yep, that's right.PRESIDENT:But it is not going to be it, and it won't,won&#8482;t, uh, have one hell of a time, and uh.(Unintelligible with noise)
