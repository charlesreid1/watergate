HALDEMAN AND JOHNEHRLICHMAN, THE OVAL OFFICE APRIL 16, 1973, AT10:50 A.M. TO 11:04 A.M.(Noise)HALDEMAN:The scenario works out pretty well. Yeah(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Well, John, let me fill you in quite brieflyhere, Uh, when we, uh, first talked to him I said, uh, we talked about the work you didbefore this began, I said I would suggest thatI wanted (unintelligible). I said, "Have youtold anybody about it?&#64258; He said, "No, and Idon't intend to.&#64258; He said, "I don't intend tosay a thing more than I need to say inanswering questions with regard to this, matter, and I will not comment on anythingelse. Of course, I will not comment on anyconversation I have ever had with thePresident, and so forth and so on.&#64258; So as faras he is concerned, that operation will not bediscussed. Of course, the problem I supposeis as far as others are concerned or wereinvolved. But if they do, John, I would playit straight out. God damn it, of course we do this.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I have been thinking about this a littlebit. If I ever got a question like that atthe Grand Jury...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...I would have to step out, ask the U.S.Attorney to step out, and tell him that under executive priviledge, since it is a nationalsecurity matter...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...I can't answer; that I would be happy torefer it, uh, to the President...PRESIDENT:Fine.EHRLICHMAN:...for his decision as to whether I shouldanswer that...PRESIDENT:Sure. EHRLICHMAN:...or not, but that I am in no position torespond to it.APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:50 TO 11:04 A.M.2PRESIDENT:If you are asked, you are to say that.EHRLICHMAN:And then...PRESIDENT: (Uninte1ligible)EHRLICHMAN:...if he says, "Why, well then we will haveto go talk to the Judge," I&#8482;ll say, "I thinkthat is what we should do."PRESIDENT:Fine. And then you get to the Judge and yousay this involved--uh...EHRLICHMAN:...a highly sensitive national security...PRESIDENT:Highly sensitive national securityinvestigations involving leaks. Would you say that?EHRLICHMAN:No. I-, I wouldn't, wouldn&#8482;t tell themwhat...PRESIDENT:Nation-, national security information. EHRLICHMAN:And I'm just not at liberty,...PRESIDENT:That's right. That's right.EHRLICHMAN:...and, uh, the procedure we have ingovernment for a thing like this, is for the witness, uh, who is put a question like thatto refer it to the President for hispersonal review.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And I would like an opportunity for that to,be done.PRESIDENT:I can see you being asked the question. EHRLICHMAN:I think, think, that's right...PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:...but that is the process that I think Iwould have to follow.APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:50 TO 11:04 A.M.3PRESIDENT:I, uh, I just, I told him I would like tohave that and he said, "What about Haldeman and Ehrlichman?&#64258; I said "Well they, theyboth really told me that they will resign,uh, you know what I-mean, in case--and I said, and I'm sure nothing, nobody&#8482;s goingto resign around here untilsomebody&#8482;s--until I get further information, until I, uh, satisfy myself with Petersen, and so forth and so forth and, uh, so on.And, uh, he said, "Well" he said, "do youmind if I take the letters that I prepared?&#64258; I told him I'd discreetly consider it. "Iwould like to prepare them so in the event Ihave to go to trial this won&#8482;t prejudice me in any, you know, in that.&#64258; I said, "Fine, fine.&#64258; I said, "Pre-, prepare me what youthink your, your 1etter of resignationshould be.&#64258; So there it is. So he is thinking in both terms, apparent1y. I, I am just guessing, and I think that's altogetherproper, that he should have a litter of thatsort of thing. But I told him, as I said, "Look, as-far as Haldeman was concerned latelast night, there is no question aboutresigning around here.&#64258; I said, "I've got their resignations in hand anytime I want them.&#64258; But; what do you think? Wasn't thatthe proper thing to say to him?EHRLICHMAN:That's fine. HALDEMAN:He.doesn't give you any indication how he isgoing to p1ead, or what, what his re...?PRESIDENT;No, I, I said-when are you gonna t--, uh go--He said well my lawyers would, uh, would work that out. But he also-get this again,John---that, that his lawyers think thatthe, that his uh, possible criminal liability is limited, you know, and I thinkthat's damn hard to prove. Now maybe hesaid basically, and, and I, and I see what, what is involved here, as he was sort of conduit basically, whatever that means, but,I said (unintelligible) he says it is thesame, he didn't use the word conduit,APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:50 TO 11:04 A.M.4PRESIDENT:CONT:but he said it is tangential in both cases.He said, "It's a God damn hard case"--and hesaid what he and what his lawyers tell him that the Justice Department could well comeout of this without bringing in anyindictments against anybody on the White House staff. And I said, "What about Colson?&#64258; And on that he said, "Well, thereare three areas, and again, I don&#8482;t recallwhich ones where he"s involved. He mentioned Bittman, the call (unintelligible)and so forth.EHRLICHMAN:Call to Magruder. PRESIDENT:Call to Magruder? Oh, yeah, that. Butthat"s previous.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah.PRESIDENT:I, I hit him hard and I said, "Now lookhere, John. I asked you for a report and you said nobody was involved. Was thattrue?&#64258; And he said, "Yes.&#64258; I said, "Do youstill believe that?&#64258; He said, "Yes.&#64258; As far as anybody on the White House staff,nobody had any pre-knowledge. He said yeah,the vulnerability is in terms of the after effect. As for the legal side of this, I think he's got us some sharp lawyers, John,they think this is a God damn hard case toprove.EHRLICHMAN:For the, for the government to prove?PRESIDENT:Yes sir, a very hard case to prove.HALDEMAN:Government thinks so, too, don't they? PRESIDENT:Yeah. I told you that, that, that&#352;Petersendidn't think they...HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:...uh, he said that the legal thing is justterribly difficult. He said...APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:50 TO 11:04 A.M.5HALDEMAN:It is a moral question and, uh,impression...PRESIDENT:Yes, Petersen's thinking it&#8482;s basically,let's face it, a PR and it's not my job not his.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENTAnd I&#8482;m--So, ah, so I told him. We have todecide this and, decide this and, try to look at (unintelligible), and so forth. ButI, at least, uh, felt, a little better aboutthat than I did last night.EHRLICHMAN:Apparently.PRESIDENT:Well, now, when do I see Rogers? Uh...HALDEMAN:Anytime you want, He&#8482;s on standby. I talkedto him.PRESIDENT:How about four o'clock? Get him over here.HALDEMAN:That's fine. Whatever you want.PRESIDENT:Well, I will just call him and tell him tobe on standby this afternoon. It may be earlier. Well, no, it's just as well. Havehim, have him over here at four o&#8482;clock.HALDEMAN:Four o'clock. PRESIDENT: E.O.B.EHRLICHMAN:He's helping us to find counsel.PRESIDENT:Good, good. (Uninteiligible) how does thescenario work out may I ask? Is there something that you...HALDEMAN:We1l, it works out very good. We had that,that, oh, you became aware sometime ago that this thing did, did not parse out the way itwas supposed to and that there were somediscrepancies between what you had been told by Dean in the report that there was nobody in the White House involved, which may stillbe true.APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:50 TO 11:04 A.M.6PRESIDENT:Let me say that, I don&#8482;t want to...I don'tthink it, it is gaining us anything bypissing on the Dean Report as such.EHRLICHMAN:No. PRESIDENT:What I mean is I would say that I was notsatisfied that the Dean Report was, wascomplete, uh, and I also, I felt that I ought to, I ought to go--it was my obligation to go beyond that to people otherthan the White House.EHRLICHMAN:Well, Ran has an interesting point.Remember you had John Dean go to CampDavid...PRESIDENT:I know... EHRLICHMAN:...and write it up, and he came down andsaid, "I can&#8482;t.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:That's the tip off and right then youstarted to move.PRESIDENT:That's right. He said he could not, couldnot write it.HALDEMAN:Then you realized there was, there was moreto this...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...then you had been led to believe.(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Then how do I get credit for gettingMagruder to the stand?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I, uh, it is very simple. You tookDean off the case right then--two weeksago...PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:...the end of March.(Unintelligible)APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:50 TO 11:04 A.M.7EHRLICHMAN:The end of March. Remember that letter yousigned to me?PRESIDENT:Uh, huh.EHRLICHMAN:30th of March. PRESIDENT:I signed it to you? Yes.EHRLICHMAN:Yes sir, and it says, "Dean&#8482;s off of it. Iwant you to get into it. Find out what the facts are. Be prepared to--"PRESIDENT:Why did I take Dean off? Because he...EHRLICHMAN:Because he was involved.PRESIDENT:...he became involved: I did it, really,because he was involved with Gray.EHRLICHMAN:Well there was a lot of stuff breaking inthe papers, but at the same time...HALDEMAN:The scenario is that he told you he couldn'twrite a report so obviously you had to takehim off.PRESIDENT:Right, right. EHRLICHMAN:...and so then we started digging into itand we went to San Clemente. While I wasout there I talked to a lot of people on thephone, I talked to several witnesses in person, kept feeding information to you...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...and as soon, and as you saw that the,that dimensions of this thing from the reports you were getting from the staff--whowere digging into it--Moore, me, Garment andothers.HALDEMAN:You brought' Let Garment in?PRESIDENT:Len Garment, yeah.EHRLICHMAN:You began to move.APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:50 TO 11:04 A.M.8PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:You began to move.PRESIDENT:I want the dates of all those...EHRLICHMAN:I've, I've got those. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Go ahead, right, and then--EHRLICHMAN:And then, uh, uh, it, it culminated lastweek...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...in your decision that Mitchell should bebrought down here; Magruder should bebrought in; Strachan should be brought in.PRESIDENT:Shall I say that we brought them all in?EHRLICHMAN:I don&#8482;t think you can. -I don't think youcan.HALDEMAN:I wouldn't name them by name. Just say Ibrought a group of people in.EHRLICHMAN:...have witnesses personally come to theWhite House.PRESIDENT:I will not, I will not tell you why becauseI don't want to prejudice their rightsbefore the, before the, uh,(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Exactly. But I heard enough that, that Iwas satisified that it was, it was time toprecipitously move. I called the Attorney General over, in turn, uh, Petersen..."PRESIDENT:Well, uh, the Attorney General, actually,you made the call to him on Saturday.EHRLICHMAN:Yes. PRESIDENT:...after you. But this was after you heardabout the Magruder strategy.EHRLICHMAN:No, before. PRESIDENT:Oh.APRIL 16, 1973, FROM 10:50 TO 11:04 A.M.9EHRLICHMAN:We didn't hear about that until about threeo'clock that afternoon.PRESIDENT:Why didn't you do it before? This is verygood now, how does that happen?EHRLICHMAN:Well--PRESIDENT:How do you n-- Why wasn't he called in then?John, you had made a report.EHRLICHMAN:Well... SEVERAL(Unintelligible)VOICES:HALDEMAN:John&#8482;s report came out of the same place theMitchell, the Magruder-report didPRESIDENT:No, my point is...(unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:I called him to tell him that I had thisinformation.PRESIDENT:Good. But, why was that? That was becausewe had heard Magruder was gonna talk?EHRLICHMAN:No. We did it...Oh, I will have to check,I'll have to check my notes again.HALDEMAN:We didn"t know whether Magruder was going totalk.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. HALDEMAN:Magruder was still agonizing on what he wasgoing to do.PRESIDENT:Well on Dean --but you remember you came inand said you've got to tell him about it politely.EHRLICHMAN:Well, now-let&#8482;s see.PRESIDENT:(Unintilligib1e) HALDEMAN:I&#8482;ll tell you the reason for the hurry inthe timing was that we learned that Hunt wasgonna testify on Monday afternoon.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.
