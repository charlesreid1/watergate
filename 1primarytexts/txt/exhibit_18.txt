HALDEMAN AND JOHN EHRLICHMAN IN THE EXECUTIVEOFFICE BUILDING, APRIL 14,1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.[Part I]PRESIDENT:Jack, uh, do, uh, did you reach anyconclusions as to, uh, where we are, recommendations?EHRLICHMAN:No, no conclusions.PRESIDENT:Uh -- problems? EHRLICHMAN:Dick Wilson, I think, is -- has aninteresting column this morning.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:Ah, yeah, it's, uh, uh, (noise) moneyproblem. He's been analyzing this moneyproblem (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:Oh, yeah, last night. PRESIDENT:Wilson is in the Star.EHRLICHMAN:Well then it is twice he made this point.PRESIDENT:So what? EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible). Argues that really the,the essence of this whole thing is too muchmoney, too easily spent, and so on. And then he, uh...(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:That's his great underlying, uh --PRESIDENT:Yeah. That's what everybody -- that's what--HALDEMAN:No, not everybody. That's a, uh, one par -...PRESIDENT:Well , Reston lies. HALDEMAN:...one group thesis...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...that, uh, Reston...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...Reston has on that side and point out(tape noise). And, the, the you know, his he, he, he carries it beyond -- he sayssolving Watergate doesn't take care of it,but, uh, then there's, uh, all the money in --PRESIDENT:Dick wants the President to speak out on thewhole general issue of money and campaign and that sort of --EHRLICHMAN:Basically that's -- generally, but he, hegets specific on this. He says also(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Is that what you think, go out and make aspeech?EHRLICHMAN:No, I'll tell you what I think. I thinkthat the President's personal involvement in this is important. And I don't...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...I don't think it's a speech. PRESIDENT:Well, that's the point. I think it's --there're other ways you can get at it. Now,I was thinking of the, uh -- before we getinto that though, let's get back -- that's something we can get into later -- I'd liketo get - I'd like to go in, if I could, towhat your conversation with Colson was and, uh, in essence. What, what was yours, what did he and the lawyer come to tell youabout?HALDEMAN:Hunt's visit. EHRLICHMAN:That visit was to tell me that Hunt wasgoing to testify on Monday afternoon.PRESIDENT:How does he know that? HALDEMAN:Um hmm. PRESIDENT:How does, how does he get such information?EHRLICHMAN:Uh, undoubtedly through Bittman.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Or Bittman through Shapiro.PRESIDENT:Now why, why is Hunt testifying? Did hesay? Or, uh, what...EHRLICHMAN:He didn't say. PRESIDENT:...(unintelligible) about the -- EHRLICHMAN:He said -- I'll tell you what he said andthen I'll tell you what I think the fact is-- he said Hunt was testifying because there was no longer any point in being silent.That, uh, uh, so many other people weretestifying that there was no -- he wasn't really keeping any secrets.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Couldn't add much. Uh, my, my feeling isthat Bittman got very antsy when this grand jury started focusing on the aftermath...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) know what was involvedHALDEMAN:That's it exactly. EHRLICHMAN:...and that he went to the U.S. Attorneyand he said, "Maybe I can persuade my clientto talk."PRESIDENT:What does, uh, what do Colson, et al, Colsonand Shapiro think we ought to do under these circumstances? Get busy and nail Wilsonand, uh, nail Mitchell in a hurry? Is thatwhat he means?EHRLICHMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:How is that going to help?EHRLICHMAN:Well, they feel that... PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I just want to get the besteffort.EHRLICHMAN:...they feel that after Hunt testifies thatthe whole thing's going to fall in, in short order.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:That Mitchell and, uh, Magruder willinvoluntarily be, uh, uh, indicted.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) say...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...that you have lost any possibly ofinitiative, so - for participation...PRESIDENT:So, what does Colson... EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:...want us to do?EHRLICHMAN:He wants you to do several things. He wantsyou to persuade Liddy to talk.PRESIDENT:Me?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. That's his - I didn't bring mynotes, but basically -PRESIDENT:Oh. Last night you didn't mention this, butthat's alright.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, I thought I had.PRESIDENT:Maybe you did, maybe you did. EHRLICHMAN:I didn't, I didn't...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:...in any event, he didn't - PRESIDENT:I would bring, he-, le-, let Liddy in andtell him to talk?EHRLICHMAN:You can't bring him in. He's in jail. But,uh -PRESIDENT:Oh. EHRLICHMAN:You would send, you'd send word to him, andof course wanting him to make fulldisclosure or in some way you would be activist on this score.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:There's no, there's -- that isn't -- doesn'tinvolve any real problem. As Dean points out, uh, Liddy is not talking 'cause hethinks he's supposed not to talk. If he issupposed to talk, he will. All he needs is a signal, if you want to turn Liddy up.PRESIDENT:Yeah, oh -- yeah. But the point that...HALDEMAN:Face it, he believes -- PRESIDENT:...Colson wants is a public signal. Is thatright?HALDEMAN:No, he (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:A public signal (unintelligible) what thehell do you do?EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) he wants to be able to --he wants you to be able to, to say afterwardthat you cracked the case.PRESIDENT:Go ahead. What else? EHRLICHMAN:Well, I forget what else. Do you remember,Bob? Uh, uh --HALDEMAN:Well, that was basically (unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:Basically, basically, uh, he, he feels thatthe next forty-eight hours are the, are thelast chance...PRESIDENT:Mmm-huh. EHRLICHMAN:...for the White House to get out in frontof this and that once Hunt goes on, thenthat's the ball game.PRESIDENT:But you've got to be out in front earlier. EHRLICHMAN:Well --PRESIDENT:But, I mean/sorry, not earlier, butpublicly.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, either PRESIDENT:Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:...either publicly or with provable,identifiable steps which can be referred to later as having been the proximate cause.PRESIDENT:He's just not talking because he thinks thePresident doesn't want him to talk? Is that the point?EHRLICHMAN:He's -- according to them...PRESIDENT:(Noise)...Mitchell...(Noise) Mitchell'sgiven him a promise of a pardon (tape noise) Bittman?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, uh, no, according to, uh, uh, Colsonand Shapiro. And I don't know where they get that.PRESIDENT:Mitchell has promised Liddy a pardon?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. Other points that Colson may nothave mentioned, uh, uh, -- (tape noise)PRESIDENT:I have an uneasy feeling that, that Magruderstory may have been planted.HALDEMAN:No. PRESIDENT:Or is it true?HALDEMAN:There, there's a third Magruder phone callwhich I haven't heard that, uh, uh, says...PRESIDENT:Says he did talk to the press?HALDEMAN:...says he did talk to a reporter on Monday-- did not say any of the things he's, he's reported to have said, that what he, that -- he said it wasn't an important conversation.He said the same -- he gave the reporter thesame line.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:That, you know -- but in listening toMagruder's thing...PRESIDENT:Alright. HALDEMAN:...I was convinced he wasn't completelytelling the truth that he -- in what he wassaying. As you get into it, I'm convinced that his (unintelligible) that part was pretty much...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...(unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Uh, but you come to this -- all these piecesmust be put together now. But you come toMagruder, uh, where the hell does Colson get such a thing? Uh, or is Colson a liar or --EHRLICHMAN:Shapiro, Shapiro says he has a very goodpress contact who has proved very reliableto him and he says his, his practice in this town depends on his knowing what's going on.And he's (unintelligible) press contact.This is one of the -- and he's always found it to be --PRESIDENT:He says that he's talked to Magruder andMagruder said that, that -- ?HALDEMAN:Yeah. What they've now told us is we'llnever get the transcript. That he --PRESIDENT:Magruder, think Magruder may have done this?EHRLICHMAN:I think Magruder may have talked, talked tosomebody in the press and that, that was...SEVERALVOICES:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:But, but in the great detail that Colsonwent into that he nailed Bob Haldeman, I mean the way Colson did, he says he, he hadColson in the tube...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...but, but not in any way that wasparticularly, ah, bad. Right?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think, I think like so many thingsthis got, this got planted as a little seed by Shapiro with Colson and that it grew and,uh, uh, uh --PRESIDENT:Oh yeah? EHRLICHMAN:Uh-huh. I'd, I'd just -- HALDEMAN:I would guess what's happened is he's gotthis report from -- Colson does -- fromDanny Hofgren that at the bar in the Bahamas with (unintelligible) or something (tape noise) one night said to Hofgren, "Jesus,everybody was involved in this." He didn'tuse the --PRESIDENT:Uh hmm.EHRLICHMAN:Everybody knew about it.HALDEMAN:Mitchell, Haldeman, Colson, Dean, thePresident --PRESIDENT:Magruder...HALDEMAN:He, he specifically said the President.PRESIDENT:...Magruder doesn't believe that, though,does he?HALDEMAN:No. Ya know, I've got it, I've got...SEVERALVOICES:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I just wonder if he believes it. I'mcurious because -- do you think he believesit, John?EHRLICHMAN:No. This tape's very convincing and Higbyhandled it so well that Magruder has closedall those doors now, with this tape.PRESIDENT:What good will that do, John?(Tape noise)EHRLICHMAN:Uh, sir, it beats the socks off him if heever gets off the reservation.PRESIDENT:Can you use the tape?EHRLICHMAN:Well, no. You can use Higby.HALDEMAN:Why can't you use the tape? PRESIDENT:Well -- EHRLICHMAN:It's an illegal tape.HALDEMAN:No, it's not.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. HALDEMAN:It is not.PRESIDENT:That you tell somebody --HALDEMAN:No, sir. EHRLICHMAN:No beeper on it. HALDEMAN:There is no beeper required. You check theWashington law.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:District of Columbia is under federal lawand the federal law does not requiredisclosure to the other party of therecording of phone conversations. The phone call was made to Magruder's lawyer's officewhich is also in the District of Columbia soboth ends of the conversation were in the District of Columbia and there is no law requiring disclosure.EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's interesting.HALDEMAN:It's perfectly legal. PRESIDENT:Well, anyway, anyway --HALDEMAN:It can (or may) not be admissible, but it'slegal.PRESIDENT:That's interesting. That's a new one.(Unintelligible) beep every, every whilethen, now and then. I thought it was.However, I never heard anybody beepin', andhell--didn't you?HALDEMAN:No. It all depends on where you are. Some-- the basic law in most States is that youmust disclose to the other party that you'rerecording the conversation.PRESIDENT:Yeah. What is the situation -- I might --I'll get past this in a hurry -- what is thesituation, John, in your opinion on what was Colson's and/or Shapiro's motive in building up the Magruder story? Maybe they believeit.EHRLICHMAN:Their, their innuendo is that, that Mitchellhas put Magruder up to this.PRESIDENT:I guess not. Okay. There's the motive.Now, let me come to something else.HALDEMAN:I don't believe that Magruder's -- PRESIDENT:I don't either. Not at all.HALDEMAN:I don't believe Mitchell has tried to --PRESIDENT:Huh? HALDEMAN:I don't believe Mitchell tried to Magruder'sfaith 'cause he refers to Mitchell and nowthat I have decided to talk I am going totell Mr. Mitchell and he's gonna be very unhappy with me 'cause he's told me not to.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) tape, uhHALDEMAN:I did PRESIDENT:And he's an emotional fellow who's ready tocrack.EHRLICHMAN:I, I really, I have no doubt that he's readyto talk.PRESIDENT:What is he -- he hasn't been subpoenaed yet,has he?EHRLICHMAN:Well, he won't be. But he's already beenthere.SEVERALVOICES:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Dean doesn't think they'll give him a, achance back unless he comes running at themand just and, uh, spills it.HALDEMAN:'Cause (A) they don't call the suspects and(B) they don't recall perjury witnesses.PRESIDENT:Right. What would you do if you were hislawyer? Wouldn't you advise him to go inand try and purge himself, at least -- getrid of one charge, doesn't he?EHRLICHMAN:I'm not sure he's rid of it, but itcertainly reduces it when he comes involuntarily.PRESIDENT:The way I understand it under the law, John,if he were to come to the...EHRLICHMAN:But he's hooked.PRESIDENT:...Grand Jury. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, but he's hooked, see. There'scontrary evidence already...PRESIDENT:Oh, I see. EHRLICHMAN:...before the Grand Jury. PRESIDENT:In other words --EHRLICHMAN:If he did that --PRESIDENT:Strachan -- Strachan got in before there was(unintelligible) evidence.EHRLICHMAN:Exactly.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Strachan? HALDEMAN:No, (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...Magruder. EHRLICHMAN:And, and you take the circumstances, now... PRESIDENT:They better have...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. If it's known, if it's known, forinstance, that Hunt is going to come in and testify, then Magruder comes rushing in andsays I want to tell all, it's, uh, you know--PRESIDENT:Magruder's stuck on both counts. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, but I think he could improve it. Ithink he, he really could help to purgehimself.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). I've come to the -- may Icome to the other things that, uh, that you, uh, you talked to Colson about, uh? Huntgoing to talk -- what is Hunt going to say?Do we have any idea?EHRLICHMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:He says, for example, will he say thatColson promised him clemency?EHRLICHMAN:No. Apparently not. PRESIDENT:And, uh, you see the, the only, the onlypossible involvement Of the President inthis is that. Now apparently, John, either you or Bob or Dean, somebody told me theysaid Cols-, told Colson not to discuss itwith me.EHRLICHMAN:I did. PRESIDENT:You did. How did, bar-, how did it get toyou then, John? How did you know that the,the matter had to be discussed with Bittman or something like that?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I...PRESIDENT:When did this happen?EHRLICHMAN:I had... PRESIDENT:I remember a conversation this day, it wasabout five thirty or six o'clock, thatColson only dropped it in sort of parenthetically. He said, "I had a little problem today," -- and we were talking aboutthe defendants-- and I said, I sought toreassure him, you know, and so forth. And I said, "Well, that's" -- told me about Hunt'swife -- he said, "It's a terrible thing,"and I said, "Obviously we'll do just, we will take that into consideration." And that was the total of the conversation.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I had, uh, we had had a couple ofconversations in my office --PRESIDENT:With Colson?EHRLICHMAN:With, or, I had with Colson. Yeah.PRESIDENT:Well, how was...EHRLICHMAN:And I, uh --PRESIDENT:...who was getting, Who was, was Bittmangetting to Colson? Was that the point? Who, who --EHRLICHMAN:Now Hunt, Hunt had written to Colson.PRESIDENT:Oh? EHRLICHMAN:Hunt wrote Colson a very I've-been-abandonedkind of letter.PRESIDENT:Yeah. When was this, John? EHRLICHMAN:I am sorry, I -- PRESIDENT:After the election?EHRLICHMAN:Oh, yes. Yeah.PRESIDENT:Oh, and Chuck Colson -- you knew about thisletter?EHRLICHMAN:Colson come in to tell me about it. And hesaid, "What shall I do?" And I said, "Well, uh, better talk to him, I think somebody 'd better talk to him -- the guy is obviouslyvery distraught..."PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:"...and, uh, feeling abandoned." PRESIDENT:Right. Good advice.EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, he said, "Well, what can, what canI tell him about, uh, clemency or pardon? n And I said, "You can't tell him anythingabout clemency or a pardon." And I said,"Under no circumstances should this ever be raised with the President."PRESIDENT:Yeah. Told him not to raise it with me.Well, he raised it, I must say, in atangential way. Now he denies that, as I understand it, that he said that he'd be outby Christmas. He says --EHRLICHMAN:I never, I've never talked to Chuck aboutthat, have you.HALDEMAN(?)Yes and no.PRESIDENT:What did he say he said?Well, I'll tell you what I, what Dean, orsomebody tells me he said he said. He saidthat he didn't -- he just talked to, saw, saw Bittman casually, or on the phone or something of that sort.EHRLICHMAN:Bittman?PRESIDENT:That was it. EHRLICHMAN:Oh.PRESIDENT:And he said to Bittman...EHRLICHMAN:Oh. PRESIDENT:...he said, "I," he said, "I... EHRLICHMAN:Well, now thatPRESIDENT:...he said, "I...EHRLICHMAN:...a difference. PRESIDENT:Listen, I have written it. He said, "I, uh,I, uh, I, I know that, uh, I know aboutHunt's concern about clemency. I, Chuck Colson, feel terrible about it, 'cause I knew his wife." And, uh, he said, "I will,will go to bat for him and I have reason tobelieve that my views would be, ah, listened to." Well it's the last part, part that, uh, might in any way remain, although...EHRLICHMAN:He says he talked to Bittman and that he wasvery skillful...PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:...in avoiding any commitment. He saysBittman...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:...Bittman was pitching 'em, but that hewasn't catching 'em. And...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:...he either has a tape of that meeting or atape of the conversation or some such thing.HALDEMAN:That's where he lost his thread, then. Yes,said you and Dean told him you, two promised clemency, and that he was smarter than youand, and didn't.PRESIDENT:You haven't said you and Dean promised?HALDEMAN:That Ehrlichman and Dean told him topromise...PRESIDENT:Shit. HALDEMAN:...(unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Well, anyway, whatever the case might be,uh, let me ask a question...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) a little strange. PRESIDENT:...does, does Hunt -- well, just so that he,uh -- does he, does, does, does he indicatethat they, that Hue, Hunt's going to talk to that subject for example -- the promise of clemency?EHRLICHMAN:Uh, he didn't say that. He didn't say that.I didn't ask him.HALDEMAN:Well, going back to the basis, John -- as Irecall, they don't have anything to indi- --we don't know how they know Hunt's going to testify. We assume that Bittman told them...EHRLICHMAN:Right.HALDEMAN:...(A). (B) we don't, they don't have anyindication, based on their knowledge that Hunt's going to testify, of what Hunt isgoing to testify to, except on the basis ofShapiro's meeting with Hunt...EHRLICHMAN:The other day.HALDEMAN:...the other day. And they're assuming thatwhat Hunt told Shapiro is what he will tell the Grand Jury, but I don't know why they'd have any reason to assume that.EHRLICHMAN:I don't, uh, uh, -- Shapiro's generalcomment was that Hunt would corroborate a lot of McCord's hearsay...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...but that it also would be hearsay. PRESIDENT:Alright. Hunt, however, and this is whereColson comes in, right? Hard. Hunt couldtestify on Colson's pressure.HALDEMAN:Yeah. But what they, what they've said he'sgonna test-...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...on the coverup, what he is gonnatestify...PRESIDENT:Now wait a minute... HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...I'm talking about something entirelydifferent...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:...you're talking about when ColsonHALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:...Colson and Liddy were in the office andColson, Colson picked up the phone andcalled Magruder.HALDEMAN:That's right. Sure. PRESIDENT:Now, there, uh, now Colson says that, uh,that they didn't discuss bugging at thatpoint. Hunt could say, "I went in and I showed this whole plan to Colson and Colson phoned -- picked up the phone...EHRLICHMAN(?):That's right.PRESIDENT:...and talked to Magruder." EHRLICHMAN(?):True. PRESIDENT:...does, does, does, does Colson realize hisvulnerability there?EHRLICHMAN:Well, course Colson claims he has novulnerability, because when Hunt and Liddycome in to talk to him they talked in verygeneral terms.PRESIDENT:I understand that. EHRLICHMAN:So, he...PRESIDENT:I--EHRLICHMAN:...doesn't acknowledge PRESIDENT:I--EHRLICHMAN:...he doesn't acknowledge that there's anypossibility --PRESIDENT:I, I understand that, but I'm just simplysaying, it's...EHRLICHMAN:I think he's right.PRESIDENT:...that Hunt and Liddy could...EHRLICHMAN:That's true. PRESIDENT:...could, could, could charge that -- that'sthe point. They, they, they -- if theytalk, I would assume they would get intothat point with them, any, any cross- examiner.EHRLICHMAN:I, I've asked Colson specifically about thatconversation and he maintains that they were talking, uh, in general terms about intelligence and when they said intelligencehe meant one thing and apparently they meantanother.PRESIDENT:Question, uh, for example, uh, is, is Huntpreparing to talk on other activities thathe engaged in?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I couldn't, I couldn't derive that... PRESIDENT:Umhmm.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) at all.PRESIDENT:For the White House and for the -- you know? EHRLICHMAN:I, I couldn't, I couldn't get that at all. PRESIDENT:The U.S. Attorney, I would assume, wouldnot be pressing (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Ordinarily not. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Now, McCord, McCord volunteered this HankGreenspun thing, gratuitously apparently, not, not --PRESIDENT:Could, can you tell me, is that a seriousthing? Did, did they really try to get intoHank Greenspun'sEHRLICHMAN:I guess they actually got in.PRESIDENT:What in the name of Christ, though, doesHank Greenspun got with -- anything to do with Mitchell or anybody else?EHRLICHMAN:Nothing. Well, now, Mitchell --PRESIDENT:Hughes?EHRLICHMAN:Here's -- yeah, Hughes. And these twofellows, Colson and Shapiro, uh, uh --Colson threw that out.PRESIDENT:Hughes on whom? EHRLICHMANWell, you know the Hughes thing is cut intotwo factions...PRESIDENT:I don't -- EHRLICHMAN:(A) and then the...PRESIDENT:Uh, fighting --EHRLICHMAN:...and then the other, and they're fighting. PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Bennett, Senator Bennett's son, for whomHunt worked...PRESIDENT:Oh? EHRLICHMAN:...represents one of those factions.PRESIDENT:Yeah. So he ordered the bugging?EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:...I know the...SEVERALVOICES:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:...it's a bag job. HALDEMAN:They busted his safe to get something out ofit.EHRLICHMAN:Now -- HALDEMAN:Wasn't that it? They flew out, broke hissafe, got something out...EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:...got on the airplane and flew away. EHRLICHMAN:Now, as they sat there in my office...PRESIDENT:There're others...EHRLICHMAN:What? PRESIDENT:...other delicate things, too. You've got,apart from my poor damn dumb brother, whichunfortunately or fortunately was a long time ago, but, uh, more recently, you've gotHerbert Humphrey's son works for him, and,of course, they're, they're tied in withO'Brien, I suppose. But maybe they were trying to get it for that reason.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know why. The, the two of them puton a little charade for me in the office...PRESIDENT:Shapiro and Colson? EHRLICHMAN:...as we -- yeah -- as we talked about this,and it may have been genuine and it may not.But...PRESIDENT:But they didn't know anything about it? EHRLICHMAN:...but they -- no -- they said, one said tothe other, "Say, that may have something todo with the New York Grand Jury," meaning the Vesco Grand Jury which is a runaway andwhich is into --PRESIDENT:You think Colson knew about that? EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. I don't say he knew about it.I said, he says he doesn't know even whoHank Greenspun is.PRESIDENT:He should. Everybody knows he's the editor.His son, for Christ's sakes --EHRLICHMAN:I, I'll take him at face value on that one,uh, uh, it isn't any other evidence.PRESIDENT:You didn't know that either? EHRLICHMAN:I, I know very well who he is.PRESIDENT:Alright. Uh, let me just take a minutefurther and run out the Hunt thing, and then the Grand Jury. I just want to get all the pieces in my mind...EHRLICHMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:...if I can. EHRLICHMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:Uh, Hunt's testimony on pay-off, of course,would be very important.EHRLICHMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:Is he prepared to testify on that?EHRLICHMAN:I think so, that's what they say, that hewill, and that he will implicate O'Brien andParkinson. And, uh, then, of course, ah --PRESIDENT:O'Brien and Parkinson?EHRLICHMAN:The lawyers. PRESIDENT:Were they the ones that talked to Hunt? EHRLICHMAN:Well, he says they were and that they handedhim the money. He in turn handed it to hiswife and she was the, uh, go-between for the...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...Cubans. PRESIDENT:For what purpose? That's the key to it all. EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think, uh, he'll, he'll hook, hang'em up on obstruction of justice.PRESIDENT:Can Hunt do that? HALDEMAN:How can he do that? Why would he simply --why doesn't he accomplish his purpose simplyby saying they gave the money to handle their legal fees?EHRLICHMAN:They're -- all hang out there apparently.PRESIDENT:Now this is...HALDEMAN:I don't think -- PRESIDENT:...this, this is what Colson tells you guys? HALDEMAN:That's right. I don't...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:...have any other information on this. PRESIDENT:That, Hunt, that Hunt then is going to go.Well, now that, that, that raises the, theproblem on, -- with regard to Kalmbach. He has possible vulnerability as to whether he was aware, in other words, the motive, themotive --EHRLICHMAN:This doesn't add anything to the Kalmbachproblem at all.PRESIDENT:What happened...EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:...what happened on that? EHRLICHMAN:Dean called Kalmbach.PRESIDENT:And what did Dean call Kalmbach about?EHRLICHMAN:And he said we have to raise some money inconnection with the, the, uh, uh, aftermath, and I don't know how he described it to Herb. Uh, Herb said how much do you need,and, uh...PRESIDENT:It was never discussed then? EHRLICHMAN:...presumably Dean told him and Herb went toa couple of donors and got some money andsent it back.HALDEMAN:Dean says very flatly that Kalmbach did notknow the purpose, uh, for the money and hasno problem.PRESIDENT:Dean does know the purpose... UNIDENITIFIED:Right.PRESIDENT:...however. Hunt testifies -- so, sobasically then Hunt will testify that it was so-called hush money. Right?EHRLICHMAN:I think so. Now that again, my water can'trise any higher than source.PRESIDENT:I understand. EHRLICHMAN:But that's that... PRESIDENT:What is your, what is your...EHRLICHMAN:...that's, that --PRESIDENT:What does that serve him, let me ask, justto try to, uh...EHRLICHMAN:Gen-...PRESIDENT:...I mean, would it serve him? EHRLICHMAN:The only thing it serves him is to, uh,uh...PRESIDENT:Would it reduce his sentence?EHRLICHMAN:...have his sentence remitted, that's all. HALDEMAN:He'd be serving the same purpose by notsaying it was hush money -- by, by saying hegave it to "these guys that I had recruited for this job and I..."PRESIDENT:I know.HALDEMAN:"...felt badly about their family and," youknow, "a great deal about it."P. RESIDENT:That's right, that's what it ought to be andthat's got to be the story that, uh, and that...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...that will be the defense of, uh, thepeople, right?EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) the only defense they haveand so forth.HALDEMAN:But that... PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:...that was the line that he had used aroundhere.PRESIDENT:What? HALDEMAN:That was the line that they used aroundhere. That we've got to have money fortheir legal fees and family sup-...PRESIDENT:Support them. Well, I heard something aboutthat at a much later time.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And, frankly, not knowing much aboutobstruction of justice, I thought it was perfectly proper.EHRLICHMAN:Well, it's like the...PRESIDENT:Would it be perfectly proper? EHRLICHMAN:...the defense of the...PRESIDENT:Berrigans?EHRLICHMAN:...the, uh, Chicago Seven. PRESIDENT:The Chicago Seven? HALDEMAN:They had a defense fund for everybody.PRESIDENT:Not only a defense fund, Christ, they, theytake care of the living expenses, too...UNIDENTIFIED:Was there any --PRESIDENT:...despite what all this crap about justlegal fees, they take care of themselves. They raise -- you remember the Scottsboro case? Christ. The, uh, uh, the Communistfront raised a million dollars for theScottsboro people. Nine hundred thousandwent into the pockets of the Scotts-, er, uh, Communists.HALDEMAN:(Laughs).PRESIDENT:...so it's common practice.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Nevertheless, that's Hunt then saying aboutthe payoff. Alright -- Hunt, on otheractivities: uh, Hunt then according to Colson was not, uh --(tape noise) get into. What Colson meant about the door of the OvalOffice.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, I'll have to get back to you on that,'cause Shapiro was there and I didn't wantto get into it.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:He --HALDEMAN:No, but it wasn't, it was in connection --PRESIDENT:No, not -- it was in an earlierconversation...HALDEMAN:Your instructions said --PRESIDENT:...about the Magruder conversation...HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...when Colson was, uh -- I think on theMagruder conversation, from what I haveseen...EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:...it seems to me that --EHRLICHMAN:...'cause Magruder doesn't got to the doorof the Oval Office. He doesn't even come to visit me...PRESIDENT:I know that.EHRLICHMAN:...in the White House. PRESIDENT:But he, he -- it is Colson's, it is Colson'sview that Magruder's talking would have theeffect of bringing it there because of the -- I think what he's really referring to,John, is that by reason of Colson, uh, byreason of Magruder nailing Haldeman and, er, and Colson, that that's the door to the Oval Office. I don't know what else because...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...there's nobody else around, nobodyphysically around.HALDEMAN:Magruder isn't going to nail Haldeman.PRESIDENT:Well, let's see. I don't think so either,but --HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Well that is, that tape is, is invaluable,is it not?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, I suggest to Bob that he keep it.HALDEMAN:And I disregard that as (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:(Laughs) PRESIDENT:Let me just say a couple of things that wehave to get there. We, we, uh...HALDEMAN:Well, when we come to that, we'd take(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...in regard to your, regard to your, uh,uh, your, your views and so forth and so on,now, uh I was told the other day, uh, lastnight, John, you and Bob or somebody -- I guess you and I were talking about, uh,somebody going to see Mitchell. And yousuggested Rogers. Got any other better names? Why did you...EHRLICHMAN:Well, I've been up and down the list, and uh--PRESIDENT:...why did you suggest Rogers? EHRLICHMAN:Well, I suggested Rogers because --PRESIDENT:First let me tell you -- purpose of mission-- tell me what it is, now.EHRLICHMAN:The purpose of the mission is to go andbring him to a focus on this and I'd say,"The jig is up. And the President stronglyfeels that the only way that this thing can end up being even a little net plus for theAdministration and for the Presidency andpreserve some thread is for you to go inand, and, uh voluntarily, uh, make a statement."PRESIDENT:A statement that Haldeman, uh, has prepared.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, uh, a, a sta-, statement that basicallysays...HALDEMAN:No. He's got to go beyond that.EHRLICHMAN:"I am, I am both morally and legallyresponsible."PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Now, the reason for Rogers is that he'sclean, number one...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...uh, he has been both, uh, AttorneyGeneral and has this other investigatory...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...and Senatorial background and so forth.And there isn't anybody that Mitchelltrusts, except Haldeman.PRESIDENT:He hates Rogers. EHRLICHMAN:I understand. HALDEMAN:Doesn't, doesn't trust Rogers but he wouldknow if Rogers came...EHRLICHMAN:That it was... HALDEMAN:that it was you.EHRLICHMAN:Now, the other, the only other alternative,going up and down the list --HALDEMAN:Also, it from a public viewpoint Rogers isthe dean of the Cabinet...PRE SIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and is the logical man as, n as anattorney, and former Attorney General.PRESIDENT:From a public viewpoint, that may be but,also...EHRLICHMAN:Fifty reasons not to do this. HALDEMAN:You've thought of those?PRESIDENT:Oh, yeah. Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:There, there, and ther, there haveconsistently been -- you go back through the history of this --PRESIDENT:I know, but now is the time to do something.I agree with you.EHRLICHMAN:Now is the only time, probably, and I'm, I'mpersuaded by that argument.PRESIDENT:Oh, I am too. I'm, I'm not, -- I'm notarguing about not doing it...EHRLICHMAN:I understand. PRESIDENT:I'm just trying to talk about the namesEHRLICHMAN:Okay. Uh, in, in going down the list, JohnAlexander is the only other one that I have come to that, that in any way could, couldbridge it. Garment can't do it.PRESIDENT:Now, let me give you another name... EHRLICHMAN:Alright. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) President.PRESIDENT:...let me give you another name. Ken Rush.(Unintelligible). He's a fine lawyer, utterly clean. Uh, a long-time friend of Mitchell's -- not a close friend, but he'sknown him, you know, in New York, uh, andthat grew up there, they are, they, you know, they sort of -- Rush would understandit all. Uh, Mitchell does not hate him --does trust him.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know how able Rush is. I'd, uh --he's got -- uh, I just don't know. Uh,another name -- uh, two other names thathave occurred to me that I'll throw out, uh, one is Eliot Richardson and the other is,uh, uh, Kleindienst. There is anotherpossibility and that's Henry Petersen. Well, that of course...PRESIDENT:Well --EHRLICHMAN:but he's in the prosecutorial end...PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:And so is Kleindienst.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's-the trouble.PRESIDENT:Kleindienst, Kleindienst revealing toMitchell the contents of the Grand Jury and all the rest...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...is wrong. EHRLICHMAN:I, I must say I am impressed with theargument that the President should bepersonally involved in it at this stage.PRESIDENT:Right. I agree. EHRLICHMAN:Uh, old John, uh, Dean had a, had aninteresting -- got a phone call from himabout 12:30.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Oh, no. I was working on something I'lltell you about here.PRESIDENT:What did you do? EHRLICHMAN:Uh, well, not much last night.PRESIDENT:You mean another subject?EHRLICHMAN:Oh, no. No, this -- HALDEMAN:There is no other subject. (Laughs) EHRLICHMAN:This week there's no other subject.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:That, uh, no, I'll tell you. Last nightwhen I got home I decided that, that, uh, Iwould sit down and try to put down on papera report to you about what I have been doing since you asked me to get into this.PRESIDENT:Right, right.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, I am concerned about the overall aspectof this and then -- I want to talk about that before we --PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know what your timing is like. PRESIDENT:No problem. EHRLICHMAN:We'll probably get back to it.PRESIDENT:Uh, got plenty of time.EHRLICHMAN:But, Dean called and he said, "Alright,here's a scenario." He said, "We've all been trying to figure out..."PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:"...how to make this go." He says, "ThePresident calls Mitchell into his office on Saturday. He says, 'John, you've got to dothis and here are the facts: bing, bing,bing, bing.' And then that's -- you pull this paper out here. And you'd better go do this. And Mitchell stonewalls you. Sothen, John says, 'I don't know why you'reasking me down here. You can't ask a man to do a thing like that. I need my lawyer.Uh, uh, I don't know what I'm facing? Hesays, 'You just really can't expect me to do this?' Uh, so the President says, 'Well, John, I have no alternative.' And with that,uh, uh, the President calls the U.S.Attorney and says, 'I, the President of the United States of America and leader of the free world want to go before the Grand Juryon Monday.'"PRESIDENT:I won't even comment on that. HALDEMAN:That's a silly (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:What I mean is, we're -- typical of thethinking of -- we're running out every, every line. So that was 12:30 this morning. I, uh, uh, but, but I...PRESIDENT:I go before the Grand Jury -- that's...EHRLICHMAN:...I - PRESIDENTThat's like putting Bob on nationaltelevision uh...HALDEMAN:With Dan Rather. PRESIDENT:What? HALDEMAN:With Dan Rather.PRESIDENT:...well, well by putting it on nationaltelevision period. When, uh, your, uh, when your, when your audience basically is notthat big.EHRLICHMAN:Well, let's, let's take it just as far asyou calling Mitchell into the Oval Office,as a, as a...(Tape noise)EHRLICHMAN:...essentially convinced that Mitchell waslinchpin in this thing...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...and that if he goes down, it can redoundto the administration's advantage. If hedoesn't then we're --PRESIDENT:How can it redound to our advantage? EHRLICHMAN:That...PRESIDENT:There's others - - -EHRLICHMAN:...That. You have a report from me based onthree weeks' work, that when you got it, youimmediately acted to call Mitchell in asthe, as the provable...PRESIDENT:I see. EHRLICHMAN:...wrong-doer...PRESIDENT:I see.EHRLICHMAN:...and you say, "My God, I've got a reporthere. And it's clear from this report that you are guilty as hell. Now, John, forChrist's sake go on in there and do what youshould. And let's get this thing cleared up and get it off the country's back and moveon." And, uh, uh --HALDEMAN:Well, plus the given side of it is thatthat's the only...PRESIDENT:Even way to --HALDEMAN:...way to beat 'er down.PRESIDENT:Well -- HALDEMAN:Now, from John Mitchell's own personalviewpoint that's the only salvation for JohnMitchell. Can you see another way? And, obviously, once you have it, you've -- he's got to admit it.PRESIDENT:He's, he's not gonna make it, anyway.HALDEMAN:Another factor in that to consider for whatit's worth, is the point Connally made to mein that conversation we had on this.PRESIDENT:I ought to talk to Mitchell? HALDEMAN:I don't know whether he said this to you ornot. He made the point that you had to getthis laid out and that the only way it couldhurt you is if it ultimately went to Mitchell. And that, that would be the oneman you couldn't afford to let get hung onthis.PRESIDENT:Even worse than Hughes talk. HALDEMAN:He thought so. Seemed to be...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) That's true. Yeah.HALDEMAN:...seemed to be, because he's the epitome ofyour...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...your hard line. PRESIDENT:I think he's wrong about that. I think thisis the worst one, well, due, due to thecloseness to the President at the time ofthe crime.HALDEMAN:But -- PRESIDENT:Would you agree, John?HALDEMAN:Well, what's bad --EHRLICHMAN:That's the way I see it. HALDEMAN:But, what Connally also said was unless it'sthe President himself who nails Mitchell,then the President is (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Can I pull up this into the larger, in alarger picture? We've gotta live day to daythrough these things...UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...and forget, uh, the, uh, perspective thatwill be put on this period...UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...three months later. PRESIDENT:The point is whether or not -- I think I'vegot the larger picture -- I think, I mean I,and I, in this regard, the point is thisthat the --we need some action before, uh --in other words, if, if it's like my, my feeling about having the Grand Jury do it and the court system do it rather than ErvinCommittee -- now we want the President to doit rather than the Grand Jury.EHRLICHMAN:No.PRESIDENT:And I agree with that.EHRLICHMANWell, you're doing it in aid of the GrandJury.PRESIDENT:No. No. I didn't mean it. I didn't meanrather than the Grand Jury, but I mean to,to, to, to worm the truth -- now look, I, I -- the Grand Jury doesn't drag him in, hegoes in as a result of the President'sasking him to go in.HALDEMAN:Okay. But while you're at that point couldI argue a contrary view for a minute?'Cause I don't agree with that.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:I strongly feel, thinking it through, withall the stuff we talked about last night,that you don't want to rush in and that thesolution here, if we can find it -- maybe it's impossible, is...PRESIDENT:Is for Mitchell to come voluntarily?HALDEMAN:Well, or for Magruder to come voluntarilyand nail Mitchell. But if the solution is - - I agree that some sort of --PRESIDENT:Where does Magruder come to? Me?HALDEMAN:No. The, the U.S. Attorney. That -- PRESIDENT:Well, why does -- why don't I urge Magruderto -- I mean let me, let me look at this.The urging of Liddy to testify, the urging of Magruder to testify and Mitchell. John run those by, by -- I didn't mean to stopyour...EHRLICHMAN:No, that's alright. PRESIDENT:...your whole analysis but I think, I thinkI know what you're, what, what, what --isn't that really the essence of it?EHRLICHMAN:I'm trying to write the news magazine storyfor next Monday...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...a week, Monday a week. And, if it isthat "Grand Jury Indicts Mitchell"...PRESIDENT:Right. . EHRLICHMAN:..."The White House main effort to cover up,uh, finally collapsed last week when theGrand Jury indicted John Mitchell and Jeb Magruder,"...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...and uh, "Cracking the case was the test)-many of a, a number of, uh, peripheral witnesses who -- each of whom contributed todeveloping a, a uh, cross-triangulation andpermitted the Grand Jury to analyze it," and so on and so forth. And then "the final, the final straw that broke the camel's backwas, uh, an investigator's discovery of thisand that and the other thing." That's one set of facts. Uh, uh, and then the- tag on that is "The White House Press Secretary RonZiegler said that the White House would haveno comment."PRESIDENT:I know, I know. It can't be done.EHRLICHMAN:The other one, the other one goes: "Eventsmoved swiftly last week, after the President was presented with a report indicating that, uh, uh -- for the first time -- that, uh, uhsuspicion of John Mitchell and, uh, JebMagruder as ring-leaders in the uh, Watergate break-in were in factsubstantiated by, uh, considerable evidence.Uh, the President then, uh, uh, dispatched so and so to do this and that and it"-- maybe to see Mitchell or, or something ofthat kind and, uh, uh --" these efforts, uh,resulted in Mitchell going to the U.S. Attorney's office on Monday morning at nineo'clock, uh, asking to, uh, testify beforethe Grand Jury. Uh, uh, charges of cover- up, uh, by the White House were, uh, uh,materially dispelled by the diligent effortsof the President and his aides in, uh,moving on evidence which came to their hands in the, in the closing days of the previous week." Ah --PRESIDENT:I, I'd buy that.EHRLICHMAN:Okay. PRESIDENT:You want to -- so, we get down to thetactics.EHRLICHMAN:Now, I've been concerned because since theend of March, I have turned up a fair amount of hearsay evidence that, that points atthis guy. Now, just take --PRESIDENT:And so did Dean... EHRLICHMAN:And, and so did John.PRESIDENT:...so did Dean.EHRLICHMAN:Now, taking this -- PRESIDENT:Yet we've tried, very honestly, we've triedto, tried to look at it the best way wecould. Maybe he couldn't, maybe he reallydidn't know.EHRLICHMAN:Well, it's hearsay. And so, he... PRESIDENT:That point.EHRLICHMAN:...don't hang a guy, you don't hang a guynecessarily --PRESIDENT:And also, we are going to remember, Mitchellhas denied it.EHRLICHMAN:But I was, I st-, stood over there in Bob'soffice and listened to that tape of one of the co-actors saying, flat out on the tape,that he-was guilty and that Mitchell wasgonna, was going to fall and all that and I said to...PRESIDENT:Did he say that? Did he say that?HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Well, we can't -- EHRLICHMAN:...and, and I said to myself, "My God! I'ma, you know, I mean, I'm a United Statescitizen. I'm standing here listening tothis, what is my duty?"PRESIDENT:Well the point is you've now told me.That's the problem.EHRLICHMAN:That's correct, that's correct. PRESIDENT:You see, the differ, uh, uh, the uh, theproblem of my position up to this time hasbeen, quite frankly, nobody ever told me a God-damn thing...EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:...that Mitchell was guilty. EHRLICHMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:I mean, uh --HALDEMAN:Well, we still don't know.PRESIDENTI, I... HALDEMAN:I don't...PRESIDENT:must say --HALDEMAN:I, I will still argue that I think thescenario that was spilled, uh, spin, spun out, that Dean spun out to Mitchell isbasically the right one.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:I, I will still argue that I think thescenario that was spilled, uh, spin, spunout, that Dean spun out to Mitchell isbasically the right one.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...I don't think Mitchell did order theWatergate bugging and I don't think he was specifically aware of the Watergate bugging at the time it was institutedPRESIDENT:Well, let me --HALDEMAN:I honestly don't. PRESIDENT:That may be. Now...HALDEMAN:I think that Mitchell...PRESIDENT:...here's what he told... HALDEMAN:...he had okayed that, but, uh,(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...for your, for your information here'swhat he told Rebozo. He knows very well.HALDEMAN:Mitchell? PRESIDENT:That's why I asked, does it have to be alawyer...HALDEMAN:Mmm.PRESIDENT:... to tell Mitchell. HALDEMAN:Jeez, I wouldn't get Bebe into this.PRESIDENT:I know.HALDEMAN:Boy! PRESIDENT:Well, anyway, let me tell you what he toldRebozo, uh, right afterwards -- no, no, er amonth ago --he said, he said -- you know(unintelligible) you know how he puffs on his pipe -- "In the ITT thing, I may haveperjured myself but I sure didn't on thisGod-damn thing."HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:There you are.HALDEMAN:Okay. I still think that technically thatmay be correct.EHRLICHMAN:I think so -- 'cause that's what he toldMoore. And he believes that.PRESIDENT:What did he say? Could he tell Moore?EHRLICHMAN:Well, remember, I, he, I asked Moore to findout what Mitchell had testified to.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's right. And Mooreheard the testimony and said well you're not --EHRLICHMAN:He, he was never asked the right questions.Now, uh, uh, as far as he's concerned...HALDEMAN:He probably didn't in the Grand Jury either. EHRLICHMAN:That's right. As far as the quality of theevidence is concerned --PRESIDENT:May I just, uh, digress for one point, thathas nothing to do with this except that you've got to fight what's going on damnsoon. It is essential that, uh, Roger'sdeparture be delayed until this is over.Now, the hell with Henry on this. The pointis, any member of the cabinet, exceptKleindienst, leaving during this -- there's no way that Dick is gonna leave anyway -- and, uh, now you gotta talk to Hen-, yougotta just "And Henry it's not appealable.'"You just gotta say that, Henry, there are bigger things here." With Rogers --EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Huh? EHRLICHMAN:There's just gonna leave -- PRESIDENT:You're just gonna say -- alright fine, thendrop that and just say Rogers is gonna stay'til this thing's over. Right John, you agree?EHRLICHMAN:Absolutely.PRESIDENT:Ya see, Rogers is gonna leave on the firstof June, and, uh, but, uh, uh, he must --EHRLICHMAN:We may be, we may be out of the woods by...PRESIDENT:May be...EHRLICHMAN:...it might be over by then. PRESIDENT:...out of the woods? No. HALDEMAN:I don't know.EHRLICHMAN:Well, uh, to go back to...PRESIDENT:Alright. We won't -- EHRLICHMAN:...the quality of the evidence --PRESIDENT:...I only mentioned Bebe because(unintelligible) let me -- let's get -- go ahead with your --EHRLICHMAN:Well, all I was going to say is that --PRESIDENT:Alright. I now have evidence, I amconvinced...EHRLICHMAN:But you, you don't have evidence if, uh, uh,if I --PRESIDENT:I'm not convinced he's guilty... EHRLICHMAN:That's it. PRESIDENT:...but I am convinced that he ought to gobefore a Grand Jury.EHRLICHMAN:Exactly. Uh, and, and, and it -- what I didlast night, or this morning, was to writeout what would, uh, would in effect be a report to you...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...of, of this, of this...PRESIDENT:Let me ask you wheter -- EHRLICHMAN:...(unintelligible) deliver it to you.PRESIDENT:John -- (pause) Go see Mitchell.HALDEMAN:(Laughs). EHRLICHMAN:Uh, all I know about my relationship withMitchell from his side is what others tellme. He has never, he's never, uh, never(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:The Mitchell problem, the Mitchell problemwith Rogers has been totally created.EHRLICHMAN:I see.(PRIVILEGED MATERIAL DELETED)**********[Part II](PRIVILEGED MATERIAL DELETED)PRESIDENT:...Let's come around, let's come aroundagain though. You know the case. You'veconducted the investigation for me. You have reported to me and I have asked you togo up and lay it on the ground to Mitchelland to tell Mitchell, look, there is only one thing that could save him. I think John's got to hear that kind of talk and Ithink he's got to hear it from somebody thatdoesn't have -- I was thinking of bringing Rogers in and telling him all this stuff,but God-damn it, Mitchell will wind himaround his finger.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah. PRESIDENT:...well, there's our problem.EHRLICHMAN:If you want me to go, I'll go.PRESIDENT:I think the message... EHRLICHMAN:I don't know what he thinks --PRESIDENT:...but the message to Garcia has got to becarried --EHRLICHMAN:Bob, Bob has a pretty good feel ofMitchell's attitude toward me that I don't have.PRESIDENT:Well, Mitchell's attitude toward you is notgoing to be personal -- it isn't going to be any better for Rogers. It would be towardRush...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, but how in the name of God can -- PRESIDENT:...Rush is smart and he is tough. He's agood man. And, uh, he's a man, incidentallythat we can consider --EHRLICHMAN:He can't argue the facts of this case,that's the point.PRESIDENT:The point is, Rush is a man that I wouldcons- -- if you need a special man in the White House -- I was thinking last night that he is the best man I can think of...EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...to bring over to advise the President onthis God-damn thing and -- no, and examine all the White House things, to look at allthe FBI files, to look at your report, Deanreport, the FBI files and give me a report. He's articulate, he's, he's, uh, beforetelevision he's, uh, respected among, uh --he's one of the towering figures in the Ambassadorial world and in the bar. He is, he's no slouch.EHRLICHMAN:Bobby?PRESIDENT:And an outsider's -- good God, it's going totake so long to -- Rush, I trust. Rush is afriend. He's a total White House man andyet he is not, not tied into this.EHRLICHMAN:He's exactly the kind of guy we need. Now,I don't know how he, he is in person -- hehasn't practiced law for a long time.That's not, that's not an immediate drawback but, but, uh...PRESIDENT:He has the lawyer's mind.EHRLICHMAN:...you got to get him somebody to help him,like, uh, uh --HALDEMAN:Haven't, though, haven't events overtakenthat project?PRESIDENT:Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Bob, forChrist's sake, will you -- look, the pointthat I make is let's suppose they get Mitchell. Then they're going to say nowwhat about Haldeman and what about Chapin,and what about Colson and the rest? I've got to have a report indicating -- in other words, you've got all that whole Segretticrap in there. I want somebody to say, nowlook, here are the facts. None of the White House people were involved. There are noother higher-ups. The White House was notinvolved. Put a cap around it. And, and second...EHRLICHMAN:More than that --PRESIDENT:...and then face the Segretti crap.EHRLICHMAN:I, I, in, in forcing this out, Dean remainsa problem and, and, uh, here's -- uh, let me just read you what I've come to on that...PRESIDENT:Alright.EHRLICHMAN:..."John Dean has not involved himself inthis matter as your counsel for severalmonths and properly so. I should notcontinue to fill in for him," meaning me, "for several reasons, including the impermissible demands on my time that are -involved.REEL 2 BEGINSYou need a full-time special counsel tofollow these related problems who can adviseyou of the legal niceties from his experience in constitutional, criminal and governmental practice. I'll be happy tocontinue to consult with him, and so on. Ido not recommend that Dean take a leave. That is neither in nor out. He has involvedhimself to the extent described above.Either thatREEL 1 ENDSrequires dismissal or it does not. And thatchoice should be made at once. If he isdischarged, the U.S. Attorney and the Grand Jury should treat him differently. But I think he's, he -- you've got to bite thebullet on Dean, one way or the other, prettyquick.PRESIDENT:Alright. But...EHRLICHMAN:But recognize, uh,...HALDEMAN:What did Dean say to... EHRLICHMAN:...but recognize... HALDEMAN:...what did Dean say to...EHRLICHMAN:that kills him.HALDEMAN:Dean's. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah basically he says that kills him.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) and he got off with pleabargaining for a misdemeanor.HALDEMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:A misdemeanor. HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:That's all the God-damn thing ever was.HALDEMAN:Yeah. And he got an undetermined sentencethat was suspended Friday.PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:He never served an hour in jail.PRESIDENT:Didn't serve in jail and then, but, but, notonly -- you see, Bob --HALDEMAN:He was indicted on a felony...PRESIDENT:He did not -- indicted on a felony...HALDEMAN:Pled to a -- PRESIDENT:Plea, plea-bargained to a misdemeanor, getsoff with, uh, no sentence and so forth and,and Dash defends him and says that -- and Lipschitz goes out and the Post prints reams of stuff that he...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...is an honorable man and so forth. Nowwhat really --HALDEMAN:He had already been indicted on two other -- PRESIDENT:How in the hell, who got the, got that storyout (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Well, they, apparently, the two or threepapers got wind of it, but the interestingthing is that Dash had made the moraljudgment...PRESIDENT:Earlier. HALDEMAN:...that, that didn't disqualify him, he knewabout it.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:And Dash has a beautiful statement on thefront page of the paper which is a manwouldn't be as good an investigator if he hadn't been in...PRESIDENT:Unless he knew how to bug.HALDEMAN:...(unintelligible). No, unless he had --been in trouble a couple of, one or two times.EHRLICHMAN:Ervin must have looked at that and...SEVERALVOICES:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:...and he talked aboutEHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:...man wouldn't have been a true campaignerif he hadn't had a prank or two once in a while.PRESIDENT:Well, what I'm getting at is this, that uh,we're just talking here, not with Dean -- we're talking about Dean naturally -- youcall my attention to Lipschitz' thing only Idon't give a damn about the part of this with Hunt, Liddy, and the Cuban...UNIDENTIFIED:True.PRESIDENT:...(Unintelligible) are in this thing. Itwould be my (tape noise) a reasonable timehad expired after the thing (unintelligible,with tape noise) and before I leave officeand they'll get off. You get them full pardons. That's what they have to have, John.EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:Do you agree? EHRLICHMAN:Yep, I sure do. Well, you haven't asked mehow I'd come out on this. I just, I justbrought it to a focus. I think if you have to decide up or down on Dean now...PRESIDENT:What do you think about that? Oh, let'ssee. What, what does Dean say when you tellhim that?EHRLICHMAN:He doesn't agree with that.PRESIDENT:I know he doesn't agree, but what does hedo?EHRLICHMAN:He wants to stay and just disconnect himselffrom this case. And he says, "Yes, that'sright, make your decision now, but make yourdecision that I should stay." He needn't decide that right this minute and I would encourage him not to...PRESIDENT:I mean.EHRLICHMAN:...but in talking about Rush, that relatesto this general subject. I think I wouldpass it for the moment.PRESIDENT:But the only thing that I was -- yeah, Iagree you should --EHRLICHMAN:And, and, uh, get back to, get back to theMitchell thing which really is, uh...PRESIDENT:Like today. I know. EHRLICHMAN:...uh, like this morning.PRESIDENT:I don't think there's anybody that can talkto Mitchell except somebody that knows this case. Now, there's one or two people, I mean I -- versed myself in it enough to knowthe God-damn thing, but I'm not sure that Iwant to know. I want to say Mitchell, "Now, look, I, I think that, I think that you're -- the attorneys for the Committee, O'Brien -- and I found out this, and I found outthat, and I found out that, and the GrandJury has told me this th-th-th-th-th- dee." I just don't know. I just don't -- you know what I mean. They talk about my going outis, uh -- but really, I am not trying toduck it. I, I don't mind, I've done unpleasant things and I'll take this in oneminute. Uh, the thing, John, is thatthere's nobody really that can do it except you.- And I know-how Mitchell feels. But you conducted this investigation. I would -- the way I would do it, Bob, you, youcritique this, is I'd go up, and I'd say,...HALDEMAN:Alright.PRESIDENT:..."The President's asked me to see you."That you have come in today with this report; these are the cold facts indicating; of course, that this does not indicate that,but the Grand Jury is moving swiftly,Magruder will be indicted, you think. Under the circumstances, time is of the essence. You can't be in a position of having you(tape noise) the Grand Jury and (tape noise)(unintelligible) "I am responsible, I did not know it. But I assume theresponsibility. Nobody in the White Houseis involved," and so forth, and so on. "We did try to help these defendants after- wards, yes." He probably would not deny thatanyway. He probably was not asked that atan earlier time. But the, just as the clef- , just as any, the defendants are entitledto that sort of --EHRLICHMAN:Well now you're, you're glossing it. Uh, Idon't think he could do that.PRESIDENT:All right.EHRLICHMAN:I wouldn't want to, I wouldn't want toPRESIDENT:All right. EHRLICHMAN:...have you...PRESIDENT:Oh all right.EHRLICHMAN:...(unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Fine, fine. What would you say to him?EHRLICHMAN:I'd say (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:Let me, let me hear your speech(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I'd say, "The jig, you know, basically thejig is up, John, and uh, I've listened to,uh, Magruder and, and, uh, uh, uh, he'sgonna, he's in my opinion he's about to blow, uh, uh, and that's, that's the laststraw." Uh --PRESIDENT:And, also, Hunt is going to testify,Tuesday, Monday, we understand.EHRLICHMAN:"We've got to, we've got to think of thisthing from the standpoint of the Presidentand I know you have been right along and that's the reason you've been conductingyourself as you have."PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:"It, it's now time, I think, to rethink whatbest serves the President and also what bestserves you..."PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:"...in the ultimate outcome of this thing." PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:"And we have to, have to, recognize that youare not going to escape indictment. There's no way and..."PRESIDENT:Because -- yeah. Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:"...the far better, far better that youshould be prosecuted on an information from the U.S. Attorney based on yourconversation with the U.S. Attorney, thanon an indictment by a Grand Jury of, of 15 blacks and 3 whites, uh, after, uh, uh, thiskind of uh, this kind of an...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:"...investigation." PRESIDENT:We're right on the door of the White Houseand we're trying to protect you.EHRLICHMAN:"If, if the Grand Jury goes this way, you'vebeen dragged in by the heels. Uh, if you godown first thing Monday morning, or yet thisafternoon..."PRESIDENT:This afternoon. EHRLICHMAN:"...and talk to the U.S. Attorney, and say,'Okay I want to make a statement,' then twothings happen: one, you get credit forcoming forward; two, you serve the President's interest. And, uh, I'm here inbehalf of the President --"HALDEMAN:Well, and three, you have the dignifiedopportunity to discuss this in, in the, office of...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...of Earl Silbert instead of in the thirdWashington jail.EHRLICHMAN:"And, and I'm here at the President'srequest to ask you to do that..."PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:"He has reviewed the facts now..."PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:"He has no alternative, John... PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:"...but..."PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:"...to send me here and..." PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:"...ask you to do this."PRESIDENT:Right, well, then, if you want to hear itpersonally, he, he, he, uh...EHRLICHMAN:Pick up the phone.PRESIDENT:No. Come down and see him.HALDEMAN:I have a couple of modifications to that.One, a minor ques-- not to what you say, butin setting it up. It would be helpful, indoing that, if I called Mitchell and said that the President wants you to talk with him. Then there's no question...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...in his mindPRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...that you're, you're operating... PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...unilaterally.EHRLICHMAN:Absolutely.PRESIDENT:Right, right. HALDEMAN:And, secondly, that if at all possible, heshould come down here.EHRLICHMAN:Why is that? HALDEMAN:Well, my reason for it is, A, you get himhere under your circumstances. B. if youmake your case, which you may(unintelligible) at this point...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...'cause he may be on the same track.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...maybe at the same point. PRESIDENT:Yeah.-HALDEMAN:If he is, you might be able then to swing a"let's get Silbert right now and go on over." Ah, he may say, I've got to talk tothe President before I do this.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:And then run him in to do it.PRESIDENT:Um, well, let me say, let me say this, uh,I've, I've run, run through my mind, uh, the, the thoughts. And believe me the idea of Rogers, as you, John, as Bob will tellyou, is not, is not one that, uh, that Idon't think is, is potentially good. I was hoping to get him in, in a bigger -- but I,I know Rogers like the back of my hand andRogers does not fight real, mean tough problems and he will not go.HALDEMAN:The trouble with Rogers is that Mitchellwill overrun him. Mitchell will say, "Bill,you're out of your fucking mind. If youknew what I knew -- I mean those kids overat the White House are, are looking at me and, uh, and, uh --PRESIDENT:What if you knew what I knew, what aboutthem?HALDEMAN:Well, he'd roll his eyes and, and Rogerswouldn't know one way or the other.PRESIDENT:You see, John, somebody has to talk to himwho knows the facts. That's the point.HALDEMAN:And as I mentioned (unintelligible, withtape noise) thing in your scenario thatreally worries me when you say I've listenedto Magruder --EHRLICHMAN:Well, all, all right, I can't say it quitethat waySEVERALVOICES:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...what Magruder's gonna do.EHRLICHMAN:I can say...PRESIDENT:We have learned from... EHRLICHMAN:I can, I -- PRESIDENT:...we have learned that Magruder is going totestify.EHRLICHMAN:I can say, well, I can start out by saying,look, I can't vouch for any of this firsthand. A tremendous amount of what I know issecond-hand, like my conversation with Paul O'Brien, but I have every reason to think that Magruder is in a frame of mind rightnow to go down there and tell every- thinghe knows.PRESIDENT:That Hunt's going to go Monday(unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Hunt's going to go Monday. PRESIDENT:...and Liddy, well, you can't say Liddy EHRLICHMAN:Well --PRESIDENT:...maybe Mitchell has a feel--EHRLICHMAN:I have, I have reason to think Liddy hasalready talked.HALDEMAN:You know Rothblatt knows who(unintelligible) Rothblatt. So they're obviously moving on the cover-up.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:See, if Mitchell went in, that might knockthat whole week into a cocked hat.PRESIDENT:Why?HALDEMAN:Well, what do they care about the cover-upany more? They --PRESIDENT:Humph.EHRLICHMAN:Well, they might, but they, but, you see,Mitchell -- if Mitchell gave them a complete statementPRESIDENT:I wish they wouldn't, but (unintelligible)they would, Bob.EHRLICHMAN:...if Mitchell gave them a completestatement --PRESIDENT:They shouldn't, I mean, you're right. Imean, the, the, the cover-up, he said that, uh -- said well that basically it's a separate crime. Isn't that right, John?EHRLICHMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:Do you think they would keep going on thecover up even if Mitchell went in?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I would assume so. I would certainlyassume so. You see, they're got to explain to the Ervin Committee some day why they do things and they've got a hell of a lead.They're really not in shape to stop at thispoint. They would certainly be diverted.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible with tape noise) is this,that everything relating to this and all thefringes of it and all the, well, any other - -EHRLICHMAN:I think they're in a position to uh -- I, Ijust don't know (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Yeah, that's right. EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:But the point is what, what they have that -- they, their relations have been primarilywith Dean.HALDEMAN:I don't know about Colson. EHRLICHMAN:I don't either.HALDEMAN:Well, Dean is --PRESIDENT:I have to bite the Dean bullet today. EHRLICHMAN:I didn't say that. I didn't say that, but Ithink it, it is, it is a dependent question.And, uh, if you are in a situation where Mitchell stonewalls you...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...and walks out and says you know, to hellwith you guys, I've got to, I've got to live my own life.PRESIDENT:Well, let's say, uh, we could uh, uh, what,I want to look at my watch, not because of an appointment.EHRLICHMAN:You've got a dentist appointment.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I've been here since eighto'clock this morning.EHRLICHMAN:That's why? SEVERALVOICES:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Don't worry about that. No, that's noproblem. I could have got Haig to -- but,I, uh, John Dean out of the Grand Jury.EHRLICHMAN:Let me get around that by sug-, suggestingwhat I think his response would be.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:His response will be, "Look, Ehrlichman,you're supposed to be a lawyer. You know better. To go to somebody who is a targetin an inquiry of this kind and try topressure into giving up his rights is very antithesis of what rights I would have if I were a defendantPRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:"Uh you're supposed to, you're in theexecutive branch, and a government official,you're supposed to tell me what, what allthe chips are.PRESIDENT:Uh, that, that chair's gone. HALDEMAN:Oh.SEVERAL VOICES: (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...a couple and fall on the floor whichwould not be --PRESIDENT:Go ahead Steve.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, "you're supposed to tell me, uh, that Ihave a right to counsel and, uh, you know, read me the, the uh, Supreme Court thing(unintelligible) and so forth. Instead ofthat, you just suggested that I, uh, I divest myself of all my rights, and, uh, anduh, you, uh, asked me down here for a highlyimproper conversation. You haven't even suggested that I bring my attorney. And I take it what you are doing, is, uh, you'reacting as the, uh, prosecutor in this case."How do you come off doing that?PRESIDENT:He won't do that, in my opinion. Uh I thinkhe's more likely to say,"well God-damn it,look, John, we -- don't you know that thereare people in the White House that are deeply involved in this. Don't you knowthat Colson and Haldeman...HALDEMAN:He may say this, yeah. PRESIDENT:"...pressured this poor boy over here" Ithink Mitchell will take the offensive.Don't you agree? Bob?HALDEMAN:You see, I'm not at all sure but whatMitchell may think I am involved. I'm surehe probably thinks Colson's involved,because Magruder has used that. I would guess that the line Magruder has used with Mitchell -- and you might have to playMagruder's tape recording for him(unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Well I don't think, I don't think that'llhappen. I just don't.HALDEMAN:Well, I just --PRESIDENT:Is Magruder planning to go see Mitchell?HALDEMAN:Yes, sir, and it's -- if he decides to go,if he decides to talk.PRESIDENT:If he decides to talk, he's convinced... HALDEMAN:And he's about on the verge, his -- I, Iassume from that conversation that what hehas decided, he is either going to talk or he's going to take the Fifth. He's notgoing to lie, over and over.PRESIDENT:But, they're not calling him -- they may notcall him back, that's always --EHRLICHMAN:That's correct. (Unintelligible) Liddy willnever try it.PRESIDENT:Well the Fifth (unintelligible). HALDEMAN:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:He says, I know I'm going to be arrested. Iknow I'm on my way to jail. All right, if, if Mitchell comes back with a line like that, you're not serving the President,well, if you have made any kind ofinvestigation surely you know people in the White House are involved.PRESIDENT:What do you say?EHRLICHMAN:I say, "look, John, we're past the pointwhere we can be concerned about whether people in the White House are involved.We're not protecting the President by hopingthis thing is going go go away."PRESIDENT:The people in the White House are going totestify.EHRLICHMAN:The thing is not going to go away, John, andby your sitting up there in New York and pretending that it is, it's just making itworse. And it's been getting steadily worseon account of your sitting up there for the last couple of months. We're at the point now where we have no choice but to ask youto do this.HALDEMAN:We have a whole, and you could say, we havea whole series of people who have remainedmum in order not to create problems for you,who, it's now clear, can no longer remainmum. They don't intend to create problemsfor you, but, I mean...PRESIDENT:Like Hunt, Liddy? HALDEMAN:No. I mean like Haldeman, Dean --EHRLICHMAN:I could say that when I got into this Idiscovered that there were all kinds of people sitting around here who had bits ofinformation. They were hanging on to them,becuase they didn't know where they led...PRESIDENT:Well - - EHRLICHMAN:...and because they were afraid they wouldhurt John Mitchell. And I've had to putthis whole thing together. And now, having put it together...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) you guys received word hecomes down --EHRLICHMAN:...it, there's just no escape from it, justno escape.HALDEMAN:And it's got to be proved whether, uh,any...PRESIDENT:The adversary type. There's nobody that cando it --HALDEMAN:He will be able to persuade anyone elsethere is a way.PRESIDENT:But, there is nobody else that can do it.Also (pause) let me digress a moment before we get to the (unintelligible) of Mitchell. Another indication of the, the problem we'vegot here, uh, is -- which is related to whatwe talked about last night -- is to just to keep a, a posture vis-a-vis the Committee onthis. Uh, I just think we are in animpossible position frankly, with regard to White House people not appearing before the Committee. Now you've gone over that withZiegler and he still thinks we shouldstonewall it on those grounds.HALDEMAN:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And I've, I have not talked with him atlength for days.**********PRESIDENT:Well, I hear you've got the -- I, was justlooking in the paper this morning -- uh, Saxbe, Mathias, Johnny Rhodes, JohnAnderson, Aiken. Well, of course, two orthree of those names are not new, but they're all there...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...they are trying to build that up as achorus of Republicans and more will come.EHRLICHMAN:They'll get five a day for the next month.HALDEMAN:Bet they don't. Bet -- what's interestingis on a universal chorus he must appear before the Committee.PRESIDENT:Well --HALDEMAN:Thus, if you've got some saying they've gotto set up a way to take secret testimony...[Part III]HALDEMAN:Yeah, and it's a little difficult here be-cause our people are trained to cooperate.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:...when Weicker's office calls.PRESIDENT:You can say that, you can say Senator, now,uh, uh, we, we, we're not gonna turn this down unless you tell us to. And uh, and wejust, just want you to know that uh, thatuh, if you want us to go ahead, why we'll arrange for them to do it. But we want you to, for you to be told, uh, you know what Imean.HALDEMAN:Use the specific call (unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Good reason to call him.HALDEMAN:(Tape noise) North Carolina this week.********** PRESIDENT:(Tape noise) we came full circle on the Mit-, on the Mitchell thing.UNIDENTIFIED:Who?PRESIDENT:On the Mitchell thing (unintelligible) mustcome first...HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...(tape noise) something today. We've gotto make this move today. If it fails, uh,just to get back on position, I think youought to talk to Magruder.HALDEMAN:I agree.PRESIDENT:And you tell Magruder, "Now Jeb, thisevidence is coming in, you ought to go into the Grand Jury. Purge yourself if you're perjured, and tell this whole story."EHRLICHMAN:I agree.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible, with tape noise) PRESIDENT:The, we'll go -- Bob, you don't agree withthat?HALDEMAN:Oh, I do. PRESIDENT:Because I think we do have to. Third, we'v`got the problem --HALDEMAN:Maybe you should talk to Jeb first, though.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) John? EHRLICHMAN:Doesn't really matter, Bob, eh, either wayPRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...who is ever coming first. PRESIDENT:But then, you see, you see the point is--HALDEMAN:For God's sake, then don't use Jeb as abasis for the conversation.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Say that the evidence is not Jeb.I'd just simply say that just a lot of otherpeople with (unintelligible) Jeb...HALDEMAN:...although (unintelligible). PRESIDENT:...although he may blow (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:I can say, I can say that the the uh, uh,that I have, I have come to the conclusion that it is both John and Jeb who are liable- -PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...and, uh--PRESIDENT:But no, I meant... EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, go ahead. PRESIDENT:I was going to say that we are not talkingto you, John, just because Jeb is going tocrack...UNIDENTIFIED:Or that--PRESIDENT:...or that Dean is going to the Grand Jury.It's past that point. They've got the case made.HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:He'll say, "well I think they're bluffinghere." What'll you say?EHRLICHMAN:Uh, it isn't a question of bluffing. Uh,nobody's made any representations to us atall. Nobody's tried to bluff us...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Uh, it, it's just a question of puttingtogether all the facts and that any timesomeone--if the U.S. Attorney's office goes through the process that "I've gone through, he'll have all the facts. And there it'llbe. And ya, you don't get it all from anyone person. It's it's some from this one, some from that one. It's a typical, it's atypical case, Bob.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:How does Dean's, incidentally what is the,what is the, what is the liability or, uh,Hunt, or, uh--I'm thinking of the payoffthing...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...in this business,--somebody in, uh, Dean,Dean, uh, Dean asked, told me about the problem of Hunt's lawyer, uh, wanted--had gotten--this was a few weeks ago--needed,uh, needed sixty thousand or forty thousanddollars or something like that. You remember? He asked me about it and I saidI, I don't know where you can get it. Isaid I would, uh, I mean, I frankly felt hemight try to get it but I didn't know where.And then he left it up with Mitchell and Mitchell then said it was taken care of--am I correct? Is my recollection...EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Is that approximately correct? EHRLICHMAN:Yes, you could (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Did he talk to you about that?EHRLICHMAN:He talked to me about it. I said, John, Iwouldn't have the vaguest notion where to get it.PRESIDENT:Yeah--EHRLICHMAN:I saw him later in the day. I saw Mitchelllater in the day...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...Wednesday (unintelligible) PRESIDENT:What happened? EHRLICHMAN:And he just said it's taken care of.HALDEMAN:Mitchell raised the topic. He turned toDean and said, "what have you done about, uh, that other problem?" And Dean said--he kind of looked at us--and then said, "well,uh, you know, I, I don't know." And Mitchellsaid, "Oh' I guess that's been taken care of. (tape noise) said apparently throughLaRue.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:(tape noise) LaRue. Where you the one whotold me?EHRLICHMAN:Who told you?HALDEMAN:...Oh, Dean told us. LaRue. He had, Deanhad a long talk with LaRue and LaRue said,"this whole thing is ridiculous now" andsaid (unintelligible, with tape noise) said, "yeah," he said, "If I were in charge of this now what I would do is I'd get a largebus and I'd put the President at the wheeland I'd throw everybody we've got around here in it and I'd drive up to the Senateand I'd have the President open the door andI'd say, you all get out and tell everythingyou know and I'll be back to pick you up when you're through." He said, "It's all out now and there's nothing we can do about it."And he, he said, "I can," he said, LaRuealso said, "you know, I can't figure out how I got into this, uh, to begin with, but I,I, it seems to me all of us have been drawnin here in trying to cover up for John."PRESIDENT:For Mitchell? HALDEMAN:Yeah, which is exactly what's happened.PRESIDENT:LaRue said that?HALDEMAN:Yes. PRESIDENT:He's right. (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:And if LaRue is called, LaRue is, is--intends to tell the truth about it.PRESIDENT:Is he? HALDEMAN:Yeah. Now, I--PRESIDENT:Well, what will be his defense...HALDEMAN:I don't know. PRESIDENT:...about obstruction? HALDEMAN:I don't know.EHRLICHMAN:I don't think he-has one.HALDEMAN:If he doesn't intend-- PRESIDENT:No, well, no. His obstruction will be --LaRue'll, uh, that I was helping to get --EHRLICHMAN:Ah, the way Dean talks LaRue wasn't eventhinking about the message.HALDEMAN:I don't think LaRue cares. I think LaRue'sfigured that the jig is up.EHRLICHMAN:(Tape noise) I--a bit of incidentalintelligence that (unintelligible) droppedyesterday with regard to Mardian. Just asmall matter--went out to Phoenix (tape noise).--elaborate cover story, which he fed to the New York Times, which would lay itall back in the White House.(unintelligible with tape noise) Just gonnaknow that if they do (unintelligible) getscrewed.UNIDENTIFIED:--Yeah, they've gotten to-- EHRLICHMAN:It will only stand so long as Mitchellstands.PRESIDENT:Why lay it at the White House?EHRLICHMAN:That's all that--but I just don't know anyother fact and, uh--PRESIDENT:Well, he could lay it to the White House?EHRLICHMAN:But bear in, bear in mind Shapiro was givingme this in a whole litany of things that were, that were persuasive and which...PRESIDENT:Yep, yep.HALDEMAN:I'm still afraid of Shapiro. EHRLICHMAN:...what he said to me (unintelligible) he'sa scary guy.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) I don't believe we can--REEL 3 BEGINSPRESIDENT:Uh, but what I meant on the Mardian, thepoint that, uh,--let me say, I don't thinkthat Mardian or LaRue or Mitchell, uh, orMagruder or anybody want to hurt thePresident in this thing.REEL 2 ENDS.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:I'm sure that's right.PRESIDENT:Do you feel that way?HALDEMAN:Yes sir. PRESIDENT:Colson? How, how about Colson? HALDEMAN:He, he--I (unintelligible) said he'll doeverything he can not to hurt the President.PRESIDENT:Yeah. That has got to be the attitude ofeverybody because it isn't the man, it's theGoddamn office.HALDEMAN:Sure. Sure. PRESIDENT:But also it happens to be tr-, true. I meanI (unintelligible) I knew about the son-of-a-bitch.HALDEMAN:You don't have a, that doesn't apply andthey didn't--I think rationalize to themselves that hurting or getting anybody else could be...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...good for the President rather than bad.And that...PRESIDENT:In other words--HALDEMAN:...includes Ehrlichman, Haldeman,... PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...Dean...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...certainly Colson. Colson'd be at the topof that list. Colson first, then Haldeman,then Dean, then Ehrlichman.PRESIDENT:You see I think a Mardian story to the Timeswill be, frankly, that Colson put the heat on.HALDEMAN:Well, maybe, but he's gonna last. Thatcould be where you--PRESIDENT:Maybe Haldeman? HALDEMAN:Mardian. No, Mardian, I don't think has anypersonal desire to get me. I think hewould--I know he hates Colson.PRESIDENT:Does he?HALDEMAN:They all do. And any Mitchell person does,'cause Mitchell did.PRESIDENT:You can make, you see, you can make a hellof a circumstantial case on Colson. He'sthe guy that, you know, he's Dean's buddy,and uh, Liddy, he knew well, apparently knew well--HALDEMAN:Wasn't Dean's buddy.PRESIDENT:I'm sorry--I meant Hunt's buddy. HALDEMAN:Yeah, right. PRESIDENT:Of course, right. But you know, but, Imean, Colson is closer to this group ofrobbers than anybody else. That's theproblem with Colson. Colson's got a very--HALDEMAN:He has no tie to Liddy. PRESIDENT:Oh, no, no. Okay. HALDEMAN:You know, that is the (unintelligible) hehas no, no string to it. His string is toHunt.PRESIDENT:Well, then Hunt--HALDEMAN:Hunt is the, Hunt is the central, uh,background figure that--PRESIDENT:Is, uh, Hunt, uh, Hunt takes this money?(Unintelligible) he took it for what? Tocover up?HALDEMAN:Immunity. Bet Bittman's given immunity. PRESIDENT:They're going to give Hunt immunity?HALDEMAN:I don't know, maybe, I suppose.EHRLICHMAN:I think that would be their deal. PRESIDENT:Well, that's the standard--(Unintelligible)give him immunity for additional crimes?EHRLICHMAN:He's convicted now, you see, so it would befor additional--HALDEMAN:They haven't sentenced him. EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:So they could give him immunity--(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:...they could, they could, cut his sentenceand give him immunity for the cover-up; thehush money; clemency. How do you handle the problem of clemency, John?EHRLICHMAN:You'd have to stonewall that--it's, it's,it's--a cold fact, cold denialUnintelligible)HALDEMAN:Well, you don't handle it at all. That'sColson's main point because that's where itcomes from.EHRLICHMAN:That was the line of communication-- PRESIDENT:Colson to Bittman? Well that's the onlything that we have on that, except Mitchell,apparently, had said something aboutclemency to people.HALDEMAN:To Liddy. PRESIDENT:And Mitchell has never, never disc--has heever discussed clemency with you, Bob?HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:Has he ever discussed it with you? EHRLICHMAN:No.PRESIDENT:Needless to say, not with me. The onlyterms (unintelligible) we were all here in the room.HALDEMAN:I think--EHRLICHMAN:The only time--HALDEMAN:...he may have said, well, you know, we'vegot to take care of these people, and, uh--PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well, I understand that. But he'snever said, "Look you're gonna get a pardon for these people when this is over." Never used any such language around here, has he,John?EHRLICHMAN:Not to me. HALDEMAN:I don't think so. PRESIDENT:With Dean has he?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I don't know.HALDEMAN:That's a question (unintelligible) PRESIDENT:'Cause Dean's never raised it. In fact,Dean told me an interesting thing I said,Dean, I said, "John," I said, uh, "where's it all lead?" He said, "uh." I said "what's it going to cost? Now you could continuethis of course." He said about a milliondollars. I said facetiously, "Have you thought of this at all?" (Unintelligible)That's the point. That's the foul-up in thewhole Mitsel erg-, Mitchell argument. Unless I could just up and say, "100k fellows, it, it's too bad and, and, and I,I, I could, I could give you executiveclemency, like tomorrow. What the hell do you think, do you think, Dean, I mean do youthink that, that--the point is, Hunt and theCubans are going to sit on their ass in jailfor four years and their families not taken care of? That's the point. Now where the hell to you get the money for that?" That'sthe reason this whole thing falls. I mean,uh-, uh, it's, it's that, that, I mean, uh, that astonishes me about Mitchell and therest.EHRLICHMAN:Improbable. PRESIDENT:Not only improbable, there's no way to getthe money is there? Who was it, Tom Pappasthey had to see me?HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) about the money. PRESIDENT:Huh?HALDEMAN:You didn't talk to him about the money?PRESIDENT:I don't remember. You told me to see him.In fact, you said that he was helping on the--HALDEMAN:But, yeah, but you were seeing him and youwere seeing a number of contributors.PRESIDENT:I know, I know and I said hell, I appreciatethe work you're doing for us and I didn'tmention what it was.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Good old...HALDEMAN:He was Mitchell's contact.PRESIDENT:Good old Tom is raising money apparently,he's doing this, this thing--HALDEMAN:That's right. I doubt that he is--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) the word, the word nevercame up, but, uh, I said I appreciate what you're doing. I do, I do for the purpose ofhelping the poor bastards through the trial,but you can't after that, John. You can't or could you? I guess you could. Attorneys' fees? Could you, could you get asupport program for these people for, forfour years?EHRLICHMAN:I haven't any idea. I have no idea.PRESIDENT:Well, they've supported other people injail...EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:...for years. EHRLICHMAN:The Berrigans or somebody.PRESIDENT:Huh?EHRLICHMAN:I say, I don't know how the Berriganbrothers and some of those...PRESIDENT:They all have funds.EHRLICHMAN:...operate. I think those they use-- PRESIDENT:Yes, there are funds, (unintelligible) aredeveloped. I guess that's true.EHRLICHMAN:So that they--.PRESIDENT:But not to hush up. EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:That's the point. All right. One finalthing: Dean. You, you don't think we have to bite it today?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'm not so sure. Uh, I'd, I'd beinclined--say you are (unintelligible).When you say bite it it's simply a matter of making a decision, in, in my opinion, uh--PRESIDENT:Well, I've made a decision. I think he hasto go.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'm not sure that's the rightdecision. It's uh, uh, uh, by, by framingthe issue, I don't mean to imply that...PRESIDENT:Oh, I see. EHRLICHMAN:...that's the (unintelligible). PRESIDENT:I thought, no, no, I thought...EHRLICHMAN:Uh, (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:When, when you said you didn't address it,I, I'm sorry, I thought that was one of therecommendations you had made.EHRLICHMAN:No, no, my recommendation is that yourecognize that, there's a go-no go decision that has to be...PRESIDENT:Oh, I see.EHRLICHMAN:...made right away.PRESIDENT:Oh, alright, yeah. EHRLICHMAN:You see, here's your situation as I--Lookagain--the big picture--You now arepossessed of a body of fact.PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:And you've got to, you can't just sit here.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:You've got to act on it. PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...You've got to make some, you got to makesome decisions and the Dean thing is one ofthe decisions that you have to make. Now you may decide--PRESIDENT:[on telephone] Bull, please. Steve Bull.[To Ehrlichman] (unintelligible) Alright, fine, John.EHRLICHMAN:Eh, eh--PRESIDENT:...Then you're not.EHRLICHMAN:Then you've got to dispose of it one way orthe other. Uh, uh, there may be and, and, I'm, I'm--(Phone rings)PRESIDENT:[on telephone] Yeah, put the, uh, that, uh,thing with, uh, uh, Haig, uh, back. Whattime you got now? Quarter after. I'll bethere a few minutes late at the EOB. [Hangs up telephone]EHRLICHMAN:I'll tell you, I am still heavily persuaded-that we affect the Grand Jury and U.S.Attorney treatment of Dean favorably by keeping him on.PRESIDENT:Okay.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, and that that's important. Now-- PRESIDENT:Why, why, do you say that? Because theylike him?EHRLICHMAN:No, no, not at all.HALDEMAN:Because they can treat him differently asthe President's counsel than--EHRLICHMAN:As the dismissed President's counsel-- HALDEMAN:Exactly. PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:It's just that it's a very heavypsychological factor.PRESIDENT:Well, this will be done, because there isanother reason, too. It isn't like, it--Dean is not like Mitchell, now let's face it.HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Dean is not like Mitchell in the sense thatDean only tried to do what he could to pick up the Goddamn pieces and...HALDEMAN:Certainly.PRESIDENT:...everybody else around here knew it had tobe done.EHRLICHMAN:Certainly.PRESIDENT:Uh, let's face it. I'm not blaming anybodyelse now.HALDEMAN:I understand. PRESIDENT:That was his job.HALDEMAN:I understand.EHRLICHMAN:I have, I have great trouble in(unintelligible) that you could be involvedin the light of the known involvement thathe had...PRESIDENT:After the? EHRLICHMAN:...in the aftermath.PRESIDENT:Right, but--EHRLICHMAN:But-- HALDEMAN:The known involvement in the aftermath wasfor, uh, what was understood here to be theproper (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:That's half-- PRESIDENT:The question is motive.HALDEMAN:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:That's number one. Number two, there isnothing new about that.PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:As I have developed in this thing--I'd likeyou to read this.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:There were eight or ten people around herewho knew about this, knew it was going on.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Bob knew, I knew, all kinds of people knew. PRESIDENT:Well, I knew it. I knew it.EHRLICHMAN:And it was not a question of whether--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I knew I must say though, Ididn't know it, but I must have assumed itthough, but you know, fortunately--and Ithank you both for arranging it that way and it does show why the isolation of the President, isn't a bad position to be in.EHRLICHMAN:(Laughs)PRESIDENT:But the first time that I knew that they hadto have the money was the time when, uh, Dean told me that they needed forty thousanddollars. I hadn't been rege-, I didn't, Ijust didn't, I closed my eyes, I couldn't read the Goddamn papers on those littleenvelopes. I didn't know about theenvelopes and the (unintelligible) and all that stuff.EHRLICHMAN:Well, the, the...PRESIDENT:But others did know.EHRLICHMAN:...the point is that, that if Dean's, if thewrong-doing which justifies Dean's dismissalis his knowledge that that operation wasgoing on...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...then you can't stop with him. You've gotto go through the whole place wholesale.PRESIDENT:Fire the whole staff.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. It's, it's a question ofmotive. It's a question of role, and Idon't think Dean's role in the aftermath, at least from the facts that I know now, achieves a level of wrongdoing that requiresthat you terminate him.PRESIDENT:Nah. EHRLICHMAN:...And, and, that, and this other thing --PRESIDENT:I think you've made a very powerful point tome that, that -- of course, you can be pragmatic and say, "Well, Christ, in fact Dean" and so forth -- in other words cutyour losses and get rid of 'em. I mean,give 'em an hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course. Goout, John Dean. On the other hand, uh, itis true others did know, they did know.EHRLICHMAN:But more than that -- we've made Dean afocal point in the Gray process....PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...And he will become a focal point in theErvin process.PRESIDENT:Well, we'll have -- yes, except if --HALDEMAN:Yeah, if, if goes on.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:And if you dismiss him he'll still be afocal point.EHRLICHMAN:He'll be a focal point. (Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:He'll be a defrocked -- with a less, withless protection, that's right.EHRLICHMAN:And with less incentive.PRESIDENT:Well, the point that I think, I think Dean --HALDEMAN:That's also one of Dean's problem.PRESIDENT:Dean's-- HALDEMAN:What Dean did was all proper... PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...in terms of the higher good.PRESIDENT:Dean--you've gotta have a talked with Dean.I feel that I should not talked to him.EHRLICHMAN:I have talk to him. PRESIDENT:But--I mean about motives. EHRLICHMAN:I have talked to him.PRESIDENT:What's he say about motives? He says it washush up?EHRLICHMAN:No. He says he knew, he, he had to knowthat people were, uh, trying to bring thatresult about...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...and he says, you know, the way I got intothis was I would go to meetings in, in...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...campaign headquarters, uh, and, uh, uh,we'd get through the meeting and uh,Mitchell and LaRue would say to, to, uh, uh, I mean Mardian and LaRue would say to Mitchell, "Mitch, you've got to do somethingabout this." And Mitchell's stock answerwas to turn to John Dean.HALDEMAN:Say what are you gonna do? EHRLICHMAN:"What are you going to do?"PRESIDENT:Jesus Christ.EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, so John said, I got to be a kindof, kind of a water carrier. I'd come backfrom those meetings and I'd come in to seeBob, or me or somebody else...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...and say well, Mitchell's got this bigproblem. And then he'd say they'd say tome, well I don't know what I'll do about it.PRESIDENT:When he came in to see Bob and you whatwould he say was the problem?EHRLICHMAN:Uh, he'd say, these, these guys, uh, uh,Hunt's getting, uh, jittery and, uh, and says that he's got to have umpty-umpthousand dollars, and uh, Mitchell'sterribly worried about it, and uh, uh--it, it was never expressed, but it was certainlyunderstood...PRESIDENT:Okay, on the question of motive then,though, (unintelligible) those conversations to keep up (unintelligible) that motive was never discussed.EHRLICHMAN:Never discussed with me in those terms.PRESIDENT:Right? UNIDENTIFIED:Uh, right.PRESIDENT:The motive was to help defendants who were,by golly, who had worked for the...EHRLICHMAN:Well... PRESIDENT:...campaign committee--EHRLICHMAN:...it never really got that far because, uh,we uh, at least my, my conversation with John always was, "well, you know that's,that's interesting--I just don't know whatto do for you."PRESIDENT:Yeah. And, he may have gone further withyou, Bob Did he?HALDEMAN:No.EHRLICHMAN:He, we referred him to Kalmbach. HALDEMAN:You aimed him at Kalmbach. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.HALDEMAN:I aimed him at Mitchell. I said, "John youcan't come here and ask for help, we don't have any."PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:The one thing where it did go further, ifyou want to argue about it, it was in the sense that th-, the 350...PRESIDENT:At the end--HALDEMAN:...which was not our money, we did move backover there.PRESIDENT:For this purpose?EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) what it was. HALDEMAN:Yeah, yeah. PRESIDENT:Who asked for it?HALDEMAN:Nobody.PRESIDENT:I mean, eh, how did, who...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) asked for that. PRESIDENT:...who took the move on the 350? HALDEMAN:I did.PRESIDENT:How did you know that (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Gordon Strachan... PRESIDENT:...came to you?HALDEMAN:...Gordon Strachan came to me after theelection and said you have three hundred and fifty thousand...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...dollars in cash...PRESIDENT:Oh... HALDEMAN:...What do you want to do with it...PRESIDENT:...this was not requested by LaRue?HALDEMAN:No. PRESIDENT:or Gordon? HALDEMAN:No, the problem was getting them to take itback. They wouldn't take it.EHRLICHMAN'Cause they didn't know how to(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:That money...HALDEMAN:'Cause LaRue didn't know what to do(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:...that, that money--HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) let him take it. LaRuewanted it...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...but Mitchell wouldn't let him take it.PRESIDENT:Oh.EHRLICHMAN:They just didn't know how to account for it. PRESIDENT:Well, just frankly, he wouldn't have toaccount for it, in my opinion.HALDEMAN:Well, but he didn't, he, he was--PRESIDENT:1970 money, for Christ's sakes.HALDEMAN:(Clears throat) He said I have to accountfor it now because he's--Fred LaRue is in personal receipt after Grand Jury knowledge of three hundred and twenty-eight thousanddollars in cash delivered to him at night athis apartment by Gordon Strachan. Key witnesses to that transaction are Strachanand LaRue.PRESIDENT:LaRue tells you, huh? HALDEMAN:And Strachan just testified that that's whathappened. Well, LaRue's got a problem.What did he do with it? At that point, it'sincome to him. He's got an IRS problem if he can't get it, get it--it's unaccounted.PRESIDENT:He'll use it, what, what does he say? Hesays I used it for hush money?HALDEMAN:I don't know what he'll say. He'll probably(tape noise) packaged it up--PRESIDENT:Does that help any? That certainly doesn'thelp us.HALDEMAN:Doesn't help anybody, but, uh, but, uh, youknow--PRESIDENT:The other thing he says, "Well I just, I,I've retained it in a fund for future campaigns."HALDEMAN:No, can't show it, doesn't have it. I'msure he doesn't have it.EHRLICHMAN:I don't, I'm not sure either, but I assumethat it went right out to, to pay thesepeople, I, uh, that's, that's my assumption.(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Now Dean says this. He says we have onlytwo problems with the aftermath in the WhiteHouse. One is the fact that we made a referral to Kalmbach, but he said that can be explained. And, that's, that's no majorproblem. The other is the $350,000 and thatcan be explained and need not be a major problem if it's clearly explained. And wehave no, no problem with the aftermath.HALDEMAN:I'm running the three-fifty into mystatement, but the question of whether wewant it in.PRESIDENT:Oh, yes. Put it in there. HALDEMAN:Nobody knows about it--that's anotherbombshell.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I think it's been, there'sbeen something written about it.HALDEMAN:Well but, yeah, but not that I had it.EHRLICHMAN:It is eleven o'clock. PRESIDENT:All right. Eleven o'clock, that's when thearmistice was signed, so off we go.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, Mitchell is roughly two hours away at,at best. I could--PRESIDENT:I think he's going to come down and do ittoday. I think--what--Bob, I think you haveto go out and call him, now. And, uh, ask him if he can come down.EHRLICHMAN:We'll send an airplane for him.HALDEMAN:That'll take longer than his coming(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:And by the time we get a plane mobilized andup there, it takes longer. We'll send it(tape noise) play golf or something.PRESIDENT:I know, I know. He may be gone. But thepoint that I make is this, if, if he's outto play golf, we say we have, uh, we, we, have an urgent message for him and we say there've been some (tape noise) there havebeen some (unintelligible with tape noise)on the Watergate thing.HALDEMAN:And that hurry and come immediately.PRESIDENT:(Tape noise) should come down.EHRLICHMAN:I think Bob's right. PRESIDENT:Okay. Can you come down? If he says Ican't come, then Ehrlichman should go up--HALDEMAN:Then say to him well, John will come up.Where can you be re--PRESIDENT:Yes. If he says well I've got a dinnertonight and I've got that, uh, say John.-- Imean this is the thing--John, this is very important. The President considers this of the highest urgency that you be aware ofthese developments. How's that sound toyou?UNIDENTIFIED:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Something that just can't be postponed anylonger.PRESIDENT:Can't be postponed and, uh, we, uh, have aproblem.(Walking noise)Harder than firing Hickel.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, about the same.PRESIDENT:Eleven?HALDEMAN(?):Yes, sir.[Haldeman leaves, Ehrlichman dialstelephone]EHRLICHMAN:Call me? Oh, OK. Anything new?...Yeah,I'm...Our last conversation?...Can you give it to me now?. Well, Okay. I, I'll see you in a little while. Alright.PRESIDENT:Colson?EHRLICHMAN:No, that was Dean. PRESIDENT:What' d he say?EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I, I think there's, there are other reasons--ERLICHMANWell, you can, you can put--PRESIDENT:He did not cover up, though, that's justwhat we, that's what (unintelligible) that's what we--EHRLICHMAN(Unintelligible) to go testify.(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:My point is, my point is that as three of ustalked here, I realize, that frankly--inMitchell's case he's guilty. In Dean's case(tape noise) it's the question. And I donot consider him guilty. Now that's allthere is to that.EHRLICHMAN:Uh-- PRESIDENT:...Because if he's, if, if that's the casethen hell, wouldn't you say, half the staffis guilty.EHRLICHMAN:That's it. He's, he's guilty of really nomore except in degree.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, and uh... PRESIDENT:Then others. EHRLICHMAN:...then, then a lot--PRESIDENT:And frankly, than I have been since, uh, aweek ago--EHRLICHMAN:Well...PRESIDENT:Two weeks ago,EHRLICHMAN:...you see, that isn't--that kind ofknowledge that we had was not action knowledge, like the kind of knowledge, thatI put together last night. I hadn't knownreally what, what's been bothering me this week...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...But what's been bothering me is--PRESIDENT:That with knowledge, we're still not doinganything.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. That's exactly right.PRESIDENT:The law and order--Goddamn it, that's theway I am. I, you know, it is a pain for me to do anything. The Mitchell thing isGoddamn painful.(Unintelligible with noise) [Haldeman enters room]PRESIDENT:Is he coming?HALDEMAN:Yes, sir.(Noise) I said do you want to let us know whatyou're, what plane you're on so we can pickyou up? And he said, no let me(unintelligible) over his, uh--PRESIDENT:Should you delay your meeting with Magruderuntil you see him?EHRLICHMAN:I don't think it really matters. It's just,it comes under this whole heading of having knowledge and having to act on it.PRESIDENT:Well, my point is that I think that youbetter see Magruder before you see him. No, no I guess you'll--EHRLICHMAN:It doesn't matter, in my opinion.PRESIDENT:You should see Magruder today. That's themain thing.EHRLICHMAN:I think we ought to make a similar call toMagruder.HALDEMAN:I think the way to do it then--I should callJeb...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and say that things have developed andall this and, and, uh--PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:I didn't say that to Mitchell. EHRLICHMAN:It doesn't matter.PRESIDENT:Oh, Mitchell, he knows better. (Tape noise)gotta say that to Jeb.HALDEMAN:Well, I tell you, when I--the thing is whenI say it to Jeb, it'll take probably thirty-seven seconds for him to turn up on yourdoorstep.EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's alright.PRESIDENT:That's alright.EHRLICHMAN:It won't-- PRESIDENT:I think we should do it before you seeMitchell. Or you, do you feel uncomfortableabout telling him?EHRLICHMAN:No. As I say, I, I think it's almostimmaterial as to which I see first. It'sthe fact of doing it rather than any particular sequence.PRESIDENT:Well--HALDEMAN:Mitchell won't be here, he can't be here'til...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I think, in my view, in my view, John, youcan't wait to act. I think you should see Jeb Magruder and say now, Jeb, you're totestify. (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:I wouldn't quite say it that way. I'll say,I don't know if you know what I've beendoing here, the last three weeks. I havebeen ranging over this whole subject matter trying to bring to the President something more than John Dean has charged.PRESIDENT:Can you tell him as you talk to him thatwhat he says is attorney-client or no? You can't tell him. Okay.EHRLICHMAN:I, I, I'll simply say that, as, as you know,Dean did an investigation which determinedwhether or nor the White House was involved. y responsibility was greater than that. twas to range over the whole thing and tryand bring to the President a new (tape noise) of information on what actually happened, (tape noise) uh, uh, version ofwhat transpired. And from what I have beenable to put together, I have advised the President and he has--this morning--and hehas directed me immediately to contact you(tape noise) uh, uh, having accepted a point of view in all of this (tape noise) people should not disclose what they know, becauseit somehow serves the President. (Tapenoise) apparently, considerable criminal jeopardy. (Tape noise) what to do from yourown standpoint. What I want you to have isthe message from the President. (Tape noise) in any way view it as serving his interests for you to remain silent. Decidewhat to do from your own personal standpointand (unintelligible) any right to interferein that decision. If there ever was an impediment to your coming forward by reason of your impression of, uh, uh, assumed orotherwise, of what the President wanted youto do I think it's my job...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...to impart to you what is actually thecase.PRESIDENT:I would, also, though I'd put a couple ofgrace notes in and say, Jeb, let me juststart here by telling you the President'sown great affection for you and for your family--real affection--my mind was thinkinglast night of his poor little kids inschool...HALDEMAN:Yeah, beautiful kids. PRESIDENT:...and his lovely wife and all the rest.And just, just put--it breaks your heart.And say this, this is a very painful message for me--for, for him to--I, I've been asked to give you, but, but, but I must do it andthat's that. Let's put it right out thatway. And also--I'd just put that in so that he knows that I have personal affection.That's the way to, that's the way the so-called clemency's got to be handled. Do you see, John? -EHRLICHMAN:I understand.HALDEMAN:Do the same thing with Mitchell.PRESIDENT:Yeah--oh, Mitchell? Well, you could say toMitchell, I think you've got to say...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:...you're got to say that this is thetoughest decision he's made. It's tougher than Cambodia, May 8th and December 18th puttogether. And that he, uh, just can't bringhimself to talk to you about it. Just can't do it. And he's directed that I talk toyou. Frankly, what I am doing, John, isputting you in the same position as President Eisenhower put me in with Adams(unintelligible) But John Mitchell, let mesay, will never go to prison. I agree withthat assumption. I think what will happen is that he will put on the Goddamnedest defense that--the point, you have, yoursuggestion is gonna be he not put on adefense. You're suggesting he go in and say look I am responsible here. I had noknowledge but I am responsible. And uh, Iuh, I, and nobody else had, and uh, that's it. I myself. That's it. And I want to plead, uh, this, this has got to stop--innocent people are being smeared in thisthing.EHRLICHMAN:He will understand...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:...that once you are possessed of areasonable body of knowledge, (unintelligible) you have an obligation todo something and, rather than simply to turnit over to the U.S. Attorney, the thing that you are doing, in the first instance is giving him an opportunity to come forward.PRESIDENT:Or, rather than having a special prosecutor,say that he comes a special prosecutor. The President rejects that. Uh, the idea that,uh, we turn it over to the U.S. Attorney,call him in, which I could do, and uh, or call in the Attorney General which I could do, but I think it's--obligations to do, dothis becuase I cannot have this. Now, ofcourse, he's going to ask, well, now John what knowledge do you really have excepthearsay. Answer.EHRLICHMAN:I don't have any knowledge except hearsay,John, uh, but--PRESIDENT:But I do know that Magruder--EHRLICHMAN:...in other words, I don't have, I don'thave documents and I...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Events are moving veryspeedily...EHRLICHMAN:...but, but... PRESIDENT:There is no question about what is going tohappen.EHRLICHMAN:...there can be--that's right. That'sright. Tha-, the-, that--HALDEMAN:You won't have to appeal to him on thatbecause he's made the point, you know, thatif Dean testifies, it's going to unscramblethe whole omelet.PRESIDENT:Well, I'm sorry--I don't want to leave it atthe point that Dean's or Magruder'stestimony is essential to Mitchell (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:That's right. That's right.PRESIDENT:You see that's the point of that. On theDean thing, I, I wouldn't say that the President has stood, frankly, John, on, onthe executive privilege thing,(unintelligible) and so forth.EHRLICHMAN:It, it, it isn't my purpose to prove to yoursatisfaction your guilt or that you're goingto be indicted, but--HALDEMAN:It's my purpose to say that the Presidentnow is in possession--PRESIDENT:That I believe you should come-- What areyou going to suggest that he do, John?EHRLICHMAN:Well, if he asks me, what do you want me todo? I am going to say I, if, if you woulddo what I ask you, what I would suggest, youwould pick up the phone or you would allow me to pick it up and call Ear1 Silbert and make an appointment today, and go over, andtalk with the U.S. Attorney about thiscase, with counsel.PRESIDENT:"I'll see the President and tell him you'regoing to do it."EHRLICHMAN:No. PRESIDENT:Okay. EHRLICHMAN:Uh, well you're asking me in effect to godown and enter a guilty plea. And I wouldsay, look John, you're the only one who knows the basic (unintelligible) and todecide whether there's any room between whatyou know and the ultimate action of the jurythrough which you might pass unpunished. Ican't make that judgment for you and I don't have any right to make it for you. All I'm saying is that you're looking at this thingfrom the standpoint of the Presidency.Today is probably the last day that you can take that action, if you're ever going totake it. Uh, do the President a bit ofgood.PRESIDENT:"Do you realize John, uh, that uh, that uh,that uh, uh, uh, (tape noise) on the WhiteHouse? I mean Colson, maybe Haldeman, aregoing to get involved in this thing too."EHRLICHMAN:Well, here again, we're looking at thisthinq not from the standpoint of any otherindividual. We're looking at it from the standpoint of the Presidency and that's the only way I think you and I can approachthis.PRESIDENT:And I'd, I'd go further and say thePresident has said let the chips fall where they may.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:We are not gonna cover for anybody. I thinkyou ought to say that.EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Don't you agree, Bob? That isn't it? We'vea--HALDEMAN:He may go, he may get Chuck. He may get you(unintelligible) to ask him to do(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) on the whole House. Fine.But we on the other hand, have to dosomething else. Fine. I think he would take the latter. He thinks--HALDEMAN:He thinks (unintelligible) and that's thething we've worried about all along, haven'twe. That's uh, if somebody gets hit what will we do. But we can't worry about whatwe will do if he does anything. We'll haveto deal with that. It's gonna expire.EHRLICHMAN:And this is one that will permit him--and itmight help the Presidency, rather thandamage it.PRESIDENT:Uh, Bob, do you think there's something tobe said for having John wait to talk toMagruder until after he's seen Mitchell?(Tape noise) something. Suppose you get stonewalled with Mitchell.HALDEMAN:Well, I think John's in a stronger positionif he's talked to Magruder than if he hasn't, but I, maybe,EHRLICHMAN:I tell you, it is not what Mitchell saysthat matters today. It is the fact that youhave acted on information today.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Now, let's suppose Mitchell turns us downcold, and says I'm going to preserve all my rights. I'm going to make, uh, fight every inch of turf and so on and so forth. Okay.That's that, alright. But at least you,having accumulated all this knowledge this week, have tried to get this thing out, so that sometime two months from now, threemonths from now, a year from now whenthere's an accounting, you can say, "On the 14th of April--PRESIDENT:It's the 13th.EHRLICHMAN:It's where? Uh, on the 14th day or the14th?PRESIDENT:This is the 14th, yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, we had Friday the 13th yesterday.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) the 13th. EHRLICHMAN:On, on the 14th...PRESIDENT:No, seriously (unintelligible) as I havetold both of you, the boil had to be pricked. That's-in a very different sense-- that's what December 18th was about. Wehave to prick the Goddamn boil and take theheat. Now that's what we are doing here. We're going to prick this boil and take theheat. Am I, am I overstating?HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:No, I think that's right. And uh,(unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:The history of this--HALDEMAN:...and this will prick the boil.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:It may not.EHRLICHMAN:The history of this thing has to be, though,that you did not tuck this under the rug...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...yesterday or today, and hope it would goaway. ,PRESIDENT:Now, uh, let me give the scenario -- uh hasEhrlichman go out and tell people that Ihave done this.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know.
