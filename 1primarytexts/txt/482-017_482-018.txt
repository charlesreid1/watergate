[Picks up telephone.]EHRLICHMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:[To telephone operator] Dick Kleindienst. [Hangsup.]EHRLICHMAN:And--PRESIDENT:How long before that [unintelligible] do youexpect a moritorium?EHRLICHMAN:Well, they filed a notice of appeal. IfPRESIDENT:Who did?EHRLICHMAN:we do not file a statement of jurisdiction bytomorrow the case is dead, and, uh,PRESIDENT:who?EHRLICHMAN:uh -- the Justice Department.PRESIDENT:They're not going to file. EHRLICHMAN:Well, I thought that was your position.PRESIDENT:Oh, hell.EHRLICHMAN:I've been trying to give, I've been trying togive them signals on this, and, uh, they've been horsing us pretty steadily. Uh, uh, GeneenPRESIDENT:Statement of Jurisdiction.EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:I don't want to know anything about the case.Don't tell me aEHRLICHMAN:Yeah, I won't. PRESIDENT:thing about it. I don't want to know aboutGeneen. I've met him and I don't know -- I don'tknow whether ITT is bad, good, or indifferent. But there is not going to be any more antitrustactions as long as I am in this chair.EHRLICHMAN:Well, there's one PRESIDENT:God damn it, we're going to stop it. EHRLICHMAN:All right. There's this other one that you aregoing to talk to John about tomorrow on thenetworks.PRESIDENT:Well, I don't want him to do that, for otherreasons.EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's right. This, that's-- PRESIDENT:This is the wrong time EHRLICHMAN:These are all coming togetherPRESIDENT:We wanted to do that at another timeEHRLICHMAN:Okay, but that's all coming together you see atthis point in time, so uh, uh, it's, it's [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Where's I Kleindienst? Isn't he in town?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. He's in his office. I just talked to himabout an hour ago. And, uh--PRESIDENT:Well, we'll take care of it.EHRLICHMAN:Okay. Beyond that, uh-- PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] cut out this damn thing, BobJohn.SHULTZ:In this, uh, talk that I am making speechesPRESIDENT:Yeah, you talking economic, SHULTZ:Yeah,PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] great.SHULTZ:which I quote you with, uh--I'd like e to get youto riffle through it, when I'm done toPRESIDENT:Sure, I will.SHULTZ:see what kind of shape, but there is a section onthe question of is there something new about the economy today. Has business become moremonopolistic, and so on. And I go through thevarious studies of [Telephone buzzes] concentration and the vertical integration andPRESIDENT:[Picks up telephone.] Yeah.Hi, Dick, how are you?Fine, fine. I'm going to talk to John tomorrowabout my general attitude on antitrust, and in the meantime, I know that he has left with you,uh, the IT & T thing because apparently he sayshe had something to do with them once.Well, I have, I have nothing to do with them, andI want something clearly understood, and, if it is not understood, McLaren's ass is to be out within one hour. The IT & T thing -- stay thehell out of it. Is that clear? That's an order.The order is to leave the God damned thing alone.Now, I've said this, Dick, a number of times, andyou fellows apparently don't get the me--, themessage over there. I do not want McLaren to run around prosecuting people,raising hell about conglomerates, stirring thingsup at this point. Now, you keep him the hell outof that. Is that clear?Or either he resigns. I'd rather have him outanyway. I don't like the son-of-a-bitch.The question is, I know, that the jurisdictionknow all the legal things, Dick, you don't have to spell out the legal--That's right.That's right. Don't file the brief. Your --my order is to drop the God damn thing.Is that clear?Okay. [Hangs up.]SHULTZ:Anyway, looking--PRESIDENT:I hope he resigns. He may.SHULTZ:If you look at concentration ratios over a periodof time, on-horizontal integration, if you look at ratios of sales to value added on verticalintegration, what you find is no evidence of anyincrease in, in monopoly in American business. In fact, over a thirty-year period, and I checkedthis over with my friend Stigler who has m made alot of these studies. If anything, you see a decline. And in the conglomerate area is what I think we are witnessing, is, uh, a sort of areaction to the buildup of conglomerates, whichis perhaps affected somewhat by the antitrust. But basically, the market place is taken care of,in a sense that a lot of the firms that acquiredbusinesses that they really didn't know anything about; are finding that they can't run those businesses very well, and they are getting rid ofthem. And, uh, so there is a cleansing processtaking place. And where you have, uh, where you, have a [unintelligible] of conglomerates, I believe, the case can be made, uh, rather readilyin, uh, many, many instances, that they add tothe sharpness, of competition, because they acquire a relatively small firm, they give itmuscle and they send it into, into competitionand make the market work better. At least this is the, this is the general posture that I'm taking in this, uh, talk. I believe that theevidence -- I don't -- I mean I don't--I'm not alawyer and I don't know all of that side of it.EHRLICHMAN:You're not the only one.SHULTZ:From the Standpoint of the economics of it uh Ithink the conglomerates have taken a bum rap.PRESIDENT:This is, this is the problem. The problem isMcLaren's a nice little fellow who's a goodlittle antitrust lawyer out in Chicago. Now hecomes in and all these bright little bastards that worked for the Antitrust Department foryears and years and years and who bate businesswith a passion -- any business -- have taken him over. They haven't taken him over. Then of course McLaren is the man. They go into--Kleindienst is busy appointing judges; Mitchellis busy doing other things, so they're afraid to overrule him. By God they're not going to do it.I mean the point is that on this antitrust theyhad deliberately gone into number of areas which have no relationship with each other, to -- whether it's a question of operating more, moreefficiently than the rest. There's simply aquestion of tactically, they've gone off on a kick, that'll make them big God damn trust busters. That was all right fifty years ago.Fifty years ago maybe it was a good thing for thecountry. It's not a good thing for the country today. That's my views about it, and I am not --We've been, been through this crap. They've doneseveral of them already about -- They have raised holy hell with the people that we, uh, uh -- Well, Geneen, hell, he's no contributor.He's nothing to us. I don't care about him. Soyou can I've only met him once, twice -- uh, we've, I'm just, uh -- I can't understand what the trouble is.EHRLICHMAN:Well,PRESIDENT:It's McLaren, isn't it? EHRLICHMAN:McLaren has a very strong sense of mission here.PRESIDENT:Good -- Jesus, he's Get him out. In one hour,EHRLICHMAN:He's got a PRESIDENT:one hour. EHRLICHMAN:very strong--PRESIDENT:And he's not going to be a judge, either. He isout of the God damn government. You know, just like that regional. office man in, in, in SanFrancisco. I put an order into Haldeman todaythat he be fired today.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Today. Anybody that didn't follow what we'vedone per the latest'd have his ass out. Unlesshe is a, What Is he, is he a Republican hack or something?EHRLICHMAN:No, I don't even know who he is.PRESIDENT:How could heI mean, that's ridiculous that hewent through there with oneEHRLICHMAN:Five--PRESIDENT:applications out of four thousand He didn'tfollow what we said. To hell with him. We've got to be a little bit more effective here. You're not going to [unintelligible]. Oh, I knowwhat McLaren is, he believes this.EHRLICHMAN:yeah. PRESIDENT:I know. Who the hellhe wasn't elected[unintelligible]EHRLICHMAN:That's the point PRESIDENT:He is here by sufferance, EHRLICHMAN:That's the point.PRESIDENT:And he is not going to stay one, uh, anotherminute. Not a minute. Because he's going after everybody, you know, just -- Why the hell doesn'the go after somebody that, uhEHRLICHMAN:[Laughs] That's been suggested. PRESIDENT:Oh. EHRLICHMAN:Your, uh, your television sense is apparentlypretty good. They, uh, you know, we got, uh, anarcotics show on.PRESIDENT:Did you? EHRLICHMAN:Uh, called "O&#8482;Hara - The United States Treasury,&#64258;and it had a hell of a rating its first, uh, itsfirst time--PRESIDENT:&#64257;O'Hara&#64258; was it called?EHRLICHMAN:It was called: "O'Hara, The United StatesTreasury.&#64258;PRESIDENT:I saw it.EHRLICHMAN:They, they sent it over. PRESIDENT:I saw it. EHRLICHMAN:Is it any good? It got a, it got a twenty-eight,uh, in seventy cities, uh, on its Neilson, soit's, it's apparently pretty popular. [Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Hm.EHRLICHMAN:So, uh-- PRESIDENT:You know, all of those spy shows get great thingyou knowEHRICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Well, anyway -- It was a good show. It was a,like all those things. My God, they had, uh,they had guys chasing, chasing people with, uh,airplanes and all that sort of thing. I don't think it quite worked that way, but, at least they still can [unintelligible] bring the stuffin.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:And it's fascinating EHRLICHMAN:Well, it's a thirteen week series, it opened up.PRESIDENT:YeahEHRLICHMAN:Be going on now PRESIDENT:Right. YeahEHRLICHMAN:Uh, you asked for a PR plan on crime. The, uh--PRESIDENT:Get any cooperation?EHRLICHMAN:Well, uh, we've got our boys working on it. Itis going to take a little time, 'cause we're shifting into another phase on this whole thingnow.PRESIDENT:What's the crime now? EHRLICHMAN:Well, crime statistics are going to start runningagainst us regardless of--PRESIDENT:We can do, because --? EHRLICHMAN:-- because of the entry of more and more kidsinto that what is it, fifteen to, fifteen totwenty age bracket. They expect that burglariesand robberies, for instance, are going to go up thirty per cent in the next few years, just fromthe number of fifteen to twenty-four year oldsthat are going to increase. They're going to have that many more, so just statistically, the probabilitiesPRESIDENT:Well, what if you can't do anything about it?EHRLICHMAN:Well, we can't on that, probably, but there are alot of other things that we can do and we're trying to gin up a bunch of stuff on otheraspects of crime that we can get into, other thanPRESIDENT:How about turning to this, if the mugging, if themugging [unintelligible]EHRLICHMAN:We're still, we're still doing pretty well there,Mr. President.PRESIDENT:Let&#8482;s try to knock that down. That&#8482;s where wehad a responsibility,EHRLICHMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:and then blame the states for failing-to knockthis down.EHRLICHMAN:We can, we can do that. We can do that. PRESIDENT:All right.EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, we've been, been working with Wilson- onsome more things that we could do here. But, uh, uh, George and I have been talking a little bit about our District of Columbia situation, and,we're going to have to, we're going to have to besure that our management of that is, is very tight, 'cause the only way that we get theseresults is by just really keeping on top of theseguys every day.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Who is, uh-- EHRLICHMAN:So, anywayPRESIDENT:Who's in charge?EHRLICHMAN:It'll be [unintelligible] and there will be some[unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Who's in charge in the district. Mayor?EHRLICHMAN:Nathan. Right. Now, then, in to the Mayor, uh,Watt, the Deputy Mayor, who is kind of [unintelligible] and to the Chief of Police.Klein's moved each one of those fellowsseparately, and we, we, work on each one of them differently.PRESIDENT:It can be done here in the District, and I thinkwe could settle it.EHRLICHMAN:Our PR campaign itself -- that's going to take alittle more time than had been allowed[unintelligible] bear with us a little bit moreand so--PRESIDENT:Well, we're going after drugs. We just want tobe sure that we, uh,EHRLICHMAN:--show that the-- PRESIDENT:show the radicals something--you doing something,John.EHRLICEMAN:Well, the Mafia, the organized crime thing, weshow quite a lot of action. Bombing things,PRESIDENT:GoodEHRLICILMAN:we'll get a break in the Capitol bombing case oneof these daysPRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:They think they know who did that. This&#352;PRESIDENT:What -- is the Grand Jury cranking out one count,or what?EHRLICHMAN:it's the same, uh, PRESIDENT:Weathermen?ERRLICHMAN:Bernadette Dome, uh, Renne Davis bunch.PRESIDENT:Good.EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, they&#8482;ve got an informant, and they&#8482;reworking on it, and they&#8482;re beginning to develop their lines on that. The, uh, they&#8482;re about to bust the, uh, FBI burglary of that branch office,and, that comes all back to the Berrigan crowd.PRESIDENT:Oh, uh, oh, is that it? EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:That'd be terrible.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. And, uh, they-- PRESIDENT:They brought one on us? EHRLICHMAN:They brought a reindictment. All that Berriganbunch, the co-conspir--, conspirators, on abroader, on a broader indictment basis, uh, that has to do with, uh, subverting the wholeselective service system. And, each one of theseburglaries, and each one of these destruction of files and all that, fits within the larger context. So, we are going through another grandjury proceeding right now on that. There will bequite a lot activity on, on, that kind of extreme violence front. Even though the street crime thing is not going to show up very well. We'regoing to have to put our accent where we can.The prison thing, the court reform thing, and those other things that are really significant,but are less sexy, we'll continue to push alongon. And, there are some things we can do there.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] others in this if we can.EHRLICHMAN:Well, we -- the kind of thing we were talkingabout where you, where you visit this, this, uh,PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICILHAN:this facility and, uh, some of those things beginto point at some of these areas -- your interestin them and, and, uh, so on. We'll be coming at you with a program. On suburban housing, uh,Supreme Court decided the case the other day,called the Lackawanna case -- Lackawanna, New York -- that's a case where the, where the Court found as a matter of fact that the zoning restedon a racially discriminatory basis; struck thezoning down.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICILHAN:Uh, I think there's enough in that decision, thatyou can say: Okay, we now know what the law is -- the Supreme Court decision -- we now know what the law is. So, we are going to enforce the lawand that's going to take care of all theseassociated problems here.PRESIDENT:What does it do again? EHRLICHMAN:Well, it, uh, in effect it announces the law,with regard to racial discrimination, in thelocation of housing proj--, Fed--, Federally assisted housing projects.PRESIDENT:And, and, says what?EHRLICHMAN:Says that the trier of fact will determinewhether or not there was a racial motivation from the exclusion of this. If he finds that there was, it's illegal; if he finds there wasn't, thenit isn't. And so this comes down to a questionof fact in each case, for the, for the Court -- for the trier of fact. The Court is the properforum for this. Not the administrative officerin HUD. So it--I think we can make something that will be along the lines of your, your basic thinking on thisPRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] comes down the middle in cases.EHRLICHMAN:Well, it isn't down the middle. It, it, what itsays is, that every one of these is a separatecase to be decided on it'sPRESIDENT:So you don't-- EHRLICHMAN:own facts by the Court. PRESIDENT:You don't have, then, a national--EHRLICHMAN:You don't have national decisions done on themilitary basis of the Department of Housing and HEW.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] the Black Jack case, or not?EHRLICHMAN:Well, it says the Black Jack case ought to belitigated, and uh--All of these cases ought to be litigated.PRESIDENT:The Supreme Court--EHRLICHMAN:InS--, Supreme Court denied certiorari. PRESIDENT:Have you told John, uh, -- does Romney know this?EHRLICHMAN:Well, he knows the case came down, sure.PRESIDENT:Does he understand it? EHRLICHMAN:I think so. I think he does. But I've heldeverybody off pretty much, and said thatPRESIDENT:Good.EHRLICHMAN:This thing is now in process. PRESIDENT:That's where it ought to be.EHRLICHMAN:And, we're, we're just holding it there. But, Igot to make a trip west--PRESIDENT:What's the size of the opinion, opinion? Was it,uh, unanimous?EHRLICHMAN:Uh.PRESIDENT:Did they just deny certiorari? EHRLICHMAN:Denied certiorari. So we don't know. TheCircuit Court was a very strong opinion. And,uh, uh, I think, uh, probably it's good law, by and large.PRESIDENT:The Court finally decided not to get into this.EHRLICHMAN:Yes, at least--PRESIDENT:That's good. EHRLICHMAN:Uh, now, about the first of next week, PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:uh, we're going to be in shape to start draftinga policy statement on this, if you wish. Uh, the other thing we could do is simply make anannouncement, that,as far as the Black Jack case itself isconcerned, in view of the Lackawanna case, and some of these other considerations,PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:uh, we are going to, we're going to take theposition that, the party should litigate these without the intervention of the DepartmentPRESIDENT:That's right. That's better.EBRLICHMAN:of Justice. PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s better. The main point is that--keep usout of it, if you can. I mean it's, uh, it's,uh, a can of worms. No way you can--I, I prefera different course--EHRLICHMAN:Once you did -- but, but, then the question is:Does the Department of Justice intervenePRESIDENT:No. EHRLICIMAN:in all these cases, you see? Once you start that, PRESIDENT:No. No.EBRUCIMAN:uh, see, you've got a, you got a kind of a blankcheck.PRESIDENT:You [unintelligible] Leonard Garment who I'dnever [unintelligible] but--EHRLICHMAN:[Laughs] You&#8482;d be in every damn case.PRESIDENT:You&#8482;d be eager to&#352; EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, so, uh, what we try and do is begin todraft, uh, a concise statementPRESIDENT:A concise statement&#352;EHRLICMAN:that, uh, [unintelligible] PRESIDENT:it's, it's [unintelligible]. Waffles it and getsout of it.EHMACOUN:Well, we're not going to be permitted a very goodwaffle, I am afraid. Uh, it's going to be subject to tremendous scrutiny. But, uh,PRESIDENT:All right.EHRLICIMAN:we'll try to make it as tight as we can, andindicate why it isPRESIDENT:Good.EHRLICHMAN:that the Federal Government cannot be interveningin every way.PRESIDENT:Yeah. One of the reasons, George, that you gotto act on that SBA guy--I don't care if he's akid with eight--a guy with eighteen kids--is that we have no disciplinein this bureaucracy. We never fire anybody. Wenever reprimand anybody. We never demote anybody. We always promote the sons-of-bitches that kick us in the ass. That's true in theState Department. It's true in HEW. It's truein OMB, and true for ourselves, and it's got to stop. This fellow deliberately did not -- I readthe memorandum -- he did not carry out an order Ipersonally gave. I wrote the order out [unintelligible]. And, the son-of-a-bitch did not do it. Now, I don't care what he is. Gethim out of there. Get him out of San Francisco,if he's, he's -- the head is got to roll. I'd roll Kleppe's if it weren't for the fact that Iknow that Kleppe wasn't in there long enough toknow where the toilet was. But this guy, in San Francisco, was the head of the Office. He was incompetent. I'm sure it wasn't deliberate. Hewas either incompetent or deliberately justdidn't do it. So -- but, the main point is, and I like, as I told Haldeman, it's got to be done with publicity. And, let him roll. So that --as a warning to a few other people around in thisGovernment, that we are going to quit being a bunch of God damn soft-headed managers. I reallythink you got to do it.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:You&#8482;ve got to do it. That is the trouble withMcLaren. McLaren thinks he&#8482;s going to do everything. To hell with him. I mean, we, we&#8482;re willing to go along with it, but he cannotdeliberately just thumb his nose at everythingthat comes from this office, John. He is not that big, and of course, if John Mitchell won&#8482;tstand up to him, I will. I don&#8482;t want to, butI&#8482;ll have to. We are not going to have it. All that they have to do in this case&#352;I know what the procedure is&#352;is that the Justice Departmentdecides whether or not it&#8482;s going to continue tofight the case. Isn&#8482;t that what it is?EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:Then -- well, God damn it, they lost the casebefore. Lose it. Lose it for once. They fought the good fight, and they lost. And, let the little bastards work on something else. Work onthe study that you've asked them to send us.That would be very good.EHRLICHMAN:That would be done here. PRESIDENT:I'll say. You've got to get us some discipline,George. You've got to get it, and the only wayyou get it, is when a bureaucrat deliberately thumbs his nose, we're going to get him. Nownext year, we're going to getthis -- that time, after time, after time andagain. The little boys over in State particularly, that are against us, will do it. Defense, HEW -- those three areas particularly.They've got to know, that if they do it,something's going to happen to them. Where anything can happen. I know the Civil Servicepressure. But, you can do a lot there, too.There are many unpleasant places where Civil Service people can be sent. We just don't have any discipline in government. That's ourtrouble, Now, I'm getting a little around theWhite House, uh, but we got to get it in these departments. That should not have happened.That was a terrible thing. One hundred and fiveapplications processed out of four thousand in four months, three months or whatever it was -- two months. God damn it, that's terrible. Allat the time of his, his [unintelligible]. So,whatever you -- well, maybe he is in the Regional Office. Fine. Demote him, or send him to the, send him to the Guam Regional Office. There's away. Get him the hell out.EHRLICHMAN:You're going to have a revenue sharing hearingstarting on Friday.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Or rural revenue sharing. PRESIDENT:YeahEHRLICHMAN:Uh, we talked sometime ago about&#352;PRESIDENT:Rural revenue sharing. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:It comes up as a result of, of some hearing takento the Senate. [Unintelligible] subject to economic development in the nation was shiftedover to this, as I understand it. We talkedabout John Connally being a, sort of the Administration admiral on this.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, this would be a place for him to sort of kickit off, and, uh, if you have no objection, I'd like to get him briefed up and, and, lined up togo in on this, in stead of just Cliff Hardin.Because I am afraid, if, if, we lead offPRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] EHRLICIHMAN:weakly, uhI think that Hardin will have tobe in it, but, uh--PRESIDENT:I know, but he--EHRLICHMAN:To get the thing off on the right foot, I&#8482;d liketo, I&#8482;d like to start with Connally on these.PRESIDENT:Well, if he&#8482;s willing. EHRLICHMAN:Okay.PRESIDENT:I mean, we, we want to remember there&#8482;s a biggun: don't want to pop it too often.EHRLICHMAN:Oh no, no, but it'll--PRESIDENT:It'll waste it.EHRLICHMAN:This is a, this is one that everybody's going tobe watching, in effect.PRESIDENT:Really?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I, I have to assume so. It's, uh, it'll bethe first,PRESIDENT:What about general revenue sharing?EHRLICHMAN:be the first consideration you see and we won'tget to general revenue sharing in Ways and Means for another, oh, I guess six weeks probably, isn't it George?SHULTZ:Something like that. It could be before that,and as I suppose Somewhat--I don't know whether or not we can work out anythingwith Mills. And have you had a chance to look atthe various formulas that Harper and, uh, O&#8482;Neil-EHRLICHMAN:Uh, I haven&#8482;t been able to talk to him about it,though, &#8218;cause I don&#8482;t understand it all.PRESIDENT:That happens for tomorrow.EHRLICHMAN:It, it just seems to me with that the firsthearing on the subject, that we would be wise toget Connally to put it in context.PRESIDENT:How does it look? EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, uh, I think it looks better now than itdid because we gave them an extension business.AndPRESIDENT:This is reorganization. Oh, is this the new[unintelligible]EHRLICHMAN:[Unintelligible]. Oh yes.PRESIDENT:That had to do EHRLICHMAN:That had to do with revenue sharing. SHULTZ:Both, well, both &#338; [clears throat]PRESIDENT:Oh, I see it. Uh, uh, a maintenance of thatagreement rather than [unintelligible] I see. [Unintelligible] I see.EHRLICHMAN:So that would be the facts of the particular--PRESIDENT:well, [unintelligible] would be great to do it,then, if he would.SHULTZ:All right. We'll see if we can--PRESIDENT:He knows that,EHRLICHMAN:He is coming over this, afternoon to talk aboutit.PRESIDIENT:he knows that part of the country and he knowsthe farmers, and he knows -- uh, sort of kick off the reorganization and everything. He'd be an excellent guy to make the presentation, if he iswilling. Well, also, assure him that we're not[laughs] going to send him up there every week.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:'Cause that's not right. It's going to, it's awaste of a good property. And you only can use him, you know, and I don't, I don't want that hauling him up there, wasting his time.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] whether we've got anything morewe can move revenue sharing, and -- How did you get along with Mills, or, do you know him?SHULTZ:I haven't been back to him since the, last timewe talked because we are trying to, to see what kind of a proposal we can get up and what, how different formulas work, and how they affect thevarious states and so forthPRESIDENT:Well-- SHULTZ:So, I haven't done, wanted him to--PRESIDENT:You mean he'd desire to move the thing?SHULTZ:He&#8482;ll EHRLICHMAN:[Unintelligible] his staff worked on it. PRESIDENT:Oh, I see.EHRLICHMAN:Which is not done.PRESIDENT:I&#8482;ve argued where he is waiting for us to presentto him--SHULTZ:The last time I talked to him, I just describedthe, the general approach, and, uh, we talked about it, and he, he, uh, liked it. So, I said, well, I would work on it some more. And I&#8482;d talkto you about it. And, uh, said I didn't knowwhether you would buy this kind of thing or not. But anyway, uh, this was a, uh, this was a, uh, this was an effort to try to see if there wasn'tsome common ground, and that, uh, we'd try to,uh, develop some thing a little bit more specific so we can see how itaffects this state and that state and so on.PRESIDENT:George, look here. Isn't really the case this:[Unintelligible) Mills or Byrnes or anybody else ever come up with anything else of their ownthinking? Right up--SHULTZ:Really, nothing. PRESIDENT:Isn't that true? Well then, really, really, uh,we just got to press ours. I mean, if theirs, ifthat's the case [unintelligible] and, uh, and who's, who -- if anybody's got a better thing, let's take it.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, Byrnes is sort of hipped on tax credits.PRESIDENT:Oh, God. EHRLICHMAN:I talked to Mel Laird at some length, uh, lastweek about, uh, our problem with Byrnes--PRESIDENT:Yeah, he knows him well. EHRLICHMAN:And, he is going to talk to him over the weekend,and see if he couldPRESIDENT:Hm.EHRLICHMAN:midwife some accommodation on this, PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:uh, so, uh, I expect to hear from Mel today.PRESIDENT:Byrnes, you see, really plays into the hands ofthe, our political opponents here by sort of talking away&#352;which is, all it does is simply &#338;itraises an issue. Of course, he isn&#8482;t going toget tax credit, so, therefore by raising&#352;all he does is to stop our program and give them achance to say: well, program isn't even begun.EHRLICHMAN:He is causing great confusion among theRepublicans on Ways and Means,PRESIDENT:Is he?EHRLICHMAN:because he, he's not showing any leadership, and,uh, he's giving them an anti- Administration signal without any place to go.PRESIDENT:Isn't that great?EHRLICHMAN:And so, uh, Mel is going to talk to him in thoseterms, and see if--PRESIDENT:Mel said he would? Do you think Mel will?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. I believe so; I believe so. See, wehopped over there in response to his remark to you, where he said, you know, revenue sharing wasn't floating. So,Mel said he would. He said that to you one day.I am sure you sent him a memo and, and we arrived in force and uh, and, uh, sat down with him and said: Okay, what&#8482;s wrong with it? What can we dobetter? Where were we wrong, - and this and thatand kind of caught him -- [laughs) would, you know, had to put up or shut up for this and, andso, we then got into a discussion about theCommittee problems, which is his strong suit. And, he quickly sorted it out and said, &#64257;Well, I think John Byrnes is the key to this. He'sprobably not going to run for re-election. He'sbeing very independent with this Congress. Uh, about the only way,&#64258; he says, &#64257;we can work thisis for me to talk to him.&#64258; So, he says, "I'lltalk to him over the weekend, and I'll be in touch with you.&#64258; What we'll build toward, if we can, is a meeting with all the Republicans on theCommittee, to just talk out the issues, to talkabout the alternatives, weigh them and go into the detail with them, and ask them to spend an afternoon with us. And, uh, then, uh, see at theend of that whether we don't at least have therest of the Republicans with us, even if we can't get Byrnes. Maybe they can bring him along withthe House vote. So, that's kind of our strategynow, on that side. [Unintelligible] these guys to bear on the merits, I think we can solve a lotPRESIDENT:Yeah. Right.EHRLICHMAN:of our problems. But it's just-- PRESIDENT:Well, it's basicallyThey've been--On themerits it's really a question of theirtheydon't have anything better, but, they thereforeare always unsure of being for anything. That's our problem. It's new; it's new, and uh,extremely complicated.SHULTZI would, I would say that Mills' readiness toagree to the sort of thing we talked about is pretty clear indication that he seesPRESIDENT:Yeah.SHULTZ:that something has to be done about the area.Because by the time you,PRESIDENT:Yeah.SHULTZ:you say all right, we're going to have astatement of purpose, and it's going to be as broad as all outdoors, and he accepts that, wellthat's, that's just accepting general revenuesharing. Whether the formulations that do more in the direction, of, of need can be worked out satisfactorily I don't know. But, uh, that's theother thing that he, he, uh, talks about.PRESIDENT:George, can't we make a deal? Uh, the main thingis to get it done- And, we have to concede, but we may concede--don't want to concede too soon, but--EHRLICHMAN:I've got the medical thing- in the next day ortwo, and like the health thing, and maybe Gerry Ford with him.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] try. Okay.SHULTZ:I talked to Byrnes about this, as well as Mills.Byrnes is not as, uh, enthusiastic about it as Mills is. Byrnes is just -- He's very difficultto, uh, he's sort of giving him, uh, a compromisethat would get him off the hook and he won't take it. He keeps on the tax credit idea.PRESIDENT:Gee, that's awfully ir--, irresponsible. I mean,uh, well -- and, uh, this, this grave business on the -- It's the principle. If he doesn't want to do it, God damn it, then the second man on theCommittee to help him [unintelligible]EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's it. If he, if he-- PRESIDENT:Who is [unintelligible]? Who's next? EHRLICHMAN:That's, uh, Betts.PRESIDENT:Will Betts do it?EHRLICHMAN:Betts is the guy who's out speaking up and downthe land for us. We got him very firmly aboard.'PRESIDENT:[Sighs] Oh, in that case-- BULL:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:How many have you got? About fifteen?BULL:Uh, the number is, uh, seventeen. EHRLICHMAN:Seventeen--PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] sees them. That's nice. Okay.[Unintelligible]SHULTZ:Alan Wallace is apparently coming in Sun--Saturday.PRESIDENT:Well, they set up, uh -- it seemed at the time, Isuppose, a good idea. They set up some sort of a foundation, and, uh, thatSHULTZ:Yeah. I know.PRESIDENT:teach teachers to teach, to do the two partysystem. That's a silly damn thing, you know, the two party system, but nevertheless they're allmishatched, and so, I got a great[unintelligible]. They're nice people, and they're all our friends. Bob [unintelligible]. You get that guy fired, George, in San Francisco.Get him out of there. And by&#352;-I want it all, I wantit to ricochet all around the EOB, and I want it to ricochet all around HEW. And let people know that when they don't produce in thisAdministration, somebody's ass is kicked out.This will be the first person we've fired except Hickel. Now, God damn it, those are the badguys--the guys down in the woodwork. We betterget one. This guy goes. He's out. Fast.BULL:Mr. President, Mrs. [unintelligible] willintroduce these new people to you. It'llonly--We're going to have a press conference onthis, so only four people you, and Senator Taft [unintelligible] and Mrs. [unintelligible] willbe in the picture.
