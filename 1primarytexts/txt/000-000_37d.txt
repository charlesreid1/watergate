KALMBACH:I'm, I'm pretty good.EHRLICHMAN:Good.KALMBACH:I'm, I'm, uh, scheduled for two tomorrowafternoon.EHRLICHMAN:Where, at the jury or the U.S. Attorney?KALMBACH:At the jury.EHRLICHMAN:Uh-huh. KALMBACH:...and I'm scheduled at 5:30 this afternoonwith, uh, with Silbert.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, are ya? KALMBACH:Yeah. I uh, just wanted to run through quickly EHRLICHMAN:Sure.KALMBACH:...several things, John, in line with ourconversation. I, I uh, got in here and, uh, last night and there's a telephone call from O'Brien. I returned it and went over theretoday. And uh, he said the reason that was--for the call-- was La Rue had told him that to ask him to call me to say that he'd had toidentify me...EHRLICHMAN:Uh--hm KALMBACH:...in connection with this, and, uh, and hewanted me to know that, and so on.EHRLICHMAN:Did he tell you about Dean?APRIL 19, 19732KALMBACH:No.EHRLICHMAN:Well, Dean has, uh, totally cooperated withthe U.S. Attorney in the hopes of gettingimmunity.KALMBACH:Um hum.EHRLICHMAN:Now what he says, or how he says it, nobodyseems to be able to divine.KALMBACH:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:But he's...KALMBACH:The whole enchilada?EHRLICHMAN:He's throwing off on Bob and me heavily. KALMBACH:He is?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.KALMBACH:He is? EHRLICHMAN:And taking the position that he was a mereagent.KALMBACH:Um hum.EHRLICHMAN:Now, on your episode... KALMBACH:Yes, sir. EHRLICHMAN:...he told me before he left, so to speak, --he, Dean--told me that really my transactionwith him involving you was virtually my only area of liability in this thing. And I said,"Well John, what in the world are you talkingabout?" He said, "Well I came to you for Mitchell and I said, uh, Mitchell needs money. Uh, could we call Herb Kalmbach and ask him toraise some?" And I said--and, and, Dea-- saysto me--and you said yes.APRIL 19, 19733EHRLICHMAN:And I said, "Yes, that's right."And he said,(CONT.)"Well, that does it." And I said, "Well,that's hard for me to believe. I don'tunderstand the lawKALMBACH:Um hum.EHRLICHMAN:"...but I don't think Herb entered into thiswith any guilty intent...KALMBACH:I know EHRLICHMAN:"...and I, I certainly didn't." And so I said,"I just find that hard to imagine." Now sincethen I have retained counsel.KALMBACH:Oh, you have?EHRLICHMAN:Who is very good and who agrees with me thatit is the remotest kind of nonsense.KALMBACH:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:But uh, the, the, point that I think has to beclarified, that I'm going to clarify if I geta chance, is that the reason that Dean had to come to me and to Bob where you were concerned is that we had promised you that you would notbe run pillar to post by Maury Stans.KALMBACH:And also, and, and also that you knew -- I wasyour friend--and you knew I was thePresident's attorneyEHRLICHMAN:Sure. KALMBACH:...and never do anything improper EHRLICHMAN:Sure.KALMBACH:...illegal, unethical, or whatever.EHRLICHMAN:Right. KALMBACH:And uh ...APRIL 19, 19734EHRLICHMAN:But the, the point is that rather thanMitchell calling you direct, Mitchell knew darn well that you were no longer available.KALMBACH:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Now this was post-April 6th, was it not? KALMBACH:Yeah.EHRLCHMAN:Yeah.KALMBACH:April 7th. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. So that, uh, Mitchell and Stans bothknew that there wasn't any point in theircalling you direct because we had gotten youout of that on the pretext that, uh, you were going to do things for us.KALMBACH:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And so, uh, uh, it was necessary for Dean tocome to me and then in turn to Bob, and, and plead a very urgent case without reallygetting into any specifics, except to say youhave to trust me, this is very important. And, uh, Mitchell is up his tree, or you know, I mean is really worked up" he didn't. use thatphrase--"but is, is really exercised aboutthis."KALMBACH:Um hum.EHRLICHMAN:I said, "Well, John, if you tell me it's thatimportant, why yes."KALMBACH:You know when you and I, when you and Italked, and it was after John had given methat, that word, and I came in to say--askyou, uh, "John, is this an assignment I have to take on", and you said, "Yes, it is." Uh,period. And uh...EHRLICHMAN:Um hum.APRIL 19, 19735KALMBACH:...go forward. Then that was all that I neededto be assured that I wasn't putting my family in jeopardy.EHRLICHMAN:Sure.KALMBACH:And I would, I would just understand that, uh,you and I are absolutely together on that.EHRLICHMAN:No question about it, uh, Herb, that I wouldnever knowingly have put you in any kind of a spot.KALMBACH:Yeah. Well, and when you and--when we talked,you knew what I was about to do, you know--togo out and get some dough for this purpose. I mean the humanitarian andEHRLICHMAN:Exactly.KALMBACH:And uh... EHRLICHMAN:It was a defense fund. KALMBACH:...and a defense fund.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, Yeah.KALMBACH:...and to, to, to support the families. EHRLICHMAN:That's it. KALMBACH:Now, uh, the thing that was disquieting aboutthis thing with, uh, with O'Brien was that,uh, he said," there is a massive campaign evidently underway to indict all the lawyers,including, including you, Herb." And I justwas a little shocked atEHRLICHMAN:Mmm. KALMBACH:...that. And I guess what, what I need to getfrom you, John, is assurance that this is nottrue.APRIL 19, 19736EHRLICHMAN:Well, I don't know of any attempt to targetyou at all.KALMBACH:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:My hunch is that they're trying to get at me.The're trying to corroborate. See, what they've said to Dean is that he gets noconsideration from them unless they cancorroborate Haldeman and my liability.KAUMBACH:God, if I, I can just make it plain that uh,the--it was the humanitarian and no nothingelse.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. And, and the point, uh, uh&#352;that Iundoubtedly never expressed to you-that Icontinually operated on the basis of Dean'srepresentations to me.KALMBACH: Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:And I had the, uhKALMBACH:It was not improper.EHRLICHMAN:Right. KALMBACH:And there, uh, was nothing illegal about it., EHRLICHMAN:Right. See he's the house lawyer.KALMBACH:Yup. Exactly. And I just couldn't believein--you would--you and Bob and the President's just too good, too good friends to ever put mein the position where I'm putting my family onthe line.EHRLICHMAN:Why of course. KALMBACH:And, uh, it's, it's just unbelievable,un--unthinkable. Now, uh, shall I just-I'lljust, uh--if I'm asked by this Silbert, I'll just lay it out just exactly that way.APRIL 19, 19737EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. I wouldn't haul the President into it...KALMBACH:Oh, no, no, no EHRLICHMAN:If you can help it.KALMBACH:I will not. No.EHRLICHMAN:But uh, I think the point that uh,uh&#352;which Iwill make in the future, uh--if I'm given thechance that, uh, you are not under ourcontrol in any sort of a slavery sense...KALMBACH:No, but EHRLICHMAN:... but that we had agreed that, ah,you wouldnot be at the beck and call of the Committee.KALMBACH:And, and, of course too, that I respond onlyon orders and, you know, on direction, and uh,if this is something that you feltsufficiently important and, uh, that-you were, that you were as-,as-, assured was altogether proper, then I would take it on because Ialways do it, and always have. And you and Boband the President know that.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Well, uh, uh, as far as propriety isconcerned, I think we both were relyingentirely on Dean.KALMBACH:Yep. EHRLTCHMAN:I made no independent judgment...KALMBACH:Yep. Yep.EHRLICHMAN:And I am sure Bob didn't either.APRIL 19, 19738KALMBACH:No. And, I just--I'm just--I just have thefeeling, John that, it, uh&#352;I don't know whether this is a weak reed.Is it?EHRLICHMAN:For who, Dean?KALMBACH:No. I mean this--for--I mean are they stillgoing to say, "Well, Herb, you should haveknown?"EHRLICHMAN:I don't know how you could. You, you didn'tmake any inquiries.KALMBACH:Never. And the only inquiries I made,John, wasto youEHRLICHMAN:Yeah. KALMBACH:after, after I talked to, to John Dean.EHRLICHMAN:And you found that I didn't know just a wholehell of a lot.KALMBACH:Yes, but you said this is something T,I haveto do, and IEHRLICHMAN:Well, yeah. And the reason that I said that,as you know, was not from any I personal inquiry, but was on the basis of, uh what had been represented to me.KALMBACH:Yeah. And, and to, uh provide the defense fundand to, to take care of the families of these fellows who were, uh, thenEHRLICHMAN:Indigent.KALMBACH:...who had not then been found neither quiltyor not guilty.EHRLICHMAN:But, and the point being here, withoutattempting them--to induce them to do a damnthing.KALMBACH:Absolutely not. And that was never&#352;that wasexactly right.APRIL 19, 19739EHRLICHMAN:Okay.KALMBACH:Now, can I, can I get in to see you tomorrowbefore I go in there at two?EHRLICHMAN:If you want to. Now they'll, they'll ask you. KALMBACH:Will they?EHRLICHMAN:Yep.KALMBACH:Well, maybe I sho-, maybe I shouldn't. EHRLICHMM:They'll ask you to whom you've spoken aboutyour testimony. And I would appreciate it ifyou would say that you talked to me inCalifornia, because at that time, I was investigating this thing for the President.KALMBACH:And not now?EHRLICHMAN: Uh, well, I wouldn't ask you to lie KALMBACH:No, I know EHRLICHMAN:Uh, but the point is&#8211;KALMBACH:Not --- but the testimony was in California?EHRLICHMAN:The point is --- well, no. I mean yourrecollection of, of, facts and so forth?KALMBACH:Yes, I agree.EHRLICHMAN:See, uh, uh, I don't think we were ever seentogether out there, but, but at some point I am going to have to say that I talked toO'Brien and Dean and, uh, Magruder andMitchell and you, and a whole lot of people about this case.KALMBACH:Yeah.APRIL 19, 197310EHRLICHMAN:And so, uh, uh, uh, it, it would be consistentKALMBACH:Now,--do you, do you feel, John--calling a bigshot here -- do you, do you feel, assured,as you did when, when we were out there that,that there's no culpability here?EHRLICHMAN:Yes.KALMBACH:And nothing to worry aboutEHRLTCHMAN:And Herb, from everything I hear, they're notafter you.KALMBACH:Yes, sir.EHRLICHMAN:From everything I hear&#8211;.KALMBACH:Well, I (unintelligible) Barbara, you know, IjustEHRLICHMAN:They're out to get me and they're out to getBob.KALMBACH:My God. All right. Well, John, I'll-it'll beabsolutely clear that there was no -- therewas nothing, uh, looking towards any cover-upor anything.EHRLICHMAN:Right. KALMBACH:It was just strictly from humanitarian and,uh,and I just wanted you, I just&#352;when I talked toyou--I just wanted you to advise me that it was all right on that, on that basisEHRLICHMAN:On that basis.KALMBACH:to go forward. EHRLICHMAN: That it was necessary...APRIL 19, 197311KALMBACH:And that will be precisely the way it is.EHRLICHAMAN:Okay.KALMBACH:Alright.EHRLICHAMAN:Thanks, Herb. KALMBACH:Okay.EHRLICHMAN:Bye - bye.
