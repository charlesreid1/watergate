TRANSCRIPT OF A RECORDING OF AMEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTAND JOHN EHRLICHMAN ON APRIL 19,1973, FROM 1:03 p.m., TO 1:30 p.m.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 TO 1:30 P.M.11PRESIDENT:Was it?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. And, you'll remember our responseto that was, you cannot defend blackmail, in that kind of a situation.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And that's all that is, is pure blackmail.PRESIDENT:Huh. EHRLICHMAN:And we said, "No dice." and I could be justas flat out on that as that's the honest toGod truth.*********** PRESIDENT:Now let me put, put one other question toyou right. Very painful, I know it's verypainful for you to think of this, and it is for me too, but anyway, but, uhh, I think it would be helpful if you had thisconsideration when you talk the rest of theday, this and that, bother you the rest of the day I hope. I think the separationproblem has to be considered. I want you tolook at it very coldly, not in terms of Bob, in terms of the President, the needs that we have and have had, and an atmosphere, Mr. Soand So, look at this thing, in terms ofyour, about how you're involved in terms of whether it's going to be bad, and what, howyou are involved, what Dean may say. Don'tknow what The son-of-a-bitch is going to say. I don't know what you do with the Dean (unintelligible) he's obviously very upset.He's just lashing out. Goddammit, I don'tknow what we've been told. I just don't know, John. Frankly, I'm at a loss. Wewere all talking frankly, that's why thecounsel was sworn.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.12EHRLICHMAN:Well, as I said...PRESIDENT:That goddamn Dean.EHRLICHMAN:As I said this morning, I think you can verytruthfully and logically and properly say that ...PRESIDENT:I was trying to bury, I was trying, I wasreally trying to probe his thought processes. I went down every road we possibly could...EHRLICHMAN:Exactly right.PRESIDENT:...and see where we were. EHRLICHMAN:And it paid off. You see, you're the onewho then came back and said, "I've go tohave that all written down. Send that man to Camp David if necessary and have him take as much time as necessary and let's get itall down." That's when he was uncovered.PRESIDENT:I suppose that really isn't true. EHRLICHMAN:Well... PRESIDENT:Not that he was uncovered, it was simply thefact that he said, "By God, this thing issuch a cancer and so forth, that I can't write it and there's no way we make astatement," and I said to you, John, "Youbetter get into it." Take...EHRLICHMAN:Yes, but I happen to be... PRESIDENT:Well...EHRLICHMAN:This may be some measure of hindsight, but Ireally don't think it is because my very conscious contemporary reaction when Deancame back and didn't have anything for us,was, whoops, there's something more here, because Dean could have constructed some kind of an artful ah, ah, evasion if hehadn't been so pervasively involved.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.13PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:For the, for the campaign committee or theWhite House, or whoever he wanted toprotect, but, uhh, the thing that occurredto me when, when Bob told me what Dean said that he couldn't, he couldn't write it. Ijust had a mental image of the guy sittingthere with big piles of paper saying, "I've just written a confession, and I would be nuts to deliver this to anybody."PRESIDENT:Well, that's what we have to say.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think, I think that's very veryprobable.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Yup. PRESIDENT:Dean's got Shaffer and the rest. I don'tknow that he can't be, we may be able toexert privilege on Dean before the GrandJury but we can't before the press. I(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:You can at the trial. And you certainly canin the press. Uh, uh...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:I'd send, I'd send a fellow around to talkto Dean if this is a problem. Just say,"Look here, you are going to be liable, separately liable, for breach of confidentiality and, ah,...PRESIDENT:Is that a case?EHRLICHMAN:...Well, I think you ought to get Petersento advise you on this, but there certainlyis, there certainly is a statutoryprotection, and I think you could invoke it.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.14PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) breach of confidentialityof a conversation with the President?EHRLICHMAN:Well, no, not as such, but on variousnational security bases, I, I'm just notthat familiar with the statutes. I don't know what all you have in the way ofstatutory protection, but you remember thatour CIA case...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...where the guy was enjoined by thecourt...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...we fell back on that body of law.PRESIDENT:Incidentally, the other point he says thatDean obviously knows all of these and that's why he says Bittman is gravely concerned about the matter of the l20 because thatgets him involved.EHRLICHMAN:Sure. PRESIDENT:So, we may not, just Dean may talk aboutthis but Bittman is not likely to. I wouldsay, "What the hell is in it for Bittman tosay that we asked for that." I just ask you, does that (unintelligible) the lawyer?EHRLICHMAN:Boy, put him in the soup. Puts him in. thesoup, sure.PRESIDENT:That he came and said, "I want 120 for... EHRLICHMAN:You bet.PRESIDENT:"...for, or otherwise you're going to blowthe whistle or something."EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah, you're right.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.15PRESIDENT:So here you've got a --EHRLICHMAN:So this is good information. Would behelpful, this fits right into ourconversation in there. I will talk, I'lltell you what I think I would do...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...if you don't mind, I will take JohnWilson aside and talk to him about this separation business.PRESIDENT:Right, that's right.EHRLICHMAN:He's very wise and very...PRESIDENT:I don't know how and we've got to get hisjudgment on it -- But Bob said this morning(unintelligible) We have to (unintelligible)ourselves (unintelligible). In a sense though, let's face it, John Mitchell lurks in the back here -- isn't that what itreally gets down to? But God Almighty, weweren't protecting the White House now, right?EHRLICHMAN:That's correct.PRESIDENT:We weren't protecting that, we're protectingJohn Mitchell.EHRLICHMAN:Yes sir.P RESIDENT:All the way through.EHRLICHMAN:In the first instance we were protectingyour your re-election in a sense. We didn't know what from.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:Afterwards, though, this cover up businesswas pure Mitchell.PRESIDENT:Sure, now. Bob says that, you know, you're,you're going to look bad if he goes.********** EHRLICHMAN:Well, there are two ways of looking at that,obviously --
