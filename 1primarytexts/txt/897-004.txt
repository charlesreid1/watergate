DEAN:Are we talking Dean, or are we talking Dean,Ehrlichman, and Haldeman?PRESIDENT:Well, I'm talking Dean DEAN:Dean.PRESIDENT:at this moment.DEAN:All right. PRESIDENT:Dean at this moment, because you're going tobe, uh, you, yo&#8482;"re going to be doing it.I'll have to handle them, also. But, thepoint is, what's your advice that we -You see, the point is, we, we don't have -I just, I just got it, I just typed up acouple, just to have here which I'd bewilling to put out. You know,-2-DEAN:Uhhuh.PRESIDENT:in the event that, uh, certain thingsoccurred.DEAN:I understand.PRESIDENT:But you see, put the, uh, the, put, justputting the -you don't want to put any lies into it. Uh [unintelligible]. What's youradvice?DEAN:I think, I think it'd be the -good to haveit on hand.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:I would think, to be very honest with you --PRESIDENT:Have those others, too? DEAN:Have those others, also.PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah. I will. Well as a matter offact, they both su--, suggested it for themselves.DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:So I got that, uh -I am sorry, Steve, I hitthe wrong bell.-3-DEAN:[Laughs]PRESIDENT:So I've already done that with them. DEAN:All right. PRESIDENT:So, they said, "Look, uh, they're ready anytime you want them.&#64258; I've got that. Now Iwant to get your advice on that, too. So what I would, now what I would think we wantto do, we should have it in two differentforms, here. We should have it -and I, would like to discuss with you the forms. It seems to me that your, the form should be,uh, uh, request an immediate indefiniteleave of absence. That'd be one thing. And the other, of course, would be, uh, just astraight resignation.DEAN:Uh huh. PRESIDENT:Uh, first, uh, what I would suggest is thatyou sign both. That's what I had in mind.And then we'll talk about after, uh, becauseyou don't know yet what you&#8482;re going -For example, you could go in and plead guilty. You'd have to resign.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:If, on the other hand, you're going in, uh,on a, some other basis, then I think a leaveof absence is then-4-DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:the proper thing to do. DEAN:I would think so. PRESIDENT:And, uh, that's the way I would discuss itwith, uh, with others, too. But if you haveany other thoughts, let me know. I&#8482;m not trying to press you on a thing. Just, I justwant to be sure, John, you've got therecord, that you&#8482;re, you're, uh, so that I've done everything that I [clears throat] [unintelligible]. Do you agree?DEAN:Uh, I, I think it's a good idea. I franklydo.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:But, uh, I think if you do it for, for one-I think you have problems with others too, Mr. President.PRESIDENT:I already have done that with others.DEAN:Yeah. All right. That's what I've beentrying to advise you that, you knowPRESIDENT:But on theirs, on theirs, on theirs, boththe, uh, uh, pending the, uh -It, it is allpending their appearance, and so forth.Just as it is in yours. Nothing&#8482;s going to be said.-5-DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:But I've got to have it in hand. You seewhat I mean? I mean, my, my reason, as I told them -As a matter of fact, after ourtalk last night, I told them, I said, "We,I've got to have it in hand so that I can move on this, if, uh, as Petersen is goingto report to me every day.&#64258; You see?DEAN:Uh huh. PRESIDENT:I said, "Now, Petersen," I said, "if you getthis stuff confirmed," I said, "I need toknow.&#64258; And he said, "Well, I, uh --" &#8218;causeI asked him, I asked him specifically, I said, "What, what are you, uh, what, uh,what are. you going to do?&#64258; He says, "Well,LaRue is going to be today.&#64258; And, I don't know who else. Strachan's going to be today. There are three today I think. Idon't know. Who's the third one?DEAN:I don&#8482;t know. PRESIDENT:That's right. You&#8482;re not supposed to.[Laughter]PRESIDENT:Uh, then, okay.DEAN:What I would like to do is, is to draft upfor you an alternative letter. Put it inboth options and you can just put them inthe file.-6-PRESIDENT:Uh. huh.DEAN:Uh, just short and, and sweet. PRESIDENT:Uh huh. All right. Fine. I had, I haddictated some thing myself, on my own, whichI just, which is, which is, uh[unintelligible] how this -But you don't have to. If you can give me a better form,fine. I want you to do it either way. Doyou, uh, or do you want to just prepare something?DEAN:I'd like to prepare something.PRESIDENT:Good. All right. Fine. Why don't you takethis? And, uh, take those, just as anDEAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:idea, and have something that, uk -I've gotto see Petersen at 1:30.DEAN:All right. PRESIDENT:Understand, I don't want it s-put anythingout, because I don't want to jeopardize yourposition at, at all. You've got a right to, just as everybody else has, to, to let&#8482;s say you've been &#338;you&#8482;ve carried a hell of a loadhere and I -But I just feel that since whatyou said last night that we've got to do on this and with, uh, Haldeman and Ehrlichman-I have, I have leave of absences from them.Which, however, I will not use until I get the word from Petersen on corroboration,-7-DEAN:All right.PRESIDENT:which he, which he advised himself. Italked to him after I talked to you. Left about 11:45. I told the son-of-a-bitch, hedoesn't know how hard we work around here.DEAN:And you will have something, uh, uh, withina couple of hours.PRESIDENT:Well, I.DEAN:You think just put it in the file? PRESIDENT:I won't be back, I won't be back, uh. Yeah.You, you can, uh, you draft what you want meto -in other words--DEAN:And if you don't like what I draft, tell meand I will change it in any wayPRESIDENT:Oh, sure, sure.DEAN:that you want. PRESIDENT:But I can't make a decision DEAN:Yes sir.PRESIDENT:of course you see -And, and also, it may, itmay depend -Well, put it this way, put it this way, you draft what-8-you, what you want. And we can, uh, if Ihave any concerns about it, I'll give you a ring. You can, uh, be around, and so forth.DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:And, uh, but, but, you would agree youshould -but nothing should be put out now. Right?DEAN:I would agree. I was, I was thinking aboutthat.PRESIDENT:You see, we&#8482;ve got the problem --today thething may break. You know, with Magruder,uh, and so forth. Ant uh, I'm, uh, I -Youknow what I mean. That's what I wanted to run over with you, briefly, as to, you know,to get your feeling again as to how wehandle it, how we -You know, you, you were saying the President should stay ahe--, one step ahead of this thing. Well, we've got,uh -The point is, the only problem is whatthe hell can I say publicly? Now, here&#8482;s what we've done.DEAN:Well, you see --PRESIDENT:I called in -I got in Kleindienst. Uh,we"ve I've been working on it all week.DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:Actually, I mean I got, as soon as I got theMagruder thing, then I, I got in Kleindienst, and, uh, then at four o"clock we got in, uh, sold uh, Petersen.-9-Kleindienst withdrew, uh, and, uh, uh,assigned Petersen. I said, "All right, Henry, I don't want to talk to Kleindienst anymore about this case. I'm just going totalk to you.""DEAN:Uh huh. PRESIDENT:"You're in charge. You follow through andyou're going through to get to the bottom ofthis thing and I am going to let the chips fall where they may.&#64258; And we covered that all the way down the line. Now, I have tofollow him to a certain extent on theprosecution side. On the other hand, on the PR side, I sure as hell am not going to letthe Justice Department step out thereDEAN:Right. PRESIDENT:and say, "Look, we dragged the White Housein here.&#64258; I've got to step out and do it,John.DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Don&#8482;t you agree? DEAN:That's right. Uh --PRESIDENT:But yet, I don&#8482;t want to walk out and say,"I -Look, John Dean&#8482;s resignation has been accepted.&#64258; Jesus Christ, that isn't fair.-10-DEAN:Nor would it be fair to say Ehr--,Ehrlichmanand Haldeman's have.PRESIDENT:Yeah. What -- DEAN:You know, I, I've already examined --PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] because you see theyhaven't been charged yet. As soon as they're charged [unintelligible]. But seehe's -But in your case, is you haven't beencharged with anything yet --DEAN:No, I have not. PRESIDENT:That's my problem, see with it --DEAN:Uh --PRESIDENT:All I wanted is to have on -The only reasonI'm doing this is to, uh, because of you,what you said about some, what you saidabout them, and that's why I'm getting it from them too.DEAN:Well, it's a, there's a chance, uh, uh-Well, there's a chance that today whenLaRue goes down that Haldeman and Ehrlichman's name are going to be right down there before the Grand Jury.PRESIDENT:Right. Well, the name will be in, but thepoint is, you don't just throw somebody out because of a name lying in court.DEAN:I, I understand.PRESIDENT:You understand. Uh, would you, you couldalso, if you-11-would, here's, uh, and I would like for youto prepare this in a letter that you would have for Ehrlichman and Haldeman. Would you do that too?DEAN:Yes sir.PRESIDENT:And then I'll give them the form and letthem work out their -something that'sappropriate. Would you pre pare that forme, then?DEAN:Yes, I will. PRESIDENT:But they told me last night, orally, just asyou did, that, uh --DEAN:They stand ready. PRESIDENT:Cover the record. They said, "Look, we willleave in a minute. We'll leave-today. Youcan do whatever you want." And I said, "What the hell, we're going to have to wait until we get some evidence.&#64258; You know whatI mean?DEAN:Uh huh. PRESIDENT:Which I think you agree with. DEAN:I--That's what I do, and the question istiming, and, uh-12-PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:Uh -- PRESIDENT:Now, let's get Dean's advice as to how wehandle this now, from, uh, now on. What isyour, what's your advice?DEAN:Well, I would say you should have theletters in hand and, thenPRESIDENT:Right.DEAN:based on what you learn from Petersen, youcan make a judgment as to timing. I mean, I think you're still five steps ahead of whatwill ever emerge publicly. I don't thinkthey --PRESIDENT:They think in twelve hours it may break,somebody told me the news -the P68t'saccording to Ziegler, has got something now on this. Magruder talking around and every thing. I don't know.DEAN:Well, I know, I know what -some of thethings Magruder said. He said that, uh, that the prosecutors had asked him a number of questions about Ehrlichman and Haldeman.So there's no, there's no doubt that that'sgoing to be out on the, uh,-13-PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:the street fast also. PRESIDENT:Well, then we ought to move on that too. DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:That's my point. You see --DEAN:It's unfortunate that I, you know, I'mhoping that the ultimate resolution of thisthing is that no one has any problems. Andthat's possible,PRESIDENT:Legally. DEAN:legally.PRESIDENT:That's right. Which I hope is your case,too. In other words, when I say no one, nobody at the White House staff -not you,not Colson, not Ehrlichman, not Haldeman,because God damn it -Let me, let me, let me summarize this specific point again, because I need to, uh, you know, they, we know therewas no -on the Dean report. Ziegler hasalways said it was oral.DEAN:That's right.-14-PRESIDENT:Right. But you remember when you cane in, Iasked you the specific question: "Is anybody on the White House Staff involved?&#64258; You told me "No."DEAN:That's right. And I have no knowledge --PRESIDENT:You still believe that? DEAN:Yes sir, I do.PRESIDENT:Yeah. But you did tell me that in theaftermath there were serious problems.DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Right. And, I said, "Well, let's see whatthey are.&#64258; Right?DEAN:And now you're beginning to see what theyare. They're potential, technical,obstruction of justice problems.PRESIDENT:Sure. But not necessarily. DEAN:[Unintelligible] PRESIDENT:Well, I talked to Petersen last night and hemade exactly the same point. He says theobstruction was morally wrong. No, not morally. He said, it may not have been morally wrong, and it may not be legallywrong, but he said from the standpoint ofthe Presidency, you can't have it. That&#8482;s-15-what his point was. So he, he seems tothink that this, uh, that the obstruction of justice thing is a God damn hard thing to prove.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:To prove in court, which I, I think shouldbe some comfort to you.DEAN:Well, my lawyer tells me that, you know,"Legally, you're in, you're in damn good shape."PRESIDENT:Is that right?DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Because, uh, you're not-- DEAN:That's right. It's, it's a--PRESIDENT:You were simply helping the defendants gettheir fees and their --DEAN:Well -- PRESIDENT:Huh? What does he say?DEAN:In that, in that position, I'm merely aconduit. Uh, it's-16-very technical, very technical. I am aconduit to other people. That is the problem.PRESIDENT:Ub huh. What was the situation, John? This-The only time I ever heard any discussionof, uh, this supporting of the defendants -and I must say I, I guess I should haveassumed somebody was helping them, I musthave assumed it, but, uh, and, and I must say people were good in a way, I, I was busy -was when you mentioned to me some,something, about the, I mean, I think thelast time we talked about Hal, uh, Hunt having a problem.DEAN:Well --PRESIDENT:But that, and that was, then we, but thatwas handled at, by Mitchell. Was that true or what the hell happened?DEAN:That's, that&#8482;s -The last time we had arequest was the, wasPRESIDENT:How did it work out? Did you-? DEAN:the Monday before sentencing.PRESIDENT:He hit you with a, uh, uh,DEAN:No. PRESIDENT:at a dinner or something?-17-DEAN:No, no. O'Brien, who was one of the lawyerswho was representing the Re-election Committee, was asked by Hunt to meet with him. He came to me after the meeting andsaid that, "Hunt asked the following messagebe passed to you.&#64258; And I said, "Why me?&#64258; He said, "I asked Hunt the same question.&#64258;PRESIDENT:To you, Dean, or to me, the President?DEAN:Asked of me, PRESIDENT:Oh. DEAN:Dean.PRESIDENT:Oh yeah.DEAN:It&#8482;s the first time I'd ever heard anythinglike this. And I said, uh --PRESIDENT:He had never askedDEAN:No. PRESIDENT:you before. DEAN:No. Uh--PRESIDENT:Let me tell you. What did you report to meon it, though? I -It was rather fragmentary, as I recall it. You said,-18-DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:"Hunt had a problem," and, uh -- DEAN:Very fragmentary. I was, I -- PRESIDENT:Yeah, but that's not the thing. I, I said,"What, what -John, what&#8482;s it going to costto do this?&#64258; Uh, that's when I sent you to Camp -and said, "Well, for God's sake, let'ssee where this thing comes out.&#64258;DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:And you said it'd cost a million dollars. DEAN:I said, "It," you know, "it conceivablycould, and the way this," I said, "If wedon't cut this thing&#352;&#64257;PRESIDENT:Exactly.DEAN:Uh, anyway --PRESIDENT:But that's the only conversation we had.Where -How was that handled? Who the hell handled that, that money?DEAN:Uh, well, let me tell you the rest -what,what Hunt said. He said, "You tell Dean that I need seventy-two thousand dollars for my personal expenses, fifty thousand dollarsfor my legal fees.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Uh huh.-19-DEAN:"If I don't get it, I'm going to have somethings to say about the seamy things I did at the White House for John Ehrlichman.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Uh huh.DEAN:All right. I took that to Ehrlichman.Ehrlichman said, uh, "Have you talked to Mitchell about it?&#64258; I said, "No, I havenot.&#64258; Uh, he said, "Well, will you talk toMitchell?&#64258; I said, "Yes, I will.&#64258; I talked to Mitchell. I just passed it along to him. And then there was a meeting down here a fewdays later in, in Bob"s office with Bob andEhrlichman and Mitchell and myself. And, uh, Ehrlichman said at that time, he said,"Well is that problem with Hunt straightenedout?&#64258; He said it to me and I said, "Well, ask the man who may know: Mitchell.&#64258; And Mitchell said, "I think that problem issolved.&#64258;PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s all? DEAN:That's all he said. PRESIDENT:Right. That&#8482;s good. In other words, thatwas done at the Mitchell level?DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:But, you had knowledge; Haldeman had a lotof knowledge; and-20-Ehrlichman had knowledge.DEAN:Right. PRESIDENT:And I suppose I did. I mean, I am planningto assume some culpability on that[unintelligible]DEAN:I don't think so. PRESIDENT:Why not?DEAN:Uh --PRESIDENT:I plan to be tough on myself as I am on theother thing, though, 1, 1 must say I didn't really give it a thought at the time becauseI didn't know, uh --DEAN:No one gave it a thought. PRESIDENT:You did. You did.DEAN:No one --PRESIDENT:You didn't tell me this about Ehrlichman,for example. When you came in on that dayDEAN:I know.PRESIDENT:you simply said, "Hunt needs this money.&#64258;And you were using it as an example of the problems ahead.-21-DEAN:I, I have tried, uh, all along to make surethat anything I passed to you myself didn't cause you any personal problems.PRESIDENT:John, let me ask you this. Let us supposeif this thing breaks and they ask you, JohnDean: "Now, John you were the President's Counsel. Did you report things to thePresident? What did you report to thePresident?&#64258;DEAN:I, I would, I would refuse to answer anyquestions as to anything --PRESIDENT:No, no, no, no, uh, no -I think you should-Let me ask you this.DEAN:Unless you waive --PRESIDENT:Let me say, on this point, I would, uh,would not waive. You could say, "I reported to the President.&#64258; Uh, that "The President called me in.&#64258; I mean, "The President hasauthorized me to say -He called me in, and,uh, and, uh, asked me&#352;&#64257;DEAN:Uh huh. PRESIDENT:Uh, make that, that before, that when theevent first occurred, you conducted aninvestigation and passed to-22-the President the message: "No White Housepersonnel, according to your investigation, was involved.&#64258; You did do that, didn't you?DEAN:I did that through Ehrlichman and Haldeman.PRESIDENT:That's it. You did do that.DEAN:If I'm under oath, now, I'm, I'm going tohave to say I did that through Ehrlichmanand Haldeman.PRESIDENT:No. But I know you did that. I didn't seeyou.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Remember I didn't see you until after theelection.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:But you see -all right. Now, but then yousay, "And then, after the election, the President, when the McCord thing broke, called you in.&#64258; I think that's when it was,wasn't it?DEAN:No, uh -- PRESIDENT:After the McCord thing. DEAN:No. It was before the McCord thing becauseyou remember you told me after the Fridaymorning that McCord's letter--PRESIDENT:Uh huh.-23-DEAN:He said, "He predicted this. This was goingto happen." Because I had, oh, in, in about the week, uh, or two weeks --PRESIDENT:How did it --Why did I get you in there?What, what triggered me getting you in?DEAN:Well, we just started, we just startedtalking about this thing, and --PRESIDENT:But I called you in, you and Moore together,didn't I?DEAN:Well -- PRESIDENT:For a Dean Report.DEAN:On, uh, on, uh, Wednesday morning --PRESIDENT:Because, what was -well, I know what wasinvolved. What was involved was the damnedexecutive privilege and all that crap.DEAN:That's right. It was -The Gray things werepopping, but on the,PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:the Wednesday morning before I asked --PRESIDENT:We had three conversations to myrecollection.DEAN:Oh, sir, I think we had more than that, but,of course, we'd have, uh, we'd have a recordof that through-24-PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:those people. I think we had more thanthat. But the, the one report where I finally -I called Bob --PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] this office. Good.,DEAN:Yeah. I called Bob and I said, I said,"Bob", I said, "I don't think the Presidenthas all the facts."PRESIDENT:That's right. And then you came and sat inthis chair and that's the first time that I realized the thing.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:And what -And now the question is: "Well,Mr. Dean, why didn't you tell the Presidentbefore?&#64258; And your answer there is --DEAN:I didn't know. That is absolutely correct. PRESIDENT:That's what you told me last time. You see,I don't want you, John, to be in a position,and frankly I don't want the President to bein a position where one of his trusted people had information that he did keep, kept from him. So I just want--DEAN:I did not know.-25-PRESIDENT:Fine. You did not know. "How did you findout then?" they'll ask. Okay. But you -that's your -but you can handle that.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:But I, but, but I did ask you and I think, Ithink you should say the President has authorized you to say this: "I won't revealthe conversation with the President, buthe's -and, uh, he asked me this question. I told him this, and he, uh, uh, that nobody in the White House was involved. And then,in addition to that, that I, I, uh, to thebest of my ability kept, uh --" I guess -or what do you think you ought to handle withthe Presidential things?DEAN:Well, PRESIDENT:Maybe you better DEAN:I, I, I think, the less said about --PRESIDENT:All right. Fine.DEAN:I think that's privileged, and I think[unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Except, except that if you do this --DEAN:I think you say anything you want to sayabout it.PRESIDENT:Right. But I have to say it. Well, let metell you, I am going to handle that properlyand I just want to be sure-26-that it, that it, it jibes with the facts.I can say that you did tell me that nobody in the White House was involved and I can say that you then cane in, at your request,and said, "I think the President needs tohear more about this case."DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:And it was that time that I started myinvestigation.DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Correct?DEAN:That was the Wednesday before they weresentenced. Now, I can get that date, I don't have it off the top --PRESIDENT:Would you do me this? Get your chronology ofthat Wednesday you came in and told me. That would be helpful for me to have.DEAN:That's what I had in mind --PRESIDENT:You see, I want to --DEAN:(Unintelligible] PRESIDENT:You see, I -That's when I became interested.I was -I became frankly interested in thecase and I said, "Now-27-God damn it, I want to find out the score.&#64258;And I set in motion Ehrlichman, Mitchell and a few of -not Mitchell, but others. Okay.DEAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:One other thing. An the privilege thing, Ithink, uh -Nothing, so that you could be sure, that, you know, nothing is privilegedthat involves wrongdoingDEAN:That's correct. PRESIDENT:on your part or wrongdoing on the part ofanybody else. I, I, I'm telling you that nowand I want you to s-when you testify, if youdo, to say that the President has told you that. Would you do that?DEAN:Yes, air.PRESIDENT:Would you agree with that? DEAN:I do. PRESIDENT:Fine. However, let me say that, uh, withregard to, with regard to what we call theelectronic, uh, stuff they heard in what I have now have found is in the leak area, national security area, uh, that I considerprivileged.DEAN:I do too.-28-PRESIDENT:And I think you should say, for example, onthat -But what I meant is, uh, uh,-I would, uh. I think in, in the case of the, of the Kraft stuff, what the FBI did, they wereboth, I find -I've checked it back -therewere some done, some done through, uh, private sources. Most of it was donethrough the Bureau after we got going.DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Hoover didn't want to do, uh, to do Kraft.But what it involved, John, apparently wasthis: there were leaks in the NSC. Theywere in Kraft and other columns. We were trying to plug the leaks.DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:And we had that, so we checked it out.Finally, we turned it over to Hoover. Then when the hullabaloo developed we didn't, wejust stopped it altogether.DEAN:I understand. PRESIDENT:And that includes [unintelligible]. But inmy, uh, view I consider that privileged.DEAN:I have no intention of raising that in any--PRESIDENT:Have you informed your lawyers about that?DEAN:No.PRESIDENT:I think you should not. Understand, notbecause of cutting anything, except that I do think it's privileged. But it's-29-up to, up to you, I mean, I--DEAN:No. I think it is privileged, also. PRESIDENT:Yeah. It's important to know, and this wasnecessary to use. We had Hoover do a littlebit, and in control, as Lyndon Johnson[unintelligible] better. Uh, now, your, your guess as when -well, I'll ask Petersentoday -when will you be called? PerhapsTuesday, Wednesday, or--DEAN:I would think sometime this week. PRESIDENT:You don't think the thing is likely to breaktoday, then, huh?DEAN:No, I don't. PRESIDENT:I wonder what Ziegler&#8482;s got. He must have-He seems, he seems to think thatsomething's going to go. He hasn't been in to see me. I'll have to get him in later. But, uh, well, I&#8482;ll have him make &#338;I&#8482;ll askPetersen.DEAN:Uh huh. PRESIDENT:Petersen. But don't you agree with me DEAN:I don't think --PRESIDENT:that the President should make the firstannouncement and not the Justice Department?-30-DEAN:Yes, I do.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible] DEAN:[Unintelligible) on his own staff. PRESIDENT:Uh?DEAN:On his own staff.PRESIDENT:Oh, hell, I&#8482;m going to make the announcementwith regard to Magruder, too. God damn it,it's our campaign. I'm not going to havethe Justice DepartmentDEAN:Oh, I see what you mean. PRESIDENT:We triggered this whole thing. You knowwhat I mean?DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Don't you agree?DEAN:Well, if, if, if, if -When the --PRESIDENT:You helped trigger it. DEAN:When history is written, you'll, and you putthe pieces back together, you'll see why ithappened. It's because I triggered it. I,I put everybody's feet to the fire because it just had to stop.PRESIDENT:That's right. And you put --DEAN:And I still continue to feel that, uh----31-PRESIDENT:That's right. You put Magruder's feet tothe fire.DEAN:Yes, I did. PRESIDENT:Where did you see Magruder? UhDEAN:I didn't. I sent -In fact, I refused to seehim. That was one of the problems.PRESIDENT:Oh. And that's why he --DEAN:I started, I talked to him. I, I met withhim in, in one of these outer offices out here at a meeting.PRESIDENT:What got Magruder to talk?DEAN:Uh --PRESIDENT:I would like to take the credit. DEAN:Because, because, well, uh,[laughs] he knewthat --PRESIDENT:I thought--I was hoping that you had seenhim, because, uh --DEAN:There wasWell, he was, he was told, he wastold (1) that, you know, there was going tobe no chance--PRESIDENT:You remember, though, when you made thestatement about, uh, just making a note hereabout drawing the wagons up around the WhiteHouse. Uh, based uh, basically you thought the primary [unintelligible] -this wastalking about pre--32-DEAN:Pre--PRESIDENT:knowledge -was all in the Committee. Right? DEAN:That's right. Where it is. PRESIDENT:That's right. But on Magruder, come again.What's the deal, deal there?DEAN:Uh, the, uh, uh, situation there is that heand Mitchell were continuing to talk,continuing to talk about proceeding alongthe same course they'd been proceeding to, to lock in their story, but my story did not fit with their story. And I just told themI refused to change, to alter my testimony,other than, than to repeat it just as I knew it.PRESIDENT:When?DEAN:This had to do with a number of meetings inthe Department of Justice.PRESIDENT:Incidentally I heard this [unintelligible),but I, I remember. You told me this.Everybody tells me that you said, Dean said, "I will not go to the -I am not going down there and lie," because you said you, yourhand will shake and your emotion -Rememberyou told me that?DEAN:Yeah. No way I could. I'm incapable of it.-33-PRESIDENT:Fine. Thank God, John. Don't ever do it,John. I want you to tell the truth. That's the thing that you're going to -I have told everybody around here, said, "God damn it,tell the truth.&#64258; 'Cause all they do, John,is compound it.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:That son-of-a-bitch Hiss would be free todayif he hadn't lied about his espionage. He could have just said he -he didn't even have to. He could've just said, "I -look, Iknew, Chambers. And, yes, as a young man Iwas involved with some Communist activities but I broke it off many years ago.&#64258; AndChambers would have dropped it.DEAN:Well PRESIDENT:But, the son-of-a-bitch lied, and he goes tojail for the lie rather than the crime.DEAN:Uh --PRESIDENT:So believe me, don't ever lie with thesebastards.DEAN:The, the truth always emerges.PRESIDENT:We know that.-34-DEAN:It always does.PRESIDENT:Also, there is a question of right andwrong, too.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:What is right and what is wrong.DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Perhaps there are gray areas, but you'reright to, to get it out now.DEAN:Uh-- PRESIDENT:I'm sure. On Liddy, I wanted to be surethat I, that you recall, on ourconversation, I, uh -You asked me to dosomething. I've left it with Petersen now. He said he'd handle it. Uh, that's theproper place --DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:You see, when Liddy says he can't talkunless he hears from higher authority--I amnot his higher authority.DEAN:No. PRESIDENT:It's Mitchell. DEAN:Well, but I think he's looking for theultimate --PRESIDENT:What do you think he's thinking about?-35-DEAN:I think he's thinking about the President.PRESIDENT:Clemency? DEAN:He thinks -he has the impression that youand Mitchell probably talk on the telephonedaily about this.PRESIDENT:You know we've never talked about it. DEAN:I understand that.PRESIDENT:I have never talked to Mitchell about this.Oh, except about when, whether we go, uh, the executive privilege thing.DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:He came in and said, "Everybody shouldtestify in executive session.&#64258; Mitchell said that. Except you. Which I think wouldbe -Listen, I think, incidentally, aboutexecutive privilege --DEAN:I think, I think, Mr. President, the ErvinhearingsPRESIDENT:The later--DEAN:are going to fizzle. PRESIDENT:What? DEAN:I think when the, when, when Petersenfinishes his ---36-PRESIDENT:You don't think we should hold to executiveprivilege anyway do you, John, now?DEAN:To hold an executive privilege? PRESIDENT:Yeah. What's your advice on that. Whatshould I do?DEAN:I think, I think if you, if, if there areindictments down there in that court room,none, none of the individuals should go upand testify. I think the Watergate is just going-to be totally carved out of the Ervin hearings.PRESIDENT:Yeah. That's the Watergate, right? Then theother stuff is not that important, Segretti and all that?DEAN:Segretti, yeah.PRESIDENT:Um huh. DEAN:That stuff is not that important. They'llprobably -They can have a lot of fun withit, but it's not very meaningful.PRESIDENT:So you think Liddy thought that I wascalling Mitchell. [Unintelligible] Good God Almighty. Well, we covered that last[unintelligible]DEAN: That's right. PRESIDENT:You were there.-37-DEAN:That's resolved. thinkPRESIDENT:Is that enough? DEAN:That's right. Petersen wi -ou if itdoesn't, uh --PRESIDENT:You tell me now if it isn't enough.DEAN:No, I think it's enough. PRESIDENT:I'm going to expect you to -After all,you're still the Counsel around here.[Laughter) No, but I'm serious. You've got to advise me and that's the same with Haldeman and Ehrlichman. As long as you arearound here, we've got to, we got to have itout.DEAN:Well, I, I want, I want to lay one thingout.PRESIDENT:Uh huh. DEAN:I think there is a mythical belief, uh, I'venot talked to Bob or John about this -thatthey don't have a problem, Mr. President.And I'm, I'm really not sure you're convinced they do. But I'm telling you, they do.PRESIDENT:A problem?-38-DEAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:There's no question about it. DEAN:No question. PRESIDENT:They are --DEAN:I just wantedPRESIDENT:Yeah. Petersen made the point. I said,"Tell me what the facts are.&#64258; And he says,"The problem is, the problem here is thatthey're going to get splashed.&#64258; And, he said, "When they get splashed, you've got a problem, Mr. President."' Now, but then hegoes on to say, as far as the legal form ofit is concerned, and he covers all three of you here,DEAN: Uh huh.PRESIDENT:he said, "It's a very difficult case toprove.&#64258; Do you agree with that?DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:You see, that's the point. And I would hopeit works. I mean I'm speaking now in personal terms. I --DEAN:It's a, it's a technical case and it's atough case.-39-PRESIDENT:"It&#8482;s a tough one to prove.&#64258; What's he meanby that? I --DEAN:Apparently, my, my lawyer said, "Now, I've,I've, I've won cases on this, uh, uh, withtougher facts than you've got, I'll assureyou."PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:It would not, it would not be a --PRESIDENT:See, that's their real vulnerability,together.DEAN:It would be, uh --PRESIDENT:Both Ehrlichman and Haldeman are in on theobstruction. And that's the point.DEAN:That's right. I think it'd be a very goodidea if they had counsel.PRESIDENT:I told them, yeah, last night to getlawyers, so I'm one step ahead of you there. Now, do you -is there anything else youthink I should do? You don't think I should-Shit, I'm not going to let the Justice Department break this case, John.DEAN:I understand. You've got to break it. Youare breaking it, in a sense.-40-PRESIDENT:Well, God damn it, that's what we've done.DEAN:That&#8482;s right. PRESIDENT:I could have told you to go to Camp Davidand concoct a story, couldn't I?DEAN:That&#8482;s right.PRESIDENT:And you've never heard that said, have you? DEAN:No, sir.PRESIDENT:In fact, I think I know [unintelligible].But on the other hand, it was your job to tell me, wasn't it?DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:And you have. Basically what you've done-No, you, you've told me the truth, though. You've told me the truth. It was your jobto work for the White House, the President,the White House staff, and they were not involved in the pre-thing. But then you thought about the post-thing. You thoughtabout it and that's why you decided to -Yousaid, "Cut it Out"-41-DEAN:That's why I thinkPRESIDENT:Right. DEAN:the cancer"s growing because you PRESIDENT:Right.DEAN:t-, t-, t- to keep this whole thing in.PRESIDENT:Look, one thing I want to be sure is inhere, when you testify, I don&#8482;t want you tobe in a position, so, and I don't want thePresident to be in a position that his counsel did not level with him. See my point?DEAN:No, sir, there&#8482;s no point that I have notleveled with you, as you know.PRESIDENT:No, what I meant is, when you say, "Well,now Mr. Dean,&#64258; I am speaking nowDEAN:They will, they will not ask[unintelligible]PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]."Why didn't, why didn&#8482;t youtell the President? Did you know about this?Why didn&#8482;t you tell the President?''DEAN:That's a PR situation, Mr. President. TheU.S. Attorneys are not going to ask mequestion asPRESIDENT:I see. DEAN:to what I said to the President or what Ididn&#8482;t.PRESIDENT:Will, I favor, I frankly think -I would, Iwould hope you could help on the PR there by--42-DEAN:Be expecting to help on it --PRESIDENT:I would like for you to say, and you're freeto talk about it. You're to say, "I, I told the President about this. I told thePresident first there was no involvement inthe White House. Afterwards, I told the President that, uh, that I -And thePresident said, &#64257;Look, I want to get to thebottom of this thing, period." See what I'm driving at -not just the White House. You continued your investigation, and so forth.The President went ahead, investigated inhis own way, which I have done.DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:Believe me. I put a little pressure onDEAN:Uh huh. PRESIDENT:Magruder and a few of these clowns. And,uh, "As a result of the President's action,this thing has been broken.''DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Because also I put pressure on the JusticeDepartment. I told Kleindienst, "God damnit, that&#352;&#64257;DEAN:No, I think, I think you're in front rightnow and I, and, uh, you can rest assuredeverything I do will, will keep-43-you as far as --PRESIDENT:No, I don't want that, understand? When Isay, "Don't lie," don't lie about me either.DEAN:No, I won't sir. You're -I, I&#8482;m not going--PRESIDENT:'Cause I, I, I think I've done the rightthing. But I want, I want you to do it. I want you to do, if, if you feel I've donethe right thing, I want, I think the countryis entitled to know it. Because we're talking about the Presidency here.DEAN:This thing has changed so dramatically, thewhole situation, since I gave you thepicture --PRESIDENT:Since you sat in that chair.DEAN:In that chair over there, and gave you whatI thought were the circumstances, the potential problems, and the like, you have done nothing but try to get to the bottom ofthis, this thing, and,PRESIDENT:I think so. DEAN:and, uh, uh PRESIDENT:Well, I said, "Write a report.&#64258; But mypurpose was to write a report, as I said, Iwant the Segretti matter, uh,-44-put the Segretti stuff in, put everythingelse in. Whether the White House -what was the White House involvement? You know. What do you say? How about one last thing:Colson. Uh, you don't think that they&#8482;regoing to get him into this, huh?DEAN:I think, I think he has some technicalproblems -post -also. I don't know if hehas any, if, uh -to the best of my knowledge, he has no, had, had no advance knowledge of the thing.PRESIDENT:Right. I suppose the key there is Hunt, youknow, the He was so close to Hunt. I just want to know about it just for my ownbenefit. I, as I told you last night, I, Idon't want, I don't wantDEAN:Chuck has, PRESIDENT:to be in a position &#338;DEAN:Chuck has,PRESIDENT:"What about Chuck Colson?&#64258; I want-- DEAN:Chuck has sworn up and down to me PRESIDENT:I'm going to say you, John Dean, was Colsoninvolved?-45-DEAN:I have no information that he was at all.PRESIDENT:Post? DEAN:Technical problems. PRESIDENT:Those two things you mentioned last night.DEAN:That and, uh, let's face it, there's othertechnical problems, but, you know --PRESIDENT:Hm. Yeah.DEAN:It's, uh, it&#8482;s, uh, all the obstruction istechnical stuff that mounts up.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well, you take, for example, theclemency stuff. That's solely Mitchell,apparently, and Colson's talk with, uh,Bittman where he says, "I'll do everything I can because as a, as a friend -"DEAN:No, that was with Ehrlichman.PRESIDENT:Huh? DEAN:That was Ehrlichman. PRESIDENT:Ehrlichman with who?DEAN:Ehrlichman and Colson and I sat up there,and Colson presented his story to Ehrlichman-46-PRESIDENT:I know.DEAN:regarding it and, and then John gave Chuckvery clear instructions on going back and telling him that it, you know, "Give him theinference he&#8482;s got clemency but don't givehim any commitment.&#64258;PRESIDENT:No commitment?DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:Now that&#8482;s all right. But first, if anindividual, if it's no commitment -I've got a right to sit here--Take a fellow like Huntor, uh, or, or a Cuban whose wife is sickand something -that's what clemency's about.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Correct?DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:But, uh, but John specifically said, "Nocommitment,&#64258; did he? He --DEAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:No commitment. Then, then Colson then wenton to, apparently --DEAN:I don&#8482;t know how Colson delivered it, uh,-47-PRESIDENT:Apparently to BittmanDEAN:for-- PRESIDENT:Bittman. Is that your understanding? DEAN:Yes, but I don't know what his, you know,specific--PRESIDENT:Where did this business of the Christmasthing get out, John? What the hell was that?DEAN:Well, that"s, a, that's a --PRESIDENT:That must have been Mitchell, huh? DEAN:No, that was Chuck, again. I think that,uh--PRESIDENT:That they all, that they'd all be out byChristmas?DEAN:No, I think he said something to the effectthat Christmas is the time that clemencygenerally occurs.PRESIDENT:Oh, yeah. DEAN:UhPRESIDENT:Well, that doesn't -1, 1, 1 don't think thatis going to hurt him.DEAN:No. PRESIDENT:Do you?-48-DEAN:No.PRESIDENT:"Clemency," he says -One [unintelligible]he&#8482;s a friend of Hunt&#8482;s. I'm just trying to put the best face on it. If it's thewrong-if it is -I've got to know.DEAN:Well, one, one of the things I think youhave to be very careful, and this is whyPetersen will be very good, is, if you takea set of facts and let the prosecutors who have no -they'll be making, making no PR judgments.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:But they'll give you the raw facts as theyrelate to the law, uh, and it's later you'vegot to decide, you know, what public facewill be put on it. In other words, they'll-If their --PRESIDENT:Oh, I understand.DEAN:It&#8482;s going to come out in court, you know --PRESIDENT:You can help on that, John. DEAN:Yes sir. PRESIDENT:You know that --DEAN:Uh, wherever I nay be, I'll be available tohelp on that.PRESIDENT:Well, I hope you&#8482;re right. You think youtestify when? Well, Petersen will decidethat, I guess.-49-DEAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Do you want me to say anything to him aboutit?DEAN:No.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] that [unintelligible]lawyers.DEAN:Well, I think my lawyers and, and the U.S.Attorney's Office ought to continue to workin--PRESIDENT:Yeah, I"m haming him report to me daily now, DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:which I judge that I should do. And, uh, soall that I'll say is, I'm going to tell him that we had a talk today and I went overagain the various materials.DEAN:What would be the best thing in the world isif they decide that they've got nothing but technical cases against people at the WhiteHouse and they chuck them all out. That&#8482;s,uh, not impossible.PRESIDENT:Should I, should I help? DEAN:No sir.PRESIDENT:Hah, hah. That's what they ought to hear.-50-DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:It'd be a tough case for them to prove,John.DEAN:Well, they may decide not -I did -not do itand then nothing, none of these things areeven released. It could very well happen.PRESIDENT:Well, that's what I want. I mean, I-Understand, the reason I have to have thatis in case there&#8482;s a break tonight. I don't want to have to call John Dean in Ad say, "Look, John, can I have it?&#64258; It looks likeI was What the Christ am I doing. I, I'vegot to know because I do have some knowledge that there might be vulnerability. All thatI am saying with this, as you know,DEAN:[Clears throat] PRESIDENT:is that I have heard things from the U.S.Attorney, and from John Dean, and from myown people that indicate there could be atechnical violation, that there could be, there could be obstru -Under the circumstances, I feel that it's my duty tohave your resignation in hand. Of course,the President always has a resignation.DEAN:Well, uh --PRESIDENT:How does that sound to you?DEAN:That's right. The, the thing is thephrasing in the letter, uh, is important.-51-PRESIDENT:All right.DEAN:You don't cause anybody, you know, problemswith a fair trial. So that&#8482;s why I'd like to --PRESIDENT:Good, John. Well, that's right. I mean,that's -understand, those are my dictations. I just [unintelligible]DEAN:I understand.PRESIDENT:Only it&#8482;s, only it&#8482;s a form for you. Andyou, you work it out and work it out so that it would be one that could apply to you andthen work out the -and to, uh, Ehrlichman,Haldeman, anybody else.DEAN:Um huh.PRESIDENT:Just a form that I can give anybody.Strachan -No, he's not going.DEAN:Yes, he's gone. USIA. PRESIDENT:Well, that doesn't come to me does it?DEAN:Well, the whole Executive Branch, is, huh--PRESIDENT:No, well, no, I mean, DEAN:No, it wouldn't come-- PRESIDENT:his resignation can be submitted to Keogh.DEAN:That&#8482;s right, Keogh.PRESIDENT:Well, I&#8482;ll get his resignation. And I'lltell -I don't mean about &#338;I&#8482;ll tell thoseguys that he, uh&#352;-52-DEAN:I would have -I don"t think you ought totell Strachan. I think --PRESIDENT:No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Tell Keogh heought to ask for the resignation.DEAN:I think Bob ought to do that, though.PRESIDENT:Bob Haldeman? DEAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:Good. I'll tell him; I'll tell Bob then toget them. That'll, that'll be Strachan and, uh, Magruder coming up. That&#8482;ll be it.DEAN:All right, sir.PRESIDENT:All right. That&#8482;s your, your advice. Oh,also if you do have any random thoughts on, uh, how many more we could do on thepresentation of this thing, sit over in youroffice and think of it, I mean, as to how to handle the --DEAN:Well, I want you to --PRESIDENT:So that the President is in front, you knowwhat I mean.DEAN:I want, I want, I want to give you some,some notes on that, that I think will help.-53-PRESIDENT:Would you do that?DEAN:Yes sir. I will. PRESIDENT:The record. Here's what I&#8482;ve done. Here'swhat I've done, and what you think thePresident ought to do and when--you see whatI mean? And then, if we have to use these things -I pray to God we don't, 'cause youguys don&#8482;t deserve it. You don't deserveit.DEAN:Well, at least, the important thing is thatit's not them, it's you.PRESIDENT:No, well, I know, maybe it isn't mepersonally, it's this place.DEAN:Well, it's the Office, and, uh, the campaignoffice as well.PRESIDENT:All right. Remember, be back. DEAN:All right, sir. PRESIDENT:I would, uh, I&#8482;d just, just, just hangtightly.DEAN:I couldn't, I couldn&#8482;t be, PRESIDENT:Hang tightly. DEAN:I couldn&#8482;t be more objective, Mr. President.And, you-54-know, I just have &#338;don&#8482;t think I've lost myobjectivity in this thing at all.PRESIDENT:What? DEAN:I said, don't think I&#8482;ve lost my objectivityat all in this,PRESIDENT:Right. DEAN:even though I&#8482;m right at the peak on it.All right, sir.PRESIDENT:Good enough.-55-
