And thenDean said, "The reason for this meeting this morning, is that you don't really know what I know, so it's difficult for you to makejudgments. And, uh, he said, "Overallthere's-no doubt about the seriousness of all this. There's a cancer close to thePresidency. It's growing daily; it'scompounding itself. We&#8482;re being blackmailed. People are going to start perjuring to protect others and there's no assurance itisn&#8482;t all gonna bust. And, let's face it.First, let me fill you in on the Watergate.&#64258; Then he went back to the beginning, went through the whole thing on how it cameabout.PRESIDENT:Right.

I think Strachan did know.Bob knew there was a capacity.&#64258; He says,(unintelligible with tape noise) seventeenth he says, "I was under instructions, under their instructions not to investigate. Weworked on the theory of containment. Weknew everything the FBI did and everything the Grand Jury did and I have-Petersen&#8482;s asoldier, he kept me informed of the leads(unintelligible) in this Administration. He made-sure the investigation was narrowed and there was nothing improper-about it, andthey ran out each lead to the fullest extentand they kept" (unintelligible) But you said, "Why didn&#8482;t they call Haldeman?&#64258; Dean said, "There was no reason for calling-him,"he, said. He said, "Strachan appeared, as aresult of coaching, to be the dumbest guy on the Committee.&#64258; That's Gordon Strachan.(Tape noise) -"the demands for attorneys&#8482;fees. You're asking us, to take this, uh, through the election, so, uh, you gotta have money to take care of other kinds and allthat. So arrangements were made throughMitchell and I was present. I, Dean was present. They had to be taken care of andtheir needs done and all that(unintelligible) operates cash. Some of it went to Hunt&#8482;s lawyer. His wife was taking money to a Cuban when her plane was shotdown.&#64258;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.4PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:--says (tape noise) &#64257;It&#8482;s the first time Iheard that"PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:(unintelligible) &#64257;is involved and Ehrlichmanis, I am, and Mitchell is, That&#8482;sobstruction of justice. And you said, &#64257;How is Haldeman involved?&#64258; He said, &#64257;We ran out of money and borrowed that three fifty inthe safe for polling and so they came hereand I went to Haldeman and Haldeman said, &#64257;What&#8482;s it for?&#64258; And I told him, and uh, we&#352;as you know we had decided that there is noprice too high to pay and blow it before the election. Now see, I told him none of that money was taken out until after the electionSo that&#8482;s a,...PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...a point we gotta find out. Uh, he says&#64257;Now there&#8482;ll be continual blackmail byHunt, Liddy and McCord. Colson had talkedindirectly to Hunt about commutation, Blackmail is continuing. Hunt called hislawyer, O&#8482;Brien at CREEP Friday. The lawyercame to me. Hunt was demanding seventy-two thousand for personal money and fifty thousand for attorneys&#8482; fees and he said hehad to have it by the close of businessyesterday;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.5HALDEMAN:that he was trying to get his(CONTINUED)affairs in order because he&#8482;s gonna besentenced on Friday. This was on Wednesday.I told O&#8482;Brien he came to the wrong man. I&#8482;m not&#8211; I&#8482;m not involved with money. I don&#8482;tknow a thing about it and I can&#8482;t help you.&#64258;And he said, &#64257;O&#8482;Brien is a great ball player. He&#8482;s completely safe and no problem. Hunt made a direct threat against Ehrlichmanfor blackmail&#64258; He said, &#64257;I&#8482;ll bringEhrlichman to his knees and put him in jail on Ellsberg and other. It depends on whatare the soft points the Cuban(unintelligible) that, that Hunt...&#64258;PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:"These were the same people that Hunt andLiddy used in the California break-in. So,so, they knew about&#352;-Hunt and Liddy are (unintelligible) around the White House.&#64258; And you asked, &#64257;Why it was done.&#64258; He said,&#64257;I don&#8482;t know,&#64258; He said, &#64257;There are a coupleof things here I&#8482;ve gotten into. At one time there was a second-story job on Brookings,&#64258;which I didn&#8482;t know about. &#64257;And I was toldEhrlichman had instructed and I checked with him and he said he didn&#8482;t know anything about it and to turn if off. And I did(unintelligible). He knows, uh, &#64257;he said&#64258;,who knows about all this.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.6HALDEMAN:The Cubans' lawyer, Rothblatt, who's(CONTINUED)a no-good son-of-a-bitch. F. Lee Bailey whocame in to cool Rothblatt down.(Unintelligible) Bittman, O&#8482;Brien, and Parkinson. They&#8482;re solid but they know. Thenall of the principals and some of the wives(unintelligible tape noise).&#64258; You said, &#64257;Someone did raise the question of me and Hunt&#8482;s commutation.&#64258; And I just said, &#64257;You&#352;you got terribly upset about that(unintelligible) but obviously it&#8482;s a serious problem, to the extent of &#64257;Deansaid, &#64257;That&#8482;s the extent of my knowledge.&#64258;He said that, &#64257;In soft spots there&#8482;s one continuing blackmail. Not just now when they&#8482;re in prison, but, ah, not just now butwhen they get to prison, they&#8482;re gonna keepon with this and they compound the obstruction of justice problem and it&#8482;ll cost money. You know, people here aren&#8482;tpros, they don&#8482;t know how to do this kind ofthing.&#64258; You said, &#64257;Well, maybe we can&#8482;t do it.&#64258; Dean said, &#64257;That&#8482;s right, plus the,it&#8482;s the problem of raising money.&#64258; He said,&#64257;Mitchell&#8482;s working on the money. There&#8482;s no denying that Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Dean are involved in the early fund raising.&#64258;You said, &#64257;How much money is involved inthis.&#64258; &#64257;If we need the money we can get the money. We can get it in cash. I know whereit could be gotten but the question is whocan handle it?&#64258; Dean said, &#64257;That&#8482;s right.&#64258; &#338; And, Dean then said, &#64257;Mitchell should be charged with that. And he ought to get somepros to help him. He has LaRue getting itnow and I told him, &#8218;That, that&#8482;s awful.&#8482;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.7HALDEMAN:He's also talked to Pappas&#64258; You(CONTINUED)said, "I know.&#64258; He said Pappas hasapparently agreed to help.PRESIDENT:I said? HALDEMAN:You said, "I know.&#64258; Then you said, "Justthinking out loud here, would you put itthrough the Cuban Committee?&#64258; Dean said, "No.&#64258; And you said, "Well, it, it would be in cash. Is the Cuban Committee--some ofthis would be in cash-- Is the CubanCommittee involved in obstruction of justice? Wouldn&#8482;t that give it cover?&#64258; Deansaid, &#64257;Well, we need some for the Cubans andsome for Hunt and then we have Liddy and McCord doesn&#8482;t want one and he&#8482;s not a bought man right now.&#64258; Now that, sort offinished the subject there and he got intothe growing cancer business and you said, &#64257;What do you mean?&#64258; He said, &#64257;Well, McCord would, -- Krogh perjured himself before theGrand Jury. He&#8482;s haunted by it and went intothat. Mitchell and Magruder have potential perjuries and there&#8482;s a possibility of anyindividual blowing things (unintelligible).&#64258;Then you said, &#64257;Your major one to control is Hunt because he knows so much.&#64258; He said, &#64257;Right. He keeps saying Colson--he thinksColson abandoned him because he tried to seehim about money and Colson wouldn&#8482;t talk to him about money&#64258; and so on. And you said,&#64257;Looking at the immediate problem, don&#8482;t youhave to handle Hunt&#8482;s financial situation?&#64258; And Dean said, &#64257;I talked to Mitchell about that last night.&#64258;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.8HALDEMAN:And you said," We've got to keep the cap(CONTINUED)on the bottle that much, at least." Deansaid," That&#8482;s right.&#64258; You said, Either thator let it all blow right now,&#64258; Then Dean said,&#64258; That&#8482;s the question.&#64258; Then you gotinto the Kalmbach thing. Dean explainedabout the one twenty-seven million Kalmbach had in boxes. Said he&#8482;d spent a lot of it. Thisis fascinating because I didn`t know anyof this. He spent a good deal since &#8482;69.Five hundred thousand for private polling; four hundred thousand for the South foranother candidate. That wasn&#8482;t for Wallace,it was for the guy who ran against Wallace.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) for the guy who ran againsthim in 70. He mentioned Tony who did theChappaquiddick study. You said, "I heard about that. "And he said-- and you said, that, "There&#8482;s nothing illegal" orsomething. Dean said, "No, nothing illegal,but it was explosive." He said, " I don't know anything illegal where Kalmbach did itexcept that he won't, blow the whistle onpeople and that therefore he may get himself into perjury." Now for example, I asked him about Segretti and where he'd get the cash.And you said, "How do we handle that?" AndDean, said, &#64257; Well, it doesn't bother me, there`s no crime there, it's justpolitically embarassing. Other,vulnerabilities, that runaway Grand Jury in New York on Mitchell and Stans &#64257; Ehrlichman thinks--APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.9HALDEMAN:he says," They're gonna try and grabEhrlichman(CONTINUED)(unintelligible) and, uh, Ehrlichman mayhave to appear at that Grand Jury.&#64258; You said, "Would he have privilege?&#64258; He said,"No there's no privileged information.&#64258;PRESIDENT:I said or he did? HALDEMAN:You said, "he would have privilege.&#64258; Deansaid, "No.&#64258; Then he &t into the Segrettithing and, and same stuff that you alreadyhave--that Haldeman did authorize .it and the potential felony charge for Chapin. Thereal problem is that&#352;-I&#8482;m not too concernedabout that, it's the problem on the PR side, but that's all. He said, "Well, the real problem is the growing situation of supportfor the Watergate people and the need forsome people to perjure themselves. If this ever blows and we&#8482;re in a cover-up situation, it'll be extremely damaging toyou. For example, if it starts breaking andthey find a criminal case against Haldeman, uh, Dean, Mitchell, or Ehrlichman." Yousaid, "Coming down to that fact we cannottake the heat. We have to share it--we have to shave it a little." I think that's what it boils down to. (Unintelligible).APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.10HALDEMAN:"Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Mitchell and I(CONTINUED)should sit down and spend a day or howeverlong to figure it out. And, uh, try tofigure how to carve this away from you so that it doesn't, uh, (tape noise) you or thePresidency, damage you or the Presidency,and, uh, (unintelligible) I just don't know about this but it's obvious, I know from our conversations that, uh, these are thingsthat you had no knowledge of.&#64258; And, uh, yousaid, "The triggerman was Colson on this" and Dean said, "Well, he was just in a chainof command. And, and uh, the problem is,will this break some day with a domino situation? For instance, Haldeman will be accused of things that he never heard of,and the President will be hurt from those."Dean said, "I am not confident we can ride through this. There are soft spots--everybody looking out for himself andgetting counsel, worried or hopingfor along time but (unintelligible) by the Gray thing getting me on the front pages."PRESIDENT:Mmm.HALDERAN:"Suppose you and Haldeman and Ehrlichman andMitchell put out a full disclosure." Dean said, "Well, that's one way." And, uh, thenyou said--then he said," And we can have thePresident tell the Attorney General he wants, another Grand Jury. And, uh, putthat out to avoid criminal liability formany people and a minimum for the rest by thinking through the immunity question." And, you said you might tell Magrudersomething. He said, "Yeah, but some ofthem will have to go to jail.&#64258;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.11HALDEMAN:You said," Who? Let's talk about that."(CONTINUED)Dean said, " I think I would, for one." Yousaid, "Oh, no, no!&#64258; Dean said, "Yeah." Ican see people starting to point the finger on the obstruction of justice." You said."You were just doing it as counsel. We cancut it off at the pass." Dean said, &#64257;I think that proper coordination with the Department of Justice', maybe we could.Petersen is the only one I know that'sbright enough to advise us, to put together- -put this together with maximum separationfor the President and minumum damage to theindividuals. I have faith in him. Ah, I have just been the conduit of information, taking care of people who are guilty ofcrimes and that's, what they're getting onobstruction of justice, that's how they're getting-I was a conduit taking care of people who were guilty of crimes."(Unintelligible). Then you said, "Supposeyou got the money and had a way to handle it. It would seem to me that would beworthwhile but we'd still have the problemof Hunt's clemency." Dean said, "Right. And the others-It may be untenable. I'm not sure you can deliver on clemency." And yousaid, "Not before the '74 election forsure." He said, &#64257;It may involve-it may further involve you in this," and you said,"Yes, and it's wrong.&#64258;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.12HALDEMAN:Dean said, "There have been some bad(CONTINUED)judgements made and some necessaryjudgements made before the election, but wecan't burden the second administration, with something that won't go away." It has to be(unintelligible) you said &#64257;Who else(unintelligible) would have criminal problems?" Dean said, "Ehrlichman. On a conspiracy to bug Ellsberg--to burglarizeEllsberg's doctor.&#64258; He said," Ya know,there's a picture in the files."PRESIDENT:I didn't know about that. All right.(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:"It's embarassing...that's gonna come outsome time and, uh, then, there's the question why there was a phone in the WhiteHouse in the secretary's name and, uh, Ihave a plan but, uh, you should, uh, think in terms of how to cut the losses and not futher compound them.&#64258; And then; you saidthat, "At the moment don't you agree webetter take care of the Hunt thing?"PRESIDENT:Yeah, well, I--HALDEMAN:"Ehrlichman and Haldeman have met with me,but they've never met with Mitchell&#64258;, I and he said, "Haldeman has a potential criminal liability (unintelligible). Uh, he's...maybe indicted but might not be convicted&#64258;.The President said, &#64257;If they re gonna be indicted, it's better to tough it through&#352;cut our losses so if it blows, we&#8482;ll neverrecover.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.13HALDEMAN:So we'll have to cut it out with no one(CONTINUED)testifying. You got to realize the weaknesson the blackmail. "Dean said, "What we needto do is get you up and out and away from it. Or else hunker down and fight it atevery turn and hope we can do, it(unintelligible)." You said, "Still consider this point of briefing the Cabinet, the leaders and so on on my investigation."Dean said, "If we go there, we'll have togive (unintelligible).&#64258; You said, "The most difficult problems are the guys going tojail and clemency. How long will they sittight?" You said, "Have a meeting fast, today.&#64258; He said, "We can't. Mitchell's not here." You said, "Tomorrow."Dean said," Hunt,-Haldeman and Ehrlichmandon't want to talk to Mitchell. Haldeman agrees that you, you should have the facts and wanted me to talk to you." Somewhere atthat point, I think, I can't tell on thetape, but it's obvious because I talked with him (unintelligible), We can charge themwith blackmailing us. He said, "I talked toEhrlichman, he's gotta get away from this. But he recommends a meeting at the earliest time.&#64258; Then you pushed for a meeting withHaldeman and Mitchell. You said," I don't."You said, "I don't want to go over there. You decide and let me know. You tell them,exactly what you told me about theobstruction and then see what the line-is, whether we stonewall it or whether we take the heat. If it's stonewall and take theheat or we can analyze the vulnerablepoints, especially Hunt.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.14HALDEMAN:Thequestion of whether Hunt'll blow the(CONTINUED)whistle." And you said to me, "The pointis all the secretaries and so on,"--Youstarted explaining to me, other words, (unintelligible) problem. Then, uh, (tapenoise) me for the first time about theColson-Magruder phone call. I was kind of surprised about that. You said," The Hunt problem is serious because of Ellsberg."Dean said, "Well, we can put that on aNational Security basis. But then they'll say why didn't the CIA or FBI do it, I and Isaid, "Because we were checking them.&#64258; And,uh, Deansaid, "Well, we could probably get by on that that solves the Krogh, Krogh pro-problem, that, thatthere was treasoninvolved here. That's what they'reinvestigating." Yousaid, "We must have a talk with Mitchell. The cut off point is that a possibility it still could be Liddybecause that's where we are now and that'sall we know at this point. But that requires--if, if Magruder is lying--itwould require continued perjury byMagruder.&#64258; And Dean then said to me, this is the first I was there,"Hunt's playing hard ball with us&#64258; I said, "what, what,what about? Money?" Dean said, "Yeah."You said, &#64257;Yeah. A hundred and twenty thousand dollars.&#64258; You said "That's' easyto get, but its' not easy to deliver. Andtrying to cut our losses won&#8482;t work. We have to look what they are and avoid criminal liability&#64258;.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.15PRESIDENT:I said that?HALDEMAN:Uh, huh. And you said," Well, there'sanother way, but it would require a milliondollars to take care of the defendants. But then they&#8482;ll crack after we're gone,anyway. You can't deliver on clemency andColson's promises. Hunt's talking about being out by Christmas.&#64258; Then he reported the thing about Kleindienst takes control ofthe Parole Board now he says, "We candeliver on parole."Whether we'll still be able to--special parole. Dean said, "Ourgreatest jeopardy is paying the blackmail."You said, &#64257;We can get the dollars. There's no problem with that, but we can't provide the clemency." And I said," I don't see anyway the White House or anyone in the WhiteHouse can be involved in trying to get Hunt the money.&#64258; And Dean said," Well, we're already deeply involved in that, that's theproblem." And, uh, then he got into thatwhen they ran out of the Kalmbach money they got the three fifty and I said," That wassimply moved where it belonged." And Deansaid, "Every time we ask for, ya know, we've-had to get Strachan go to the safe and take it to LaRue, which, would have been aforever operation." And, uh, you said,&#64257;Back to the money. The ways to get it. (Pause). The hell with the million (tapenoise) it's all off.&#64258; But I mean you made(unintelligible).APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.16HALDEMAN:"So let it go. Then blow the whistle(CONTINUED)and, uh, (unintelligible) is that yourrecommendation?&#64258; Dean said, No, notnecessarily. It's better to get our story before the Grand Jury and let theminvestigate the White House. But I haven'tthought that through.&#64258; That's where I quit because I, I figured I had enough and better get over here. Uh, because...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...Apparently, some more on there is, thereis, uh, I would say that confirms yourrecollection pretty much the way you saidit--the way you recalled it. And then, I don't really see a need (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Really?HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:Well, I say though that, well(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:...we can get the moneyPRESIDENT:...we can get the moneyHALDEMAN:Okay. But you didn&#8482;t do it and we&#8482;redrawing him out on the question of what,what&#8482;s in the box.PRESIDENT:Money, what could we do with it? You getthe money, how do ya deliver it? Yeah.HALDEMAN:That's...PRESIDENT:...that really (unintelligible).APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.17HALDEMAN:Okay. You're drawing Dean out on what he&#8482;stalking about here.PRESIDENT:You have to know exactly what he has.HALDEMAN:And the conclusion, in fact, was, don't doit. You can't do it.PRESIDENT:It&#8482;s not a good story, best we can...HALDEMAN:He raises a lot of, a lot of new stuff.That's it.PRESIDENT:Well. The new stuff...HALDEMAN:It's interesting. He's told you a differentstory than he's told to me.PRESIDENT:Well, (unintelligible). I said, well,that's-we gotta keep the cap on it. We canget the money, huh? But I said...HALDEMAN:Ya see, you're trying it out. PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:You re trying to: see how far it goes. Yousaid, "Is that your recommendation?&#64258; That's, you do that all the time. You ask people questions on the basis of--, to tryand see what direction they&#8482;re going.That's...they're leading questions. But it doesn&#8482;t mean that your statement is(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I said a million dollars. With a milliondollars (unintelligible) clemency. You couldn't do it till after the &#8218;74,eledtions.That's an incriminating thing.

HALDEMAN:You just want the Hunt part of it? PRESIDENT:Yep.HALDEMAN:Okay. "(Unintelligible). O'Brien came tome.

I'mnot involved in money and I don't now athing about it and I can't help you.&#64258; Dean states O'Brien's a great ball player(unintelligible).APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.19PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:He made a direct threat against Ehrlichman.Hunt said, "I'll bring Ehrlichman to hisknees, put him in jail.&#64258; Ellsberg and other events, seamy things (unintelligible) theydid (unintelligible) extent they wereinvolved in, soft spots. He said, "The first one is a continuing blackmailPRESIDENT:All right.HALDEMAN:"...Not just now but when they're in prisonand so on. So they compound the obstruction of justice problem and it'll, it'll cost alot of money.

I know whereit could be gotten but the question is whocan handle it.&#64258; He said, "That's right."(tape noise) He said, &#64257;Mitchell should be charged with that responsibilityand get some pros to help him. He has LaRueout getting it. I-told him that's awful. He's also talked to Pappas.&#64258; You said, &#64257;Iknow.&#64258; He said, &#64257;Pappas, has agreed tohelp." &#64257;Just thinking out loud here, would you put it through the Cuban Committee?"

You said, "You got to keep thecap on the bottle that much causeit's"--Dean ,.said, "That's right.&#64258; You said, Either that or let it all blow right now.&#64258; Dean said, "That's the question."PRESIDENT:That's not a bad line for me at that point,is it? Political or is it gonna come down.HALDEMAN:I don't think so. You're smoking him out onwhat he thinks the alternatives are.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:You're pumping him. PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.21HALDEMAN:As you did on other things here,-in thesevarious things you would say to well, youknow, "What would you do about this andwhat, where would you go on that?&#64258; Then they got to the attempt (unintelligible),"Suppose you got the money and the way tohandle things. It would seem to me that would be worthwhile.&#64258; You said, &#64257;We'd have a problem with Hunt's clemency.""(Unintelligible) and the others maybe(unintelligible) and the others that may be untenable. I'm not sure you can deliver onclemency.&#64258; You said, &#64257;Not before the '74election for sure.&#64258; Dean said," It may further involve you.&#64258; You said," Yes, and it would be,--then it's wrong."PRESIDENT:That's not bad.HALDEMAN:Dean said "There've been some bad judgementsmade and some necessary judgements made before the election, but you can't burdenthe second administration with somethingthat won t go away. There has to be-&#64257; And you said, &#64257;Well, who else is a potentialcriminal?&#64258; Dean said &#64257;You know I don't havea plan but we should think in terms of how to cut the losses and not further compound.them.&#64258; You said, "At the moment,don&#8482;t you agree we better take care of theHunt thing.(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible with tape noise) it was justsort of lobbed in...(Tape noise).APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.22HALDEMAN:...to the point of setting up a(CONTINUED)meeting with Ehrlichman (unintelligible)with Mitchell. (Tape noise). I think youwanted to analyze the vulnerable points such as Hunt, the problem of whether Hunt wouldblow the whistle. Dean told me about thefact that Hunt had been a problem because of this--PRESIDENT:National Security.HALDEMAN:Well, uh, you say, you say the Hunt problemis serious because of Ellsberg. And the effect on our National Security.HALDEMAN;(Unintelilgible Tape Noise) hard hall withus" and I said," What? What about, money?&#64258; and you said," Yes: 120,000, which is easy to get, but-,it's not easy to deliver. Wehave to try to cut our losses but it won'twork, so we have to look at what they are to avoid criminal liability.&#64258; (Tape Noise) I, I oughta go back and get your verbatimpoints. These are--my desk&#352;It&#8482;s hard ashell to get you on this thing.PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:(unintelligible with tape noise)&#64258;wouldrequire a million dollars to take care of the defendants, but they'll crack after we&#8482;re gone.&#64258;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.23PRESIDENT:I said that?HALDEMAN:Um hmm. And then there was some discussionabout, you know, yeah, but, but then Deansaid that was, that would be history but it wouldn't affect us directly or something.And, uh, (tape noise) be said somethingabout we can't deliver on clemency. Colson's been dropping promises. Dean said," Yeah, Hunt's talking about being out byChristmas.&#64258; (Unintelligible) Then they gotinto a parole discussion.PRESIDENT:Kleindienst to give parole, right?HALDUIAN:And then, uh, he came back with, "Ourgreatest jeopardy is, is uh, the thing is blackmail.&#64258; You said, " We can, you get the dollars. We can get the money. There&#8482;s noproblem with that. But we can't deliver onclemency.&#64258; I said," I don't see any way the White House or anyone in the White House can (unintelligible)." He said,(unintelligible). I think there's probablymore. I think we went back over it again. We got more into the thing of, "But we can'tdo it, that it isn't right,(unintelligible).&#64258; I recall more discussion when I was there of the thing of it being-, that we can&#8482;t get into this kind of aposition. (Unintelligible) a position andbesides that it was National Security. It seems to me that there was more discussionand (unintelligible) but it isn't-APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.24PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:If it is, it isn't (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:The are many questions based on that. Hecan say that the President discussed we gotta keep the cap on the bottle, we gottatake care of Hunt.HALDEMAN:Well, I'd say, it was because PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) how do we deliver themoney? Clemency not before '74? That's thevulnerable point.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) your position... PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible with tape noise) the factthat it never happened.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible with tape noise) drawing himout, that you made notes, steps on this. That you were also concerned, you weretrying to winnow that one out because therewas, there were factors in it that Dean didn't know anything about as this conversation indicates, about the NationalSecurity. (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:That's-you may be pushing him there to findout whether he has set up a system ofdelivery and all that, which he didn&#8482;t.PRESIDENT:What I'm really setting up there, puttingthe best light on a on a bad situation, isbasic, basically I&#8482;m saying, &#64257;Well, getthe money, but uh, we should try to cut it off and so forth- but how do you do it?"APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.25HALDEMAN:You're being blackmailed, here on this.specific question of, of the NationalSecurity point. Because what Hunt washolding ya up on, was not on the Watergate.PRESIDENT:Still, still-HALDEMAN:But, but on the other, seamy work forEhrlichman. All the other defendants were also involved in this.PRESIDENT:Is time (unintelligible) big pressure?HALDEMAN:Yeah. I don't think I think he's spinningout what, what he thinks Dean is looking at as his hole card.PRESIDENT:Kleindienst came-.over today (noise) and,uh, this memorandum he gave me...(Unintelligible) And I authorized him to, uh, pass that ahead pass it to thejudge, uh, cause (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:That was Wednesday. You met with him&#352;thatwas Wednesday morning. You met with himagain early afternoon in here with Mitchell, and Ehrlichman...APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.26PRESIDENT:I know that.HALDEMAN:...and then later in the afternoon withEhrlichman.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:Then I think you met with him Thursday, thenext day, before then you went to KeyBiscayne Thursday night. I'll have to check the log. I'm not sure if Dean went with him Thursday or not, but as I recall, I think hedid.PRESIDENT:(Tape noise) back here who had theconversation with Mitchell on the money.HALDEMAN:Yeah, it --really isn't a conversation withMitchell on the money.PRESIDENT:Well. HALDEMAN:There was a conversation between Mitchelland Dean that we assumed was on, on themoney, and, and we assumed (unintelligible) because we didn't say it there was I something we didn't want to get into.(Unintelligible) said, "Listen, I guess it'staken care of. There's no problem there. I guess, it's worked out. I guess it's okay&#64258;,something to that effect. And, uh, the bigquestion was, "Did you pay him the money, or didn&#8482;t you pay him, or are you going to, or is someone else paying him, or did you tellhim to go to hell or what?&#64258;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.27PRESIDENT:The matter was my trying to get the facts,the truth, and that's the (unintelligible).Call in John, telling me for the first time(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:You're, you&#8482;re probingPRESIDENT:Right here, I&#8482;m interested in a cost, right?HALDEMAN:You (unintelligible), you never said thisis, you, you asked leading questions. You nev--, you said, well, we can get the money,that's no problem. You just see,(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well,-but I said we oughta, uh, at least weought to take care of that, didn't I saythat though?HALDEMAN:Yeah, but that was to lead him on into thequestion of how to handle the money. And hedidn't buy. He said," I don't know. Youought to get busy on-if you gonna do that Mitchell ought to take care of it.' Which is kind of interesting. You were trying tosmoke out whether Dean knew how to handlemoney. And was involved in this payoff stuff and it was clear he wasn't. He didn'tknow didn't give you any answer to thequestion, said," You ought to-that Mitchell ought to do that, get some pros to handle it.&#64258;APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.28HALDEMAN:Now, I think I'll find later in(CONTINUED)this thing, because I think I recall when Iwas there, a discussion of that where Deanwas saying," No, our people don&#8482;t know how to wash money, get it all worked out," andall that, and, uh, I think that will come upagain, where you push him.PRESIDENT:I may have said later (unintelligible) dowhat you can on it.HALDEMAN:Well, you may be, may be dead--I don't thinkyou did.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.29PRESIDENT:You were there (unintelligible) that day(unintelligible). You were there the restof that day.HALDEMAN:(Tape noise) that morning. PRESIDENT:My recollection's fairly clear on that(unintelligible).HALDEMAN;Let me tell you one--maybe bothersome thingin that, I checked this (unintelligible) the tape works the in here (tape noise). In thelog, when the four of us met in here, withyou, Dean and Mitchell were in for five minutes longer than Ehrlichman and I were.PRESIDENT:Yeah. That was when we discussed(unintelligible). I, uh, discussed money with Mitchell, never.HALDEMAN:Okay.PRESIDENT:Don't worry about that log?HALDEMAN:The only other time... PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:...because at that point, Dean would havefelt, I'm sure that, the problem no longerexisted because of the conversation he had with Mitchell--(unintelligible-tape noise)on the a meeting in the evening, late in theday, with Ehrlichman, Dean, -and me in here, that something was said about--with that being, as much on your mind as it was in themorning I, I can't imagine that you didn'tdo something to follow up on it. Because you wouldn&#8482;t, you, you wouldn't just letsomething like that drop. You'd had to havesatisfied yourself in some way that something was happening on that.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.30PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:It probably is, if you didn't raise it withMitchell and Dean, you probably raised itwith Ehrlichman, Dean and me and one of us probably said that Mitchell said somethingthis morning about it, and...PRESIDENT:Yes, I... HALDEMAN:...I think that's no problem or somethinglike that.PRESIDENT:So that's that.HALDEMAN:That's it. PRESIDENT:...You think he'll say that--that we wereaware of it? (unintelligible-tape noise).HALDEMAN:At that point, you're trying to bust thecase. You're not worrying about individual acts, at that point in time. You're tryingto open up what the hell's going on here.And you don't know whether to believe this guy at this point. You're starting to wonder.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Some of some of these stories... PRESIDENT:Like...HALDEMAN:...some of these stories don&#8482;t check. Hetells you Krogh's worried about perjury, Ehrlichman tells you Krogh flaty says he didn&#8482;t perjure himself and has no concernabout it at all.PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s quite, quite true at this point toothat, uh, we discussed the, the moneysituation, raising the money(unintelligible). I said, &#64257;That&#8482;s wrong, didn't I? Oh, wrong on clemency.HALDEMAN:No, you said getting, the money was wrong.PRESIDENT:Hmm?APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.31HALDEMAN:You said that, that approach would bewrong...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...trying to get the money. No, because Idon't think you felt that clemency waswrong. I think you felt that you had somejustification for clemency on Hunt.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:Because of his family, and he then, actuallyyou'd talked about it for all of thembecause, because the people, they really are being screwed...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...on an equity basis. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) you can't move in onimmediate clemency. You probably may not beable to do it. But in clemency there can be compassion, not, not concern with with cover-up.PRESIDENT:Also say, we can say we considered it,talked about,-said (unintelligible) it just won't work. (Unintelligible-with tapenoise). We didn't furnish any money, thankGod.HALDEMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:Remember I told you later that I could get a100,000?HALDEMAN:That makes&#352;-that rings a bell &#64257;cause youtalked about Rose having some money or--something. I remember that.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible with tape noise) HALDEMAN:You didn't know what kind of a-be had toldyou that Mitchell had been working up thisprogram with of, uh, financial support forthose people. You didn't know what that was. At that point you didn't know whetherAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.32HALDEMAN:Mitchell was involved. He flatly says(CONTINUED)here--in this report to you, he isn'tconvinced that Mitchell was involved yet. orat least doesn't say so.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Hunt is blackmailing me andEhrlichman (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) that said, "screw him." PRESIDENT:He went to see Ehrlichman after this. HALDEMAN:Before (tape noise) the threat came in theFriday preceding, this was a Wednesday, anduh, the due date was the night preceding, the Tuesday night preceding I imagine thetalk (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Show Ehrlichman that memorandum fromKleindienst, and say we had no choice under the circumstances.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible),PRESIDENT:Oh, Mitchell, I mean (unintelligible) or theprosecutor in this-has had nothing from this break-in was made available. The prosector(unintelligible). Dean, see, informed themof the Ellsberg break-in.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) Petersen.PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) prosecution. It&#8482;ll breakin the paper, it&#8482;ll say that&#8482;ll clearEllsberg, Watergate buggers, tried to dothis or that and the other thing. Know what I mean? This is the only proper thing todo; John he disagrees. And I&#352;Kleindienstasked me. I said there&#8482;s no choice there.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.33(Unintelligible with tape noise),PRESIDENT:How about immunity for Dean.HALDEMAN:I don&#8482;t think he can do it.(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:He's going to come in to see him. Accordingto Kleindienst, he's gonna see, uh. (tapenoise).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) no sir. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) I'm not trying, you can'tdeal with the guy, I don't think, if he's ifworse. I think he's playing this game. He may not be.PRESIDENT:Yes.HALDEMAN:If he's not playing this game, then PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible with tape noise). HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible with tape noise).PRESIDENT:Yeah, with John, not you. (Unintelligiblewith tape noise) blackmail (unintelligible) its a possibility. I would say it's wrong.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)you get the money. You doall that. Where does it lead you? (Unintelligible). Petersen&#8482;s honorable.HALDEMAN:If he's honorable...APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.34PRESIDENT:Petersen? Petersen&#8482;s (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) Agnew for Vice President.Even your worst enemies don't want to dothat.PRESIDENT:Well, yeah. (Unintelligible with tapenoise).HALDEMAN:John is only raising that as a, as anoutside possibility, that's something he just spun out last night, I hadn't heard hisstory on that.PRESIDENT:Well, gotta look at it as a possibility.What Dean's up to.HALDEMAN:it's not been something (unintelligible). Ithink, he's just looking at the, at the worst...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...that could come out of that end, and Ithink it was, was, uh, in the process, also trying to bring home the point that we...PRESIDENT:...that the sacking of Ehrlichman, Haldemanain't gonna do the trick.HALDEMAN:Well that's right. PRESIDENT:That's really true.HALDEMAN:Yeah, not from a point of self-defense.PRESIDENT:Absolutely.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.35HALDEMAN:We're prepared to do it, to go out on thesword if it's the right thing to do. Butlacking the conviction that it's the rightthing to do we&#8482;re, we&#8482;re, I'm sure you're gonna argue the-I'm sure the point toconsider, the other wayPRESIDENT:Let's not drag up (unintelligible) thewagons up around the White House. Let me say it's got to be you, Ehrlichman, and Ihave got to put the wagons up around thePresident on this particular conversation. I just wonder if the son-of-a-bitch had arecorder on him. (Tape noise). I didn'tnotice any but I wasn't looking (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:It's almost inconceivable that the guy wouldtry that because...PRESIDENT:He was really coming in, in fact, to warnme.HALDEMAN:Yeah. He wasn't coming in, wasn't coming infor the purpose of...PRESIDENT:At that point, he hadn't made the commanddecision to, uh...HALDEMAN:He had no thought that you were going to sayanything like this. All he was coming in to tell you was that there was a problem. He wasn't expecting you to solve it, uh, uh, tosolve it, that way. I think you probablysurprised him enormously by, by even raising this point. And I think that is a...APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 4:40 P.M., TO 5:30 P.M.36PRESIDENT:What, what?HALDEMAN:Of, you know, well, we could get the money.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN;I think that's the last thing he expectedyou to say.PRESIDENT:What did he'd expect me to say, we can&#8482;t doit?HALDEMAN:What he expected you to say was well, that'san indication of another part of theproblem, isn't it? He was just trying topoint, he was logging, and you look at the course of this conversation, he went fromthat point to other points, he was loggingall the problems, we have, the soft spots. And they were things like Krogh, like the 350, and like this and like that, and thiswas one of them.TOM HART:Excuse me, Mr. President, Mr. Petersen sacross the street. Did you want to see him here or over at the Oval Office?PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) going across, I&#8482;m going totake a hard line on clemency.HALDEMAN:Yeah. I don't think he'll raise thesubject.PRESIDENT:You don&#8482;t think he will? HALDEMAN:I don&#8482;t think he's gonna (unintelligible).I don&#8482;t (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Oh, I think Dean&#8218;s Dean&#8482;stold him, or outlined it.HALDEMAN:Could be, but I doubt it.
