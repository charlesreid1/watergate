EHRLICHMAN:Yes sir.PRESIDENT:I wanted you to know that I just talked toKleindienst and told him that I wanted him to tell the prosecutor Neison (phonetic) or Nesson (phonetic)...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...or whatever his name is is and, uh, that,that, and, uh, Kleindiensttotally agreedthat this was--I wanted him to know thatthis was a national security investigation of great sensitivity and that I, that none of the information had been there but wasonly presented just so that they would haveit in their file and that I would, you know, I said do everything you can to, uh, to see that this is not something that comes outpublicly.EHRLICHMAN:Great. PRESIDENT:At least I, I don't know whether it'll workor not, but...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, that's terrific. PRESIDENT:I don't know whether it's terrific or not. EHRLICHMAN:Well, it's the best that can be done.PRESIDENT:But, uh, you can see, see why, oh, you couldsay that the lawyer was having a gun at their head.EHRLICHMAN:Sure, sure.PRESIDENT:I think he had. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. I understand.APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:25 TO 7:39 P.M.2PRESIDENT:I think he put it out there solely for thepurpose of, uh--Petersen told-me, he says,"I think he put it out there for the purposeof, uh, frankly blackmailing, uh, Henry Petersen and, uh, frankly maybe, uh, theWhite House."EHRLICHMAN:Hmm. Interesting. Well, then the bestthing to do...PRESIDENT:What do you think?EHRLICHMAN:...is what you did, the very best thing.PRESIDENT:We are not gonna have any blackmail. EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:And, uh...EHRLICHMAN:Did he give you any sort of a reading on,uh, timing on Dean?PRESIDENT:God damn he doesn't know. I uh, I uh, I,he's pushing...EHRLICHMAN:I can see why if they're playing that kindof a game.PRESIDENT:Yes, he's waiting for them to come to him,you see.EHRLICHMAN:Yep, yep, sure. PRESIDENT:Oh, I might as well tell you, since youhaven't talked to Bob yet, that Dean isinvolved in another one. He probably is gonna be called in the Vesco case. Apparently, it-Is alleged that Dean made acall to, on the Vesco case, to attempt toquash an indictment and they're gonna call him on that damn thing.EHRLICHMAN:Holy smoke.PRESIDENT:So he'll be up there before that grand jurytoo.EHRLICHMAN:What in the world did he do that for?APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:25 TO 7:39 P.M.3PRESIDENT:Probably because Mitchell asked him, I don'tknow. But, uh, so there's that. Uh, but,uh, the uh, I uh,, just for your owncomputation and so forth, I&#8482;m doing a lot, of, lot of thinking about this and I wantyou to do a lot too, but I, I told Petersenlook, I said, I, uh, -he&#8482;s getting his, I told you he&#8482;s getting his paper to me Friday. I told him about the desire to haveyou people, you and Bob, your preliminary,you know, informal discussion at the earliest poss--(unintelligible) and appearbefore the Grand Jury. He said well wemight have to have them again. I said all right have 'em again, but...EHRLICHMAN:Fine.PRESIDENT:...we're on the offensive here.EHRLICHMAN:Good. PRESIDENT:I want to be on the offensive on this thing.You see that's a positive action, too, John.EHRLICHMAN:Sure, sure.PRESIDENT:And I said the other, the, uh, the--Dash,Dash has called--oh, that's the other thingI didn't tell Bob. Dash had called him andsaid that, uh, Dash had called, uh, is trying to get Dean before their committee, see, talked to Dean's counsel and, uh, so,uh, Henry, uh, Petersen is going to try tosee Ervin (unintelligible) out of the country on Monday, to try to get thatknocked off. But, uh, so, Dean may want togo up there and spill his guts.EHRLICHMAN:I see. PRESIDENT:I'm inclined to think with Dean, got to playthe string out a little bit. I mean just abit in terms of seeing just how far he wants to go.EHRLICHMAN:Well, just keep closing doors on him. Yeah.APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:25 TO 7:39 P.M.4PRESIDENT:And, uh, incidentally, uh, uh, he said theprosecution, which originally was thinking in terms of, you know, uh, possibleimmunity, has now reached the conclusionthat&#352;it&#8482;s turned around and just, and I mean&#352;I said, "Not because of what I said nowHenry," I said, "I want to make it clear, Isaid any major person is your decision."EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:He said it is their decision and ours...EHRLICHMAN:Good.PRESIDENT:...that they can't do it because of what isinvolved. I spoke to Kleindienst a bitabout the (unintelligible) and he said hellno, he said one thing about (unintelligible) he said the President can't be blackmailed...EHRLICHMAN:Good.PRESIDENT:...uh, and he says and Kleindienst can't beblackmailed, he mentioned himself, and he said Petersen can't be blackmailed1cause hesaid Dean can shoot all of them you know.And I think John that's what it gets down to.EHRLICHMAN:He's been a bit too cute.PRESIDENT:We're in a fight here where, uh, he tried toblackmail everybody. And uh, and uh...EHRLICHMAN:I think you did the right thing.PRESIDENT:Well, the main thing we have done is not tomake a precipitate decision about anything.EHRLICHMAN:Yep, yep.PRESIDENT:And we're gonna do it in an orderly, rightway.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Now the other thing too, I wanted to tellyou that on the--I want you to think aboutthis business of the, you know, what we talked about...EHRLICHMAN:Right.APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:25 TO 7:39 P.M.5PRESIDENT:...leave of absence and so forth.EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:I&#8482;m not too convinced of that one on Bob,it, it may be, I mean what is there--have you got a minute now?EHRLICHMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:Uh, does the leave of absence thing buy usanything really?EHRLICHMAN:Well...PRESIDENT:Maybe.EHRLICHMAN:...uh, it depends on who you're talking to.Now, uh, I think, I think Connally's aboutright on it that, uh, that it's not good butit's also not as bad as a resignation and, uh, and, uh...PRESIDENT:Right. At least shows you're trying to dosomething.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Basically but, but not for you. EHRLICHMAN:Well, in time. I think we have tocontemplate in due course it'll come but itcan't...PRESIDENT:In due course.EHRLICHMAN:It's premature right now.PRESIDENT:No, we can't do it on the basis of whatwe've got.EHRLICHMAN:That's it.PRESIDENT:But if something blew on the, uh, this thingof the, uh...EHRLICHMAN:Sure. Or if the, the...PRESIDENT:...in the Ellsberg...APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:25 TO 7:39 P.M.6EHRLICHMAN:... if the interview with the U.S. Attorneyor something of that kind went bad why,uh...PRESIDENT:That's right. That's right. But, uh,that's all right too. But, uh, the point isthe leave of absence doesn't convictanybody.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:And also it provides the, uh(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I tell you, I made a mistake, uh, in joiningwith Bob in retaining counsel.PRESIDENT:I think you're right. Yeah, because yourcase is so different from his.EHRLICHMAN:And, uh... PRESIDENT:You better change pretty fast.EHRLICHMAN:If I could, if I can figure out some way ofgetting a little separation I think it's wise to do.PRESIDENT:Couldn't agree more. You've gotta do it.You've gotta do it. Because Bob--John, uh,as you know I love you both but boy, uh, staying together you're in a hell of a lotmore trouble than if you go separately.EHRLICHMAN:That's true, that's true. PRESIDENT:And, uh, and I know your situation and whatit is and, and of course Bob's is moredifficult.EHRLICHMAN:It is different. PRESIDENT:Bob's is a hell of a lot more difficult ontwo scores, let's fact it. One, the wholebusiness of whether he had information before. That I don&#8482;t think they can make stick because of...EHRLICHMAN:I agree.PRESIDENT:...Strachan. I think (unintelligible). Butsecond, uh, the money.APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:25 TO 7:39 P.M.7EHRLICHMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:The money, uh, specifically is gonna be oneson-of-a-bitch.EHRLICHMAN:Yep, it is. PRESIDENT:We've gotta face it.EHRLICHMAN:It is.PRESIDENT:That there is no way. You're, you'regetting-launching Kalmbach and all that sort of thing, uh, so it's dependent to a certainextent on LaRue, too, you know. LaRue,they're now trying to get to plead, and he may, he may plead.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:You know. I mean, look at the poorson-of-a-bitch. I mean he's...EHRLICHMAN:Well...PRESIDENT:B-, b-, but, you, you ought to go separatelyand I would do it soon.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) I am pretty wise to thatwhole operation. LaRue-I don't...PRESIDENT:Well, the only thing that you, you knowthat, that they claim--not the LaRue thing, but is to call the Kalmbach, which you'vejust...EHRLICHMAN:Oh yeah. Well, that, that my fellows saythey can handle.PRESIDENT:John, I think you can too. Good God, I meanthat was purely, was simply humanitarian,basically.EHRLICHMAN:And, and very perfunctory in the whole chainof circumstances.PRESIDENT:That's right, that's right. EHRLICHMAN:Not a proximate cause. PRESIDENT:See, Dean's (unintelligible) at youbasically, lees face it, is with regard tothis whole National Security area, isn't it?APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:25 TO 7:39 P.M.8EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'm glad you did what you did.PRESIDENT:Don't you agree though...EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:...that it's National Security area. But,but you mean like on, uh, letting, uh,having Kleindienst do this. Well, I,didn'thave any choice, he came in and says, "I've got to do this, Mr. President...EHRLICHMAN:I understand.PRESIDENT:...I'm sitting on this thing and it's, it's,it's volcanic."EHRLICHMAN:I understand.PRESIDENT:I could have said, "Dick, that's NationalSecurity, don't pass it on," but if I do it there Dean's got another hammer at our head.EHRLICHMAN:No. You're quite right.PRESIDENT:I do, I hope you don't disagree with me.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, I don't, not at all. PRESIDENT:I, uh, I had to think--I, my own view is, asI said, I have told Dick to call out there,as I just repeated it to you earlier. Uh, Idon't know whether it'll do any good.EHRLICHMAN:Um hmm.PRESIDENT:But at least the U.S. Attorney will know...EHRLICHMAN:OK. PRESIDENT:...that, my God, this is a National Securityinvestigation--was--but it didn't produceanything.EHRLICHMAN:Right. All right sir. See you tomorrow. PRESIDENT:Let us suppose this.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:25 TO 7:39 P.M.9PRESIDENT:Just looking at it, with all of our(unintelligible). You call Dean and thenhe'll go out there and he'll testify tothis. He'll probably say that while he was doing it, as, as he was working inEhrlichman, under Ehrlichmah's.direction,etc. Right? Is that what he'll say?EHRLICHMAN:Uh... PRESIDENT:On the Ellsberg, uh...EHRLICHMAN:I don't think Dean can say that. Uh, theywould have to get some other witness, they would have to get Liddy-or Hunt or somebody.PRESIDENT:To say that they, uh...EHRLICHMAN:Dean was, Dean was not directly involved. PRESIDENT:He wasn't? EHRLICHMAN:No.PRESIDENT:Then how the hell does he know about this?This is hearsay.EHRLICHMAN:Snooping over the fence. PRESIDENT:Oh, I see. Oh, I see. He wasn't an actorin this.EHRLICHMAN:No, sir. PRESIDENT:Uh huh. Well, then there it is, he'll justgo out and he'll do it in hearsay so uh-ifhe did, though, would that connect John-- you?EHRLICHMAN:That's just something we'll have to livewith.PRESIDENT:And we're not gonna die over it. EHRLICHMAN:No, that's right.PRESIDENT:If they did what would you say? Wouldn't uh,wouldn't you just, uh...EHRLICHMAN:Well, I, I'd say what is, what is the fact,that, uh, my connection with it was that Iauthorized their travel and I authorizedthemAPRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:25 TO 7:39 P.M.10(EHRLICHMAN:)to go out and investigate Ellsberg and amongthe things that were to be investigated outthere was a, uh, an examination of hismedical records if that were possible.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:Now they chose a method that I...PRESIDENT:You did not approve. EHRLICHMAN:I did not approve. PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:When I heard about it afterwards Idisapproved of it.PRESIDENT:Did you? Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, in my, my shortcoming, my failing,was in not bringing them to account on it and not just having them arrested on you know, on...PRESIDENT:Yeah, Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...on, uh, on discovery. Since it was a,since it was an...PRESIDENT:Highly sensitive thing...EHRLICHMAN:...military area, why, uh...PRESIDENT:...and you could also find out the, uh,Federal Bureau of Investigation at thattime--how we can ever get that across--wouldnot or could not, how do we say that? We all know why Hoover didn't do it but, uh...EHRLICHMAN:Well, uh, that, that, yeah that&#8482;d be a partof that, I suppose, but I, here again, Ithink I'll talk to Wilson about this in the morning so that he's forewarned.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And he can do some briefing on it.APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:25 TO 7:39 P.M.11PRESIDENT:Well, wait a minute. I don't think there'sany, I can see any legal thing here.do you?I mean illegality...EHRLICHMAN:Well I, as I say, I don't either but I don'tknow, you know.PRESIDENT:No, well for Christ sakes, I mean, uh, youdidn't authorize any damn break-in or anything of that sort.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. That's correct.PRESIDENT:You had nothing to do with that. I don'tmean that, I'm referring now to the public thing, John, rather than the...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah.PRESIDENT:No, no you didn't break the damn law, Idon't mean that. I meant, uh, I mean, uh, these clowns did a lot of things that youknow. You were conducting an investigationinto this matter, and you authorized them to go to check with regard to this and that if--you know and the, so forth, but you didnot know, did not know, and, in fact,discovered it later.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, I was told about it afterward.PRESIDENT:That's right. Were you told?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, afterward. PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah. And was he retained after that?I guess he was.EHRLICHMAN:Not very long.PRESIDENT:Yeah. All right, that's good, that's good.But, let me say, there&#8482;s nothing legal aboveit and so forth. But, uh, let's uh, uh,you're, you're uh-but, but, but the other option for us, for me to try to stomp on Kleindienst and, uh, this fellow again, youknow, and say, look, this is NationalSecurity. You know, I did that tough from Camp David and I think that's about as faras I can go on that.APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:25 TO 7:39 P.M.12EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Well.PRESIDENT:Or do you agree?EHRLICHMAN:I think so. I think you've, you've donewhat you can and should there.PRESIDENT:If I&#8482;d, if I'd told them today look, uh, youcannot use this information, then I thinkDean then had another, another club to hit us with.EHRLICHMAN:Um hum. Right.PRESIDENT:Or do you agree?EHRLICHMAN:Yep. Absolutely. Absolutely, I think thisopens it up and it, uh...PRESIDENT:Right now, right now we gotta...EHRLICHMAN:Let&#8482;s the fresh air out. PRESIDENT:Well, not only fresh air, but--you know aninteresting thing is that, uh, Petersen'sreasction to this, he says, he says the--andI'm so surprised--he says, you know--he didn&#8482;t know about my, he didn't know at the time, I told him I'd talked to Kleindienst,but what the talk was about--and he says,you know, he says, "I think Dean's attorneys made a terrible mistake in, uh, putting thisout to us," and "Why do you think it was amistake?" He said, "Because they were trying to test us, they were trying to see if we got this information, they, theydidn't think we'd use it."EHRLICHMAN:Hmm. PRESIDENT:And they, uh, they didn't and they thoughtthey would hold that over our heads.EHRLICHMAN:Um hmm. PRESIDENT:we had this information with regard to thisillegal break-in and did not use it in theEllsberg case. I think he has a good pointthere.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:25 TO 7:39 P.M.15PRESIDENT:Or do you agree?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah I do.PRESIDENT:And he said...EHRLICHMAN:It takes all the poison out of it, by, uh... PRESIDENT:Yeah, takes the poison out and also putsDean in a position where he doesn't havethat, uh, where he can't say that well, uh, we, uh, stopped the Na--stopped the investigation which was illegal.EHRLICHMAN:Um hmm. Um hmm. Yep.PRESIDENT:But anyway, okay. EHRLICHMAN:All right, sir.PRESIDENT:And stand firm.EHRLICHMAN:Right. See you tomorrow. PRESIDENT:Keep cool. EHRLICHMAN:Fine.
