COLSON:Well I had ah, I had ah, it, it is and I hada press conference last night before thisdinner and I, I talked about all the greataccomplishments of this administration. Now when you were up here five years ago at this dinner you, the country was in flames andcivil war. The spirit of the country was(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Was I there five years ago?COLSON:Yes sir, five years ago you did the, ah--PRESIDENT:Ah, where was it, where'd they hold it? COLSON:At the Statler, and ah you... PRESIDENT:Oh, yes, yes, yes.COLSON:...filled the place and that's when you saidI'd rather be stoned at the Middlesex Club than stoned in Caracas.PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.APRIL 12, 1973, FROM 7:31 TO 7:48 P.M.3COLSON:Great speech (unintelligible).PRESIDENT: Huh?COLSON:I was with you and ah Charlie Morgan my lawpartner and I was ah--PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:(unintelligible) the bastards.PRESIDENT:So you told 'em that? What happened? COLSON:Well I, I went through all this last night,and, and all the things that have happenedin this country, the depression in thenational spirit, the way you've lifted that; the ending of the war; the ending of thear--, I mean the slowing of the arms race;the recognition of China, a different world we live in today, and--PRESIDENT:That's right, that's the thing, that's theway to talk.COLSON:I went through all of this in the pressconference, I did it in the speech but I didn&#8482;t want ah, I did it in the pressconference and, and then I answered somequestions on Watergate and of course what's on television last night, Watergate right.(laughs) That's what makes you so mad, you'dlike to be able to get out and...PRESIDENT:I know. COLSON:...hammer away at ah, at what ah--PRESIDENT:I wonder if you would sit down, I told ahBob Haldeman, Ehrlichman this today, that i thought could be good for everybody to doit. Just sort of write your precis as towhat the hell, how you see this thing unfolding and how we should handle it, you know, it's a, ah, I'm sure you've thoughtabout it because you see with everybodygoing off in his own direction that's, that&#8482;s not good but...APRIL 12, 1973, FROM 7:31 TO 7:48 P.M.4COLSON:No.PRESIDENT:...what you really got to come down to is tosay "Now, what in hell do we do here." Yousee. Because, I ah (coughs) I, I think, I think that the worse thing is for us all toget so obsessed with it that we think it'sthe only story in town. That's what the press wants, that's what the, the Ervin wants, on the part of the Democrats.COLSON:That's right.PRESIDENT:So good God, it's a terrible mistake. Huh? COLSON:It is--PRESIDENT:What do you think at the moment?COLSON:No, that's precisely what I think. My viewis that it's ah, my view is that we should decide on what the plan ought to be.Everybody follow it and whatever it is,whatever the decision is...PRESIDENT:Um Huh. COLSON:...that has to be made. I feel a decisionhas to be made. I think that, that ah,where this, where this Watergate is hurting us, Mr. President, is not with the man inthe street, he just doesn't give a damn. Imean rea1ly, frankly doesn't see much wrong with ah--PRESIDENT:Well, it's the elite.COLSON:It's with the elite but it, but the worseplace it is, is with the party people.PRESIDENT:That's what I mean, by the elite, by, I meanthe finance contributors and all thoseassholes.COLSON: Precisely. PRESIDENT:That's right.COLSON:That&#8482;s right, that&#8482;s right.PRESIDENT:I sometimes think it doesn&#8482;t matter anywaycause they&#8482;re never very strong anyway.APRIL 12, 1973, FROM 7:31 TO 7:48 P.M.5COLSON:Well that's right except that it, except-PRESIDENT:That's why the Armstrongs and, and theGoldwaters pop off.COLSON:Well it's, they're not strong for us, but,but it&#8482;s ah, it's a hell of a depressantwhen they're not with us. I mean it's ah, Iagree with you that they're not worth a hell of a lot.PRESIDENT:I know.COLSON:(unintelligible) perfectly honest.PRESIDENT:Yeah, right. COLSON:But ah--PRESIDENT:I know, I know but you've got to have 'em, Iknow.COLSON:Yeah, they're bad to have against us. PRESIDENT:That's the very thing that destroyed Adams,you know wasn't the...COLSON:That's right. PRESIDENT:...it wasn't the, I mean, poor Adams didn'tdo a damn thing but Bridges, plus the partyelite knocked his ass off.COLSON:Well I go back, I have to go back I'mafraid, ah, Mr. President to the, to thepoint that I've, I've made to you back inJanuary and that is, that if there was someone involved, and I don't, I've never known, ah--PRESIDENT:Uh huh.COLSON:Ah. PRESIDENT:He ought to come forward.COLSON:At this point he needs to, because...APRIL 12, 1973, FROM 7:31 TO 7:48 P.M.6PRESIDENT:That's right.COLSON:...what's gonna happen is that apparentlyhe's gonna be, he's gonna be found out andah--PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s right.COLSON:But in the process it's goin' to, it's goin'to tar things for you and it&#8482;s going to ah. Frankly there&#8482;ll be other things falling out that are perfectly innocent and harmless butah...PRESIDENT:Hum. COLSON:...viewed in the context now my God, they'llput him up before a firing squad.PRESIDENT:That's right. COLSON:The thing you want to do is it seems to me-- PRESIDENT:Yeah. All of the l--, all of the perfectlylegitimate but hard line...COLSON:Right. PRESIDENT:...and campaign activities appear to be ahespionage or sabotage, well God damn it,they're not.COLSON:But you see that'll, that'll be-- PRESIDENT:That's the point.COLSON:Ah, that's--PRESIDENT:But the point is somebody's got to step upbut who the hells gonna do that (laughs).COLSON:Well that was the case, that was the pointthat Dave Shapiro made a couple of monthsago.PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 12, 1973, FROM 7:31 TO 7:48 P.M.7COLSON:Brilliant trial lawyer. He said, "Look,there's a time in every case when you ahsimply have got to cut your losses." Hesaid, "You, otherwise you're gonna get, in the end, the real problem will be the fallout from a lot of other things that you'renot even anticipating right now."PRESIDENT:Yeah. COLSON:And ah--PRESIDENT:True.COLSON:I&#8482;m afraid that's, that&#8482;s where I would haveto come out if--PRESIDENT:But the finger at the present time,unfortunately goes to the campaign committee doesn't it?COLSON:Yes sir, very much so.PRESIDENT:You think that's accurate?COLSON:There's just a hell of a lot ofcircumstantial evidence but it's building awfully fast and ah they're all jumping shipover there, you know. The lower levels areall talking to different reporters and--PRESIDENT:Are they?COLSON:Yes sir, and--PRESIDENT:What are they saying? COLSON:Oh, they're pointing fingers every placeexcept at you know whoever's talking to theparticular reporter isn't pointing athimself. But otherwise, he's pointing at everybody else. Ah, I've developed, since Ileft the White House, some kind of new anduseful intell...PRESIDENT:Contacts, right. COLSON:That I didn't know existed in Washington.That's very interesting. I know everybodywalks in and out of Jack Anderson&#8482;s office right&#352;-APRIL 12, 1973, FROM 7:31 TO 7:48 P.M.8PRESIDENT:Good, that's good.COLSON:This is from co-opting a few people like ahShapiro and ah...PRESIDENT:Uh huh. COLSON:...and one or two of his friends. They'renow on our team and...PRESIDENT:Good. COLSON:...Christ, we, we find out a lot that wedidn't know before. (Laugh)PRESIDENT:Right, well--COLSON:But, ah, my only, my only, I'm qonna, ahJohn called me tonight and told me he wanteda precis and I--PRESIDENT:That's right. COLSON:I've got you three of them, ah that I'mgonna come over and see John with tomorrow,they're...PRESIDENT:Yeah. COLSON:...great. PRESIDENT:If you wanna get Hill's and yours...COLSON:Right.PRESIDENT:...apart from me because I must, I've reallygot to tend to the business of the country,you know...COLSON:Oh no, you-- PRESIDENT:...I just can't get--I'm trying to keeppeople from keeping me out of the God damnedthing, you know, because I know nothingabout it (laugh)COLSON:No, that&#8482;s right.APRIL 12, 1973, FROM 7:31 TO 7:48 P.M.9PRESIDENT:...part of the problem.COLSON:No, that"s exactly right, I, I--PRESIDETN:So they all come trotting in and say, "Look,what'll do we do." And T said, "Well, God damn it, find out.&#64258;COLSON:Um hum. That's right.PRESIDENT:Don't you agree? COLSON:Yes sir. I think you should, you know, I&#8482;m,I&#8482;m the one fellow that can attest to that.I remember talking to you the week after.You were, you were horrified and this, and that&#8482;s one thing that should not bePRESIDENT:Well I...COLSON:...should not concern you anyway. PRESIDENT:But, it isn&#8482;t a question whether I washorrified, I didn&#8482;t know about it but ah-COLSON:No, I mean, but surprised, it&#8482;sPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) it was unbelievable that ahthat such stupidity could have been committed but ah, all of us felt that way.COLSON:It was oh, it was (tape noise) good. I, Ithink you should keep out of this. I ah the biggest negative to the Watergate in mymind. Eventually it's gonna come out ahthere's just too damn many neople involved.PRESIDENT:Oh sure, the whole God damn story&#8482;s gonnacome out.COLSON:The whole story's gonna come out, andtherefore I come to the conclusion that--PRESIDENT:Get it out fast.APRIL 12, 1973, FROM 7:31 TO 7:48 P.M.10COLSON:Get it out and get it over with and cut offthese hearings and stop this, this farcethat's going on. And let&#8482;s start remindingthe American people of the extraordinary accomplishmentsPRESIDENT:That's right.COLSON:...that you performed in this country. Youknow I had so many people come up to me last night after the dinner and say, "Thank God,it's great to put it all back inperspective," because they, and that's all that our--PRESIDENT:They tend to get all tied up with this crap.COLSON:Exactly and I felt it should be out and ourpeople should be out, ah being dammed up, they, I, I think it's--PRESIDENT:Because after all, sure we got someinflation but there&#8482;s, this is, the God damn boom is unbelievable, you know, it's movin', this country's movin' right now.COLSON:Oh, I had a meeting with all the bankers inBoston today, this was one of the reasons I stayed up and I never heard anything likeit. They're, they're, of course they'reconcerned with inflation but ah--PRESIDENT:Well of course, but ah, they... COLSON:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:...they prefer a boom with inflation...COLSON:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:...than inflation and depre--, depression.COLSON:Yeah, they don't see any recession ahead atall, next year or the year after. They just think we're in one of the great uplifting cycles. They think you've increasedproductivity like ah has never happenedbefore, that ah--APRIL 12, 1973, FROM 7:31 TO 7:48 P.M.11PRESIDENT:Um hum.COLSON:Period of sustained expansion ahead, Ithink, the country's in, in great shape andah that's what kills me about sitting around wringing our--PRESIDENT:Grouching, that's right. Everybody is sortof in a bomb shelter at the present time and then--COLSON:That's right.PRESIDENT:You know, sort, Well I don't, I, I, you knowwhat I mean. I kinda say, "Oh Good God, what are we going to do." Well, ah wemusn't do that we just, it's like, it's likeITT, look we took three months worrying about it, didn't mean a God damn thing.COLSON:No.PRESIDENT:Watergate is worse because it involves someof our closest people.COLSO11:That's right. PRESIDENT:But ah what the hell we do about 'em, Idon&#8482;t know.COLSON:Well I, I think-- PRESIDENT:'CourseITT involved Mitchell, Flanigan--COLSON:Yep.PRESIDENT:Who else? COLSON:Oh, it was ah, Mitch... PRESIDENT:Kleindienst?COLSON:Ah, Kleindienst ah--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) COLSON:Ah (unintelligible) Freeze (phonetic), a lotof other people.APRIL 12, 1973, FROM 7:31 TO 7:48 P.M.12PRESIDENT:Who?COLSOIN:But, and they, and that was a hell of asensation front page every day, it, it just,you know, it just doesn't affect the ah, how the average guyPRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:...is living his life. And that's ah,that's what's important, I mean that's what they-PRESIDENT:Yeah. I think there's a tendency foreverybody to get upset with Watergate as being, that this is the thing that's gonnadestroy the Presidency, you know. This issort of ah view of the Ray Price and that kind of group, you know what I mean (unintelligible). They say this is, this isgonna destroy the Presidency so ,what, theymay be right.COLSON:No it isn't going to Mr. President. PRESIDENT:But if, but if they are right, the country'sin a hell of a shape.COLSON:That's right. Yeah but, yeah but they'renot right.PRESIDENT:When you stop to think of the fact that,that, that, that, that the Adams thing which involved personal venality, they didn't, nobody even remembers Adams today.COLSON:No.PRESIDENT:But this, which involves political crappin'around I don't know.COLSON:You know, the damnable part about this isthat it has a catchy name like Teapot Dome and so...PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON...everybody's sayin' it's Watergate andTeapot Dome. Now I, I asked a whole group of peopleAPRIL 12, 1973, FROM 7:31 TO 7:48 P.M.13COLSON(CONTINUED):earlier this week who can tell me the factsof the Teapot Dome case, nobody can. Butthey remember that name.PRESIDENT:That's right.COLSON:They'll remember the God damn Watergatename. Adams ah--PRESIDENT:Yeah. COLSON:You know, he's one fellow so that sort of...PRESIDENT:Right.COLSON:...passed over. But the, I think the, theterribly important point is, Watergate isnot going to destroy the Presidency becauseeventually the facts will come out. They have to. Once they come out, as long as someone takes action, then it's gonna be,then it's gonna be, and you can't keep themtalking about the God damn thing.PRESIDENT:If someone takes action, you mean againstwho?COLSON:Well whoever, whoever-PRESIDENT:Whoever did? COLSON:Yep.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well that's pretty tough.COLSON:(Unintelligible) that's, you know, when thathappens well then, then, that's the end of the, that's the end of the story. Then youhave the complete defense to ah--PRESIDENT:'Course they're not just gonna stop there.They're gonna to go on to Segretti which isjust crap as you know.COLSON:But they can&#8482;tAPRIL 12, 1973, FROM 7:31 TO 7:48 P.M.14PRESIDENT:...but we ought to be defens- we ought tojust take the attack on that and say, "ForChrist sake what about burying down ourheadquarters and all that sort of thing.&#64258;COLSON:Oh, absolutely.PRESIDENT:And, and apparently ah, and I&#8482;ve told alsoyour gettin' them to get ah, in, in touch with you because Buchanan was working on this and he said we don't have anything.COLSON:Oh hell, we had a lot of--PRESIDENT:And I said, well God damn it, Colson'soffice is working on this for months, sothey've got something.COLSON:Well, I've sent them all, I've sent then allback into the files. I, I saw them all Wednesday and then ah--PRESIDENT:Good.COLSON:Yesterday and ah day before yesterday, Isent 'em all in the files.PRESIDENT:You see it's terribly important that at thchighest priority put not only right in thefiles but get it chapter and verse and put out a God damn white paper that&#8482;ll scourthem a little because they did, they did ahell of a lot of bad things that---COLSON:Well and they-- PRESIDENT:--starting with the convention.COLSON:Not only that, Mr. President, but, but ah McGovern today is ah using lists that were prepared, mailing lists that were prepared,with political fund. Ah leasing them out,people can buy them or rent them from him. That's the same thing that Tom Dodd did. It's taking political money and convertingit to your personal profit. I gave that to-APRIL 12, 1973, FROM 7:31 TO 7:48 P.M.15PRESIDENT:Well I, who'd you give that to(unintelligible) just any?COLSON:I gave that to--PRESIDENT:Some stupid ass, or somebody that can dosomethin' about it?COLSON:I gave it to Adams today to research, he's abright young fellow.PRESIDENT:Um hum. COLSON:We&#8482;ll get it out, Ah, it, if we can hang iton him.PRESIDENT:Get it out or put it out. COLSON:That's the kind of stuff, but what the hell,that's, I mean that's personal profit frompolitical...PRESIDENT:That's right. COLSON:...contributions.PRESIDENT:That's right.COLSON:(Unintelligible) they hung that out. PRESIDENT:He's selling his funds. COLSON:That's right.PRESIDENT:And his, his, that's right.COLSON:Yeah, they're not his lists, they belong tothe...PRESIDENT:That's right.COLSON:...(unintelligible) who contributed. PRESIDENT:Well, any event, ah do your study and ahtell the people to get the hell off the ahdefensive. But I personally, you know, I&#8482;mnotAPRIL 12, 1973, FROM 7:31 TO 7:48 P.M.16PRESIDENT(CONTINUED):ah I'm not a bit ah depressed about thething. I think that there's a tendencythough for most of our people to get sort of in their, their, in their bomb shelters andsort of hunker down and say, "Oh Christ,everything's coming town-apart." Well, we've got a few things that we should be proud of, you know.COLSON:Oh. Mr. President, you know I was thinkingof that last night, it, Cambodia, I remember after Cambodia we were all cowering when weshould have been out proud as hell.PRESIDENT:That's right. COLSON:The, it's this thing, the most importantthing is, if I had any advice at all foryou, the most important thing is not to letthe damn thing divert you from, from the...PRESIDENT:Doing other things, right. COLSON:...the magnificant things that are, I meanthe difference in this country today andwhen you became President is, is everyone of us who has had any part of this have so muchto be proud of and talk about it.PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s the point. COLSON:Just not, God damn it. PRESIDENT:Yeah and the whole damned White House staffand everybody else has gotta be proud ratherthan ah whining around and bitching about this thing.COLSON:Well, that's right and, and this, this thingis going to, one way or another this thing--PRESIDENT:It'll pass. COLSON:It has to wring out and pass. And then, soit's-PRESIDENT:Right.APRIL 12, 1973, FROM 7:31 TO 7:48 P.M.17COLSON:So it's ah--PRESIDENT:Would you believe that the (unintelligible)is how do you, how do you got ah brought toa conclusion.COLSON:Well--PRESIDENT:Nobody knows.COLSON:I'll give you some ideas on that. PRESIDENT:All right. COLSON:Because I know how that can be done.PRESIDENT:All right. And bring, and give me a paperon that will you?COLSON:I'll have one for you, yeah.PRESIDENT:Okay.COLSON:Thank you, Mr. President. PRESIDENT:All right. COLSON:It's good to talk to you sir.
