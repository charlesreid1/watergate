PRESIDENT:Is there any, uh, way that, uh, evensurreptitiously or discreetly or otherwise Imean, that, ah, way you could determinewhether uh, this matter of whether Dean might have walked in there with a recorderon him? I don't know.HALDEMAN:No, I don't think there is any way. I thinkya gotta, so remote as to be almost beyond possibility. And uh, and if he did(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well we've gotta I mean, its, it(unintelligible), but the point is that that's ah, that's a real bomb isn't it?HALDEMAN:Ah, ya.PRESIDENT:Sure is. That, that's what may be his bomb.In other words he (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:NoPRESIDENT:Put that on the desk with Henry Petersen andsays, "I gotta recording of the President of the United States and here's what he said."HALDEMAN:Well, that would be very hard.PRESIDENT:If he did it, then we'd say, "yes HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) virtually impossible.APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.2PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Not virtually impossible.If he did it we'd say, "Yes, sir, that was a recording and I was investigatingHALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:On the other hand (laughs) it'd be god damnhard on, I mean, he'd run that in the pressthat'd be (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Yeah PRESIDENT:Well, no way to, no way to find out isthere?HALDEMAN:No, there isn't any, there isn't any(unintelligible) no way anybody would knowPRESIDENT:We have noHALDEMAN:Except him.PRESIDENT:record of uh, we don't have any(unintelligible) as to whether he has doneHALDEMAN:NonePRESIDENT:that before, have we?HALDEMAN:None. We have no evidence at any time underany circumstances, and I've, you know, been involved in enough, you know, what is goingon that I, I just find it impossible tothink that, that there would (unintelligible) you know, it could possiblybe the case.PRESIDENT:Ummh. One thing about those things, youthink that you know when a fellow walks into me, and I didn't look at him that closely,but you were there, god damn I mean, I, I'dthink that it's a little, it's, it's, even the smallest ones are bulky enough that youmean, with a fellow like Dean you'd sort ofsee that wouldn't ya, where do you carry them, in your hip pocket or your breast pocket?APRIL 25, 1974 FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.3HALDEMAN:Oh, under your arm, you know, where theycarry a pistol holster or something.PRESIDENT:Um hmm, ya. WellHALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) I really don't thinkit's--it's so remote as to be almost beyondthePRESIDENT:Ya, ya HALDEMAN:...realm of possibility PRESIDENT:In this matter nothing is beyond the realmof possibility. (laughter)HALDEMAN:No, that's true but ah PRESIDENT:YaHALDEMAN:And, andPRESIDENT:But of course we draw the sword on that ifah, if ahHALDEMAN:(clears throat) I think if, if that's thesubject he has in mind, that he, he's justgoing to do it on the basis of his own, you know, his own record afterwards, there's no check.PRESIDENT:Oh well, on that we'll destroy him.HALDEMAN:And ah PRESIDENT:Its his word againstHALDEMAN:You know from the big (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:His word against HALDEMAN:Something like that PRESIDENT:His word--what? His word against thePresident's the ah, the ah, (unintelligible)you were there but particularly the President's on that (unintelligible). Theonly other thing is of course hisconversation with regard to the, I mean, the little slip in your office about the...APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.4HALDEMAN:But that.PRESIDENT:That was so casual. HALDEMAN:I don&#8482;t think you&#8482;re going to have, theproblem with that. I mean, other than,other than perhaps an effort to, to base it on his conversation and you know, hismemorandum afterwards of had he donesomething like that, but he didn&#8482;t usually do that.PRESIDENT:Didn&#8482;t he?HALDEMAN:Ummh ummhPRESIDENT:He didn't write conversations memorandum? HALDEMAN:Not usually.PRESIDENT:Hm. He probably did on this one. But uh,(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:As I said it sounds as if he had notes whichyou, you said he thought he did(unintelligible) you know he might have usedthat ahPRESIDENT:Ya that, but I mean, but he didn't make anynotes in any conversation I ever had withhim, he always sat there and then-probablyas a (unintelligible) with a good memory, you can go back and write everything downyou can remember.HALDEMAN:Ya, ya. PRESIDENT:But ah, he's always had or made a memorandumof the conversation afterwards and I saidthis and that, on the other hand, Zieglerhad a good point about Dean which he made a few days ago, he said John Dean'scredibility is nil becauseAPRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.5HALDEMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:The Dean report has proved to be false andeverything else andHALDEMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:And you have something to say and that' whatwe gotta have in mind here now without youand John to get too god damned discouragedabout this because basically John Dean, ah, his report, uh, that he now claims that he didn't make, his subornation of perjury, hiseverything elseHALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:He's ah, who the hell is to believe whathe's going to say now, and he's saying itnow for what purpose? He's going to be, of course, saying, "Well I, they're making me the scape goat and all the rest, andtherefore I'm going to tell all," and he'sgoing, and as he says, "I'll try this," his attorney says, "This administration right up to the President," he didn't say thePresident, but you know that's what theysaid.HALDEMAN:Yeah, but that's (unintelligible) thepurpose--when you get down to trying to doit, they got a very tough time.PRESIDENT:Purpose of course was to get everybody--which now the Prosecutor Chuck, Bob, is notabout to give 'em.HALDEMAN:Really? PRESIDENT:No, sir, they're not. Oh, Petersen saysthat I said, "Now alright, you make yourjudgment on your own," I said, "not on my behalf. He said "No," he says, "he's just--much involved as a principal. We justcan't do it." And frankly I think it's justas well. I think ifAPRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.6HALDEMAN:He's right.PRESIDENT:I think if you--I think if you're in aposition now, that if you gave him immunity,he would sit there the rest of our lives.HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Hanging it over ya, and the point is thatah, now if he's going to have this pissingcontest (unintelligible) all right, bring it out and fight it out and it'll be a bloody god damn thing, you know in a strange kindof way that's life, isn't it(unintelligible) probably be understood and be rough as a cob, an we'll survive and somepeople you'll even find (unintelligible) inMississippi you'll find a half a dozen people that will be for the President.HALDEMAN:(Laughs) Be a lot more than that.PRESIDENT:(unintelligible) No. We do still have somesupport in the country, I hope. But, uhHALDEMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:But we shall see, do you agree?HALDEMAN:Absolutely.PRESIDENT:(Laughs) HALDEMAN:No question.PRESIDENT:Ya, ya, that's right despite all the pollsand all the rest, I think there's still a hell of a lot of people out there, and from what I've seen, they're--you know, they,they want to believe, that's the point,isn't it?APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.7HALDEMAN:Why sure. Want to, and do.PRESIDENT:All right. By the way, I thought there wasjust a th--thought that maybe you couldcheck th--that thingHALDEMAN:No PRESIDENT:But there no way you can check it.HALDEMAN:There isn't anything to check.PRESIDENT:You've never heard that, uh, that he's everdone that before.HALDEMAN:Never, never.PRESIDENT:Um hmm. Although as I say, if worse comesto worse, an he has one, well, we've got one. (Laughs).HALDEMAN:YupPRESIDENT:No. But what I mean is&#352;you&#8482;ve gotta livewith it, that&#8482;s it...HALDEMAN:Well know it&#8482;s there at least, an uh--PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s right, that&#8482;s right, that's right.Tommorrow th-, th-, the-, there&#8482;s a little left on what the one you had this day, right?HALDEMAN:YepPRESIDENT:Um hmm. But-but you were there during thatdiscussion.HALDEMAN:yepPRESIDENT:And I suppose that we problably discussedhow the hell we get the 120, right? I don&#8482;t remember it.APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.8HALDEMAN:No, no. I don&#8482;t think so, I think it was,you know, just sort of a rehash of the other thing...PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s right.HALDEMAN:And basically going into the impossibilityof doing it.PRESIDENT:And the next day you, I suppose the questionis, well, did you get the 120, I may have asked him that, I don&#8482;t know. I don&#8482;t think I did but I... (laughs)HALDEMAN:I&#8482;m not even sure there was second.PRESIDENT:Yep.
