I tell ya what I really want, I want him to sign.EHRLICHMAN:Did you get those?PRESIDENT:Yes, I did. PRESIDENT:I'm going to have him sign. I'm going toask him which one he wants to sign and sayabout that news clip that, uh, it seems tome that I should not, uh, I mean I, I, don't want to press anything and uh, I'm not, or,or, should I just have him sign it, whetherit's effective today or uh, not announce it. What&#8482;s your advice on that? We've got plenty of time. Don't worry about that.EHRLICHMAN:Well, my -as I made them out it occurred tome that uh he ought to sign both of them.Then, you could use whichever one you wantedor not depending on how circumstances unfold.PRESIDENT:OK, that's right, that's right. GoodEHRLICHMAN:And if he won't. You know, you know what todo at that point.HALDEMAN:And if he--you go, you go to Petersenand-ask you not to...SEVERAL VOICES: (Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:I still have, that&#8482;s right, I still have myoption to do that. The second point, John,that I want to nail down, uh, what Dean saidabout other bugs from the White House and so forth and so on. Aren't, isn't -I assumethat's the Plumbing operation.EHRLICHMAN:No, no, no. What he's referring to there... PRESIDENT:about the FBI-- EHRLICHMAN:is, is the FBI bugs on the journalists inthe first year.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 9:50 TO 9:59 A.M.2PRESIDENT:This was not from you, He thought these wereprivate bugs.EHRLICHMAN:Oh no. No, no. These, thesePRESIDENT:No, he said they were EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, well, IPRESIDENT:...private bugs.EHRLICHMAN:These were PRESIDENT:That he knew about. EHRLICHMAN:These were almost all FBI bugs, but notentirely though.PRESIDENT:What, what is he, what is he referring to ifit what I'm just sayingEHRLICHMAN:They're all national security.PRESIDENT:Well, that's what I mean. EHRLICHMAN:But, I... PRESIDENT:I was wondering if -what's your advice, if Ishould not tell him today that anything inthat area is national security and privileged.EHRLICHMAN:I think you should, and I think it shouldcover not only that, but the P1unbingoperation, and uh, anything e1se of which he has knowledge.PRESIDENT: Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Say I am impressing that with ExecutivePrivilege right now.PRESIDENT:Executive privi1ege.EHRLICHMAN:And I don't want to ever hear...PRESIDENT: Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...that you have discussed those matters...APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 9:50 TO 9:59 A.M.3PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...with any third person.PRESIDENT:I don&#8482;t know whether he did. He might have.EHRLICHMAN:Well, you might ask him if he has...PRESIDENT: Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:afterwards, uh, or before. But... PRESIDENT:But I -see, that didn't occur to me last nightit occurred to me (unintelligible) in whichcase I'm going to get him in.EHRLICHMAN:Now, if you remember that whole operation wasbecause you were afraid there were leaks outof the NSC.PRESIDENT:That's right, that's right. EHRLICHMAN:And you were trying to find them.PRESIDENT:I thought we were --, I thought they werethrough the FBI.EHRLICHMAN:Well, almost all of themPRESIDENT:We were going to do some of them.EHRLICHMAN:A1most all of them were but there was one inGeorgetown at somebody's house that actuallynever was-put on. It wasn't feasible, but itwas explored and, and how Dean knows about that, I don't know. The FBI files...PRESIDENT:Query, Does Liddy know?EHRLICHMAN:I can't, I can't say. I doubt it. I thinkthat was before his time.PRESIDENT:The reason that I made the call while inDean's presence last night was that he saidthat Liddy's--Liddy would say how he knows this, that Liddy had told the Bureau orsomething like that. I said,"Sean, .whatshould I do?" "Well," he said, "you ought toget a hold of his attorney.&#64258; I said "Yeah,(unintelligible) his attorney"(unintelligible)and he said, he said, "Liddy says he will nottalk because of -_ higher authority."Isaid, "Now look here, higher authorities, it'snot the President, it's Mitchell.&#64258; And I said, "Well"--APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 9:50 TO 9:59 A.M.4PRESIDENT:so I called Petersen, I said, "You are to(continued)tell Liddy's attorney that -or Liddy, that there's,the President's not asking" -Don't you think that's the correct thing to do?HALDEMAN:That's -- EHRLICHMAN:It can't hurt anything at this point and itcertainly is consistent with the things you had me do with Mitchell and Magruder.PRESIDENT:Such as like what? The--EHRLICHMAN:Remove any impediment against their testifying byreason of any misplaced loyalty to you.PRESIDENT:One thing I was, uh, Bob will run over with you(unintelligible), the uh, uh, subject is very important to just tick it off briefly, before one, that if you and he can sit down today and put both your cases down at their worst as how you think it's going to come out, you know, so that I canlook at them and as I say, I'm not gonna, I'm notgonna make any God damn hasty decisions until I see what the hell, how this bounces around, because -Petersen is obviously reacting to the Magruder thing.BULL:[At door]John Dean is here, Mr. President. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) about five or ten minutes.(Unintelligible) building construction(unintelligible) Christ! Uh, it's obviouslydisturbed so that -and they're out to demonstrate over there doing this job. The second point is that uh, I would like also a scenario evolved with regard to, uh, the President's role, in other words, when the President began to find out about this, what he did, I think it&#8482;s a pretty good role John, I'm, I'm not sure of it. It's as good as I can guess because remember I got Dean in, first Isaid I wanted him to report, sent him to CampDavid. He came back and said he couldn't and I want to ask him about that today, and then you, and I'd like you to give Steve your report and everything you did -see what I mean. Also, then, third, there is the PR thing, as to, when we, when we disclosed that and haw.EHRLICHMAN:Ziegler has just left my office. He feels we haveno more than twelve hours.PRESIDENT:Right.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 9:50 TO 9:59 A.M.5EHRLICHMAN:Uh, he, he's got some, uh, input from thePost and uh, it's his estimate that unlesswe take the initiative by nine o'clocktonight,PRESIDENT:Uh hum.EHRLICHMAN:uh, it wil1 be too late. Now, for thatreason, I would suggest that Ziegler sit in a meeting with Petersen and that you and Ziegler persuade Petersen that theannouncement has to come from the WhiteHouse.PRESIDENT:I'll tell him.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, otherwise the Justice Department will,of course, try andPRESIDENT:Uh, huh. EHRLICHMAN:pre-empt this whole thing.PRESIDENT: Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:But I think it would be a good idea for youto spend, uh,...PRESIDENT:I don't -I think, I think I've got to getPetersen in alone first.EHRLICHMAN:Sure, sure, I understand. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) then I'll pull Ziegler in.HALDEMAN: Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Uh... PRESIDENT:That's a very good point.EHRLICHMAN:Now, you may want to listen to Ron for sometime ahead of time. He's got this well thought through and, and well laid out, andI think he's quite dispassionate about it,quite, quite, uh...HALDEMAN:Well, we'll go over that with him. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, we'll do that now while you're gone.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 9:50 TO 9:59 A.M.6HALDEMAN:There's one point in -before you talk toDean that, that I, occurred to me last nightthat doesn't fit together. Maybe it doesn'tmatter, and that is you said, last night, as I understood it, that Petersen had told youthat Liddy has not talked.PRESIDENT: Yeah. HALDEMAN:And that they can't get Liddy to talk. PRESIDENT: Yeah.HALDEMAN:Dean told us that Liddy had told themeverything.EHRLICHMAN:Told the U.S. Attorney everything.HALDEMAN:There&#8482;s something screwy...EHRLICHMAN:Informa1ly. HALDEMAN:There&#8482;s something screwy... PRESIDENT:I know that, I know that, but I...HALDEMAN:Petersen's either lying to you or Dean&#8482;slying to us.PRESIDENT:I may be, maybe a 1ittle bold but, what Ithink is probably c1oser to the truth isthat Dean started this business a few weeksago with his attorneys.HALDEMAN:Uh um.EHRLICHMAN:Uh um.PRESIDENT:...and decided to save his ass and hisattorney's, went in and probably the U.S. Attorney gave him a snow job and said thatyou're -that Liddy has talked.EHRLICHMAN:Either that or Dean used that story as acover-up...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:...in case anything started to seep out. PRESIDENT:Did a cover-up. HALDEMAN:Yeah. Then it would of come from Liddyrather than...APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 9:50 TO 9:59 A.M.7EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah.HALDEMAN:...from him. PRESIDENT:How's Ron think it ought to be done? I shou1d doit.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, Ron thinks that it ought to be done fromhere, uh, that uh... well, he hasn't saidwhether you should do it. Uh, I mentioned it tohim the other day that you thought you should do it here in the Press room, if you did it at all.PRESIDENT:I could do it right here in the Oval Office. EHRLICHMAN:Yes, uh, but he, he wants to get out the factthat uh, Dean disserved you, that the Deanreport was inadequate, it didn't go far enough,that, uh, several weeks ago, uh, you reinstituted uh, uh, an examination of the...PRESIDENT:I began my personal investigation of the case. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, and that this culminated in a whole seriesof actionsPRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:over the weekend.PRESIDENT:Personal investigation of the case in that Ispent the weekend working on it. I think that's what we&#8482;ve got to say. The Dean rep, report, did not, did not, uh...HALDEMAN:That this is the week of Mitchell being hereSaturday is very important to the circumstances.PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s right. But uh, the President askedEhrlichman to conduct his own investigation.EHRLICHMAN:Well, now, if I'm going to be, if I'm going tobe splashed on this thing, you're better off not having another discredited Dean.PRESIDENT:Yeah, well, somebody's got to do it.EHRLICHMAN:Well, you can downplay who did it. HALDEMAN:You can say you did it yourself by talking toall the people...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...concerned.PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 9:50 TO 9:59 A.M.8HALDEMAN:You talked to me and Ehr1ichman and everybodye1se...SEVERAL VOICES: (Unintelligib1e)PRESIDENT:I, I made my own investigation of the matter.EHRLICHMAN:I think that's that's the way.PRESIDENT:My own investigation of the matter. But Ididn't ta1k to Mitchell, see.EHRLICHMAN:Well, they say who did and you delegated me todo that. I mean that's, that's -but, uh,...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)Ehrlichman(unintelligible) look you're splash though isonly on this one God damn thing.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think there's a, there's a judgmentcall here,PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:as to whether you want the quote Ehrlichmanreport unquote...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...out in the, in the media.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:(unintelligible) because they'll make a bigthing about the Dean report...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:found out that Dean was guilty and theEhrlichman report found out that Ehrlichman...PRESIDENT:Right. No, no. Now query, uh, would you mindtelling Moore to see Gray or is that out ofthe question. I mean he, you can talk to himcan't you. The only point is time is of the essence right now. I, you know, I, I, I, I'vegot odds and ends here today that I have to...EHRLICHMAN:I, I understandPRESIDENT:No, I'll do it.EHRLICHMAN:No, no, I'll take care of it.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 9:50 TO 9:59 A.M.9PRESIDENT:Alright, what you can say is -give him the twoby four, say now, look here, here's thesituation. Have you talked to Fielding yet tofind out what the situation is?EHRLICHMAN:No. No. No, as a matter of fact, I I&#8482;ve gota problem here. I'm going to have Moore talk to Fielding also,...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:and find out what was in there, because Idon't want to know.PRESIDENT:Right, that's right (unintelligible) that'sgreat.EHRLICHMAN:And then Moore can advise you. PRESIDENT:OK, and, uh, -then, I don't know whatstatement I'd like to have Ron, maybe betweennow and the time --I, I, I, I, I've put offmy, the meeting with the guy at 1:30, John.EHRLICHMAN:Um.PRESIDENT:Uh, Petersen, I mean, I had to because Icouldn't get time to go through...EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:...what he wants. (unintelligible) but that'sjust well enough because it gives me a chancewhen I get back to take my breath and take alook at that.EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:And be ready for it. But uh, but I'm, uh, I'mnot going to let him, uh, him put this outthat the Justice Department dragged this out of the White House. You God damned rights.In fact I'll, uh, -now I can have him do it.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'll tell you what you might do is havehim standing by you...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...just standing there, you do it, and thenyou say Petersen here is...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...working with me on this.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 9:50 TO 9:59 A.M.10PRESIDENT:Yeah.

I want Petersen to be ableto say what I (unintelligible) that I made the record with him like nobody's business last night.EHRLICHMAN:Well, he's got every incentive, so.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Well, now in, in seeing Dean now,... PRESIDENT:Yeah, but the question is...EHRLICHMAN:...I think uh, uh, the point is that in, in,uh, taking these letters from him, uh, it would be the agreement that neither he noryou would announce it immediately.PRESIDENT:No. EHRLICHMAN:So the announcement would bein yourdiscretion,...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...and the decision would be in yourdiscretion as to which wayyou go.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:But that in view -and you might ask himwhether he intends to plead guilty or not.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Or...EHRLICHMAN:Or not guilty, Because that will weigh...PRESIDENT: Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...in your, in your ultimate decision.APRIL 16, 1973 FROM 9:50 TO 9:59 A.M.11PRESIDENT:That&#8482;s right, that&#8482;s right.HALDEMAN:Then we've got a cop out.

PRESIDENT:On the part of Ehrlichman, Colson and Dean, Isaid did you know; he said no. So at least his line on that is thathe didn&#8482;t know about itbefore, prior knowledge.EHRLICHMAN:OK. PRESIDENT:Only one point that, uh, occurs to me that uh,that, uh, he did discuss with me the, this need, forfunds for Hunt. At least I remember the...HALDEMAN: Yeah.PRESIDENT:Did he come in, who did he discuss that with,(unintelligible) that Hunt needed attorney fees.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:Did he do that to you personally?

Why?EHRLICHMAN:Because they felt that it would be damagingto the campaign.PRESIDENT:Oh, we all know that's a phony.EHRLICHMAN:But, somewhere, I think I did a memo on thatand I'm having it looked for now. But, inany event, uh, we made a kind of a fullcourt press at that time. Remember, we were at San Clemente and we were going to have McGregor come out there.PRESIDENT:Uh huh.EHRLICHMAN:And we had a lot of conversations on thephone and I blasted him and badgered him andurged him. And he dug his heels in and dughis heels in.HALDEMAN:At least five times during this period, Iwould get Dean into my office or he&#8482;d comein you know, with his problems and stuff.And we'd go through the whole thing. I spoke to you of this a couple of, of those times at least. I said, "John, why don&#8482;tyou just put the whole thing out and go withit.&#64258; He said, "Oh no, we can&#8482;t do that.&#64258; And he can&#8482;t -he knows...PRESIDENT:What is the story behind what happened onthat, on that fee for, for representing, the last thing for, for Hunt.
