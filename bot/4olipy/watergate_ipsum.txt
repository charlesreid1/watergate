Mitchell, higher than Mitchell.. &#64258; Dean said," It may further involve you.  The best one I know is Hugh Schwartz, he's a Democrat (unintelligible).  Dean and me part time on the 21st and with Mitchell on the22nd, and that was it, you never met with himagain except at Camp David.  We can get it in cash.

Haldeman said to have Strachan get the money but to clear it as soon aspossible. " Same.  Strachan did get the money out but got no receipt.  That one is, is that he, he'll be by himself unless they give himimmunity, then we have an interesting problem.

PRESIDENT: And, ah, the Ellsberg thing blows, 114 Ijust as soon, you know, just as.

HALDEMAN: You met with Ehrlichman and me.. ..

EHRLICHMAN: Yeah.

PRESIDENT: We did have. Mitchell..

HALDEMA: N And why were we using private people? Because the question, there was a valid, or,a real question here as to where the CIA and the FBI fit into it..  But the, the, the problem isMagruder can't take care of himself, except with this straight line-- his, his present,uh, position.

HALDEMAN: Yes, sir..  It can't hurt anything.

EHRLICHMAN: We're going to have to gather thisinformation in that's available to the President..

PRESIDENT: Get that list for me..

HALDEMAN: Well, I think people want solutions; theydon't want ongoing problems.. Uh, and that's one view.

PRESIDENT: Yeah, because apparently he made a telephonecall, it is alleged, in order to quash anindictment on the, allegedly against Vesco, so.  Well,that-- Yeah, that's right! And that, uh,and that there's been a hell of a damn lousy investigation.  -- and Mitchell,too -- "You can't do that.  Nine hundred thousand went into the pockets of the Scotts-, er,uh, Communists..

PRESIDENT: That's the point..

DEAN: Yes, sir..  No, I didn't.. .. know, if, ifthis is what you are going to.  Now the setof questions I've developed are not the kindthe press can ignore.. Because it's a one way street right now --. If you want me to go up and testify, I will. ".

PRESIDENT: I see.  Now (laughs), uh, Colson comes inwith, uh--I don't know whether this is, uh, how much of this is Colson, how much is the administrative, the administrative assistant of Baker's.
