(Pause) I don't know, well,anyway it's all right. (Loud Noise) Do youthink it helps some?EHRLICHMAN:I think it does. And, and I think-- PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Ron&#8482;s trying to get some questions, Ron'sgoing to get up there. Well, Ron, you're not going to apply this to specificinstances. What are you trying to say tous? And he again could come back and say, what I am saying to you is that the mistake that people are making, there&#8482;s a mistakenimpression that the White House is trying tocover up in this matter--is just a mistake.MARCH 30, 1973, FROM 12:02 TO 12:18 P.M.10PRESIDENT:Listen, I, I, I'd almost start thisstatement-I just want to lay to rest, uh,what I, what I think is a, what is a, a, I'mnot making any charges of how it happened. I want to lay to rest a massive, uh, uh, uh,uh, misapprehension that has been created inthe press, uh, created in the country, uh, with regard to the White House position, uh, uh, on the Watergate matter. Uh, theaftermath. That is, that because of, uh, uh,because of our, uh, and that is, uh, we are attempting, the position is to withholdinformation and to cover up, this is totallytrue--you could. say that this is totally untrue. I think I'd start right out that massive misapprehension and so forth and soon. (Pause)ZIECLER:Cover up and withhold information. PRESIDENT:Cover up--withhold information. ZIEGLER:And then bang into it.EHRLICHMAN:Mmmm, huh.ZIEGLER:But (unintelligible). Part of the case isbuilt on the fact the fellows left this roomand your press reports is not the place towork this out.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah. That's it exactly. EHRLICHMAN:And our refusal to--our refusal to try thiscase in the newspapers...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...has lead to--MARCH 30, 1973, FROM 12:02 TO 12:18 P.M.11PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah. Now, I&#8482;d say our, our, now, apart of that, I must say, due to the factour refusal to try the case in thenewspapers uh, to try this matter in the newspapers, and uh, the position, uh, of,of, of, uh, maintaining the constitutional,the President's necessity of maintaining the constitutional separation of powers. But, as the President, I'd say, as the Presidentmade crystal clear in his press conferenceon August second, the purpose of his, insistence on the separation of powers isnot to cover up. There will be total coop,and complete cooperation with the agencies of government, the uh, to uh, to uh, get at the facts. And the facts can be obtainedand still maintain the principle ofseparation of powers. And all the facts can be obtained. Something like that's--EHRLICHMAN:That's in there I think pretty good.(Loud Noise)PRESIDENT:You don&#8482;t want to make a sworn statement,huh?EHRLICHMAN:I would just as soon not. I, uh, think weare better off not, oh, doing up a stream. Look at the-PRESIDENT:The only position that I am concerned aboutis this. I wonder if you could takewhatever Ron says and--EHRLICHMAN:We're going to hypo it. We're going to getit around.PRESIDENT:Get it to the Congress. EHRLICHMAN: Right. PRESIDENT:Get it to the--George Bush.EHRLICHMAN:Right. I'm going to see the guys that aregoing to do that and (tape noise) I'll do it now.MARCH 30, 1973, FROM 12:02 TO 12:18 P.M.12PRESIDENT:All right, fine. If you could work on thatbetween now and three o'clock I think itwould be very helpful.EHRLICHMAN:I shall. PRESIDENT:Fine. You work on it and I'll take off(unintelligible).(Noise)
