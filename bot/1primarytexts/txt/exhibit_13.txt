TRANSCRIPT OF A RECORDING OF AMEETING AMONG THE PRESIDENT, JOHNDEAN, JOHN EHRLICHMAN, AND H.R.HALDEMAN ON MARCH 21, 1973, FROM5:20 TO 6:01 PM(Noise)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Well, you go round and round and you come upwith all questions and no answers. Backed up where you were at when you started.PRESIDENT:That's where we were this morning. Well, uh,anything additional to rush here?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I, I just don't think that the immunitything will wash.PRESIDENT:And the Grand Jury.EHRLICHMAN:It may, if you come to--HALDEMAN:Well, the immunity itself--We'll just cut offnever ending...ERLICHMAN:Well, under this procedure of John's, uh,John's grand jury package was, uh, was, uhPRESIDENT:To give immunity to whom? EHRLICHMAN:To various witnessesPRESIDENT:...who go before the Grand Jury.EHRLICHMAN:I, I think we have to figure that that is outof the picture. I just don't think that it,that it can be carried off.HALDEMAN:Well, either the Grand Jury or you can try bysetting up a special panel, 'cause you--DEAN:The special panel could investigate and reportback on the whole thing. Have them (unintel-ligible) immunize witnesses so that all the information can be obtained, and, uh--PRESIDENT:Maybe the appointment of a Presidential panel?MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM2DEAN:I would think it would be too--well that wouldtake special legislation to get immunitypowers, whereas the Department of Justice rightnow possesses the, the ability to grant immunity.PRESIDENT:Well, let's take the Grand Jury withoutimmunity, what about that?DEAN:Well-- PRESIDENT:That was your idea of getting out of it.EHRLICHMAN: Yeah. Well, I think that, uh, uh, is still apossibility. It leads to some very drastic results. Counsel over here has been reading some statutes, and, uh, there are awfulopportunities for indictment, and, uh-- so,uh...DEAN:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...you end up with people in and out of theWhite House indicted for various, for various offenses. (unintelligible overlaid.)HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) still plenty of these guys(unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:That's right. Now the other, now the otherroute--PRESIDENT:That is, if we're not, not mentioning that uh--EHRLICHMAN:I wouldn't, uh, I wouldn't spend too much timewith that, I, I give up there. Uh, the other route would be two papers, or possibly three,and these papers would say, "Mr. President, youasked me about this thing. Here's my, here's my review of the fact." And, uh, I think we disagree as to whether or not that's a viableoption or not. I. I think you could put outMARCH 21 1973 FROM 5:20 to 6:01 PM3 (Repl. 10/18/74)out a fairly credible document that would standup, and that will have the effect of trimmingthe scope, and would have the effect of maybebecoming the battleground on a reduced scope, which I think is important. But, uh, the big danger in the Ervin hearings, as I see it, isthat they will, they will run out, uh, leadsinto areas that, that it would be better not to have to get into. But, uh, if, uh, Baker, youknow, under his direction--Uh, and if you couldput out a basic document that would, uh, define a limited set of issues, uh, even if you, don't try to concentrate on target, you just mighthave something, some-- but obviously, youhaven't any way of imposing a lot of s--PRESIDENT:But, does, uh, does anybody, uh, really think,really think that really we should do nothing?That's the other, I mean, that's the option, period. If, uh-keep fighting it out on this ground if it takes all summer. you don't tryto concentrate on target, you Just might havesomething, some-but obviously, you haven't any way of imposing a lot of s--HALDEMAN:Which it will.PRESIDENT:That's the other -- in other words, the, thecontainment thing.EHRLICHMAN:Well, we've talked about that. We talkedabout, uh, possible opportunities in theSenate, that, that may turn up that we don't foresee now. In other words, that you go in and start playing for the odds. Keep trying toput out fires here and there. The problem ofthe Hunt thing and, and, uh, possibly McCord and some of these other people breaking isthere's no, uh, there is, there's no, uh, signoff on that ever. It just goes on and on and on.PRESIDENT:That's right. Well if that's the case then,uh, what is your view as to what we should donow about Hunt, and so forth?MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM4EHRLICHMAN:Well, my, my view is that, that, uh, Hunt'sinterests lie in getting a pardon if he can.That ought to be, somehow or another, one ofthe options that he is most particularly concerned about. Uh, his, his indirect contacts with John don't contemplate that atall. Well, maybe they, maybe they contemplateit--but they say there's going to be some problem.PRESIDENT:I know.DEAN:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:They think that, that's already understood. PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:Uh--PRESIDENT:I mean he's got to get that by Christmas time. DEAN:That's right. But, uh--EHRLICHMAN:And if he doesn't, obviously, uh, he's got tofigure he gets crosswise.PRESIDENT:If that blows. EHRLICHMAN:If that blows and, and that's, it seems to me,that the, uh--although at lea--It obviously isunderstood, that he has really gone over the ground with his attorney, that's in there.PRESIDENT:However, can he, by talking, uh, get pardoned?Get, get clemency from the court?DEAN:That's one of the options he's obviouslylooking at now. He comes in and tells thisjudge before sentencing, "Your Honor"-- and theJudge is likely to call him in before sentencing--and says, "Your Honor, I am willing to tell all. Uh, I don't want to go to jail.I have pleaded guilty to an offense. I'll takethat plea. I don't want to go to Jail. I'll cooperate with you and the government in anywayMARCH 21,1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM5DEAN:possible. I'll tell you everything I know."(cont.)I think the Judge would probably uh, uh, lookupon that very favorably; it would pay somebodyto tell him.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED: So then now-- PRESIDENT:So the point we have to, the bridge you have tocut, uh, cross there is, uh, which you've gotto cross, I understand, quite soon, is whether, uh, we, uh, what you do about, uh, his presentdemand. Now, what, what, uh, what about that?DEAN:Well, apparently Mitchell and, and, uh, uh... UNIDENTIFIED:La Rue. DEAN:...La Rue are now aware of it, so they knowwhat he is feeling.PRESIDEMT:True. We have to do something.DEAN:I, I have, I have not talked with either. Ithink they are in a position to do something though.PRESIDENT:It's a long road, isn't it? I mean, the wayyou look back on that, as John has pointed out here is that that's a, that's a, that's a long road.DEAN:It sure is.PRESIDENT:For all of us, for all of us. I mean, what thehell you going to do? (Unintelligible) That's why you're, that's why you, you're sort ofwrestling with the idea of moving in anotherdirection.DEAN:That's right. Uh, 'cause it's not only thatgroup, but within this circle of people who hadtidbits of knowledge, there are a lot of weakindividuals and any one of those could cause it to blow: the secretary to Gordon Liddy, uh...MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM6PRESIDENT:Sloan.DEAN:...the secretary to, uh, to Jeb Magruder.PRESIDENT:Sloan.DEAN:Chuck Colson's secretary, they will undoubtablycall her before the Senate Committee. And it's not, it's not only one forum. There's thecivil suit filed by O'Brien which, uh, for somereason we can't get settled. They are holding on to it. They are going to have uh, intensecivil discovery. They may well work hand inglove with that Senate Committee. They're going to go out and take depositions and start leaking things and you get inconsistencies.Leak what's in the transcript of one and seewho breaks out in the other. There are all kinds of things they've got going right nowthat, uh, would mean, uh, we've got to holdthis thing together. And the other thing I must say I've noticed is there is a, there's an attitude that has grown amongst all the peoplethat have been involved in this thing toprotect their own behinds. You know they're starting to go out and hire counsel right now.HALDEMAN:They're starting to do that?DEAN:Oh yeah. Uh, Dwight, for example now wants alawyer; uh, uh, (sharp noise) Kalmbach has hired himself a lawyer; (noise) Colson hasretained a lawyer; and now that we've knownenough of these things enough to know that (noise) self-protection is setting in.PRESIDENT:Well, let's not trust them.DEAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:Maybe we face the situation, but we can't do adamned thing about the participants, who wouldget it eventually, (unintelligible) why notnow?MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM7DEAN:Well, that--PRESIDENT:That's, that's what you're sort of resigned todo.DEAN:Well, my thought is that if it's going to come,it should come in a way that would not harm you and, uh, the individuals bear part of it.PRESIDENT:Well, we don't want to harm the people either.That's my concern. Well--survives the--well, we can't, we can't harm the, uh, these youngpeople I mean I'm damned concerned about allthese people that were all working in the White House.DEAN:For my part--PRESIDENT:Whatever they considered to be the bestinterests of the country, and so forth. I've never, I haven't any question as to--HALDEMAN:That's right, we don't have any question hereof some guy stashing money in his pocket.SEVERALVOICES:(Unintelligible)PRESIDEMT:(Unintelligible) it isn't something, it isn't,it isn't something like Hiss, for example, God- damned treason. Something (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Or like Sherman Adams, (coughs) doing it forhis own comfort, or uh, Albert Fall, doing itfor his own enrichment.PRESIDENT:Yeah. That's right. That's the point. That'swhy I say I'm, I'm going to take a lot of theheat. (Coughs) Well, we have to realize that,uh, the attrition is going to be rather considerable. That, that's your point, isn't it?MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM8DEAN:I think it, it's hard to prevent. Now that'swhy I raise the point of, of this immunityconcert again. That would take a lot of heat.Obviously, to do something like that. But it also(unintelligible) you find cannot be structured, that you're con--, you're concernedabout, there's something lurking here that hasbeen brought to your attention of recent. Uh, now is the time to get the facts. People havebeen protecting themselves. Dean couldn't getall the information. People wouldn't give it to him. Uh, there are indications now that there are other trends, and you'd like to getall this information and lay it before thepublic, but it's not going to come out if people are going to take the Fifth Amendmentbefore a Grand Jury. It'll never be proven.I--PRESIDENT:And it isn't going to come out of a committee. DEAN:It's not going to come out of a committee,either. Uh, for those reasons--PRESIDENT:Not in a fair way, that's the point. DEAN:True. That's right. Now--Or it may never comeout. They may--They will probably never get itout either, regardless of how clever they are. But now's the time to pull it allHALDEMAN:Plus, they're not going to have the keywitnesses.DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:That's right. DEAN:So therefore, you, you select a panel of, saythe Deputy Attorney General, the head of theCriminal Division, the head of the Civil Division, something like that, to call overMARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM9DEAN:everybody in the White House, and tell them(cont.)that we want, "I have been instructed by thePresident, we're to put together exactly whathappened. You won't be prosecuted for it because, uh, that's not the point now. The point is to get out all this information." Andthen you'll make a decision, based on what youlearn, whether people can remain in the government or not. And if it's bad, uh,they'll be removed, they'll be forced toresign. If it's something that, uh, is palatable, they'll go on with their job.HALDEMAN:The hue and cry would be that, "This is, thisis a super cover-up. Before they were justtrying to cover up the, the information. Now they realize they've got guilty people, so they, they've immunized them so that they can'tbe prosecuted."DEAN:I'm not just sure how many people would comeout guilty.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, well (unintelligible). The perception isthe important thing.PRESIDENT:Yeah, but the point is, were we talking-- DEAN:All right, is that, is that better? Or is itbetter to have, you know, just, just keep goingand have the thing build up and all of a suddencollapse? And, then people get indicted, and people, uh, get tarnished.PRESIDENT:After we've stonewalled it?DEAN:After we've stonewalled it, and after thePresident's been accused of covering up that way.PRESIDENT:That's the point.EHRLICHMAN:Or is there another way?PRESIDENT:Yeah, like--? EHRLICRMAN:Like the, the Dean statements, where thePresident then makes a full disclosure ofMARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM10EHRLICHMAN,CONT.:everything which he then has. And is in aposition if it does collapse at a later time tosay, "Jesus, I had the FBI, and the Grand Jury, and I had my own Counsel. I turned over every rock I could find. And I rested my confidencein these people in good faith and it's obviousnow--'PRESIDENT:The middle ground thing would be--I mean I'vebeen around, we've been around on that onequite a bit--the middle ground would be that, uh, I mean, uh, naturally your, you having to live through it, have to be a bit sensitiveabout the way we're going to, we're--but I--That doesn't concern me. I mean it doesn't concern me, and I don't--I think as far as the public is concerned, it won't do much. Uh, ifyou, as the White House Counsel, John, uh, ondirection--uh, I ask for a written report, which I think, uh, that-- which is verygeneral, understand. Understand (laughs) Idon't want to get all that God-damned specific. I'm thinking now in far more general terms, having in mind the fact that the problem with aspecific report is that, uh, this proves thisone and that proves that one, and you just prove some you--just prove it all. But if youmake it quite general in terms of my, yourinvestigation indicates that this man did not do it, this man did not do it, this man did dothat. You are going to have to say that, John,you know, like the, uh, Segretti-Chapinbusiness--DEAN:Um huh. PRESIDENT:That has to be said. And, uh, and, so forth.And that under the circumstances, that, uh(unintelligible).RLICHMAN:Could he do this? To give some weight to that, could youattach as an appendix a list of the FBI reports to which youhad access: Interview with Kalmbach, interview with Segretti,interview withMARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM11EHRLICHMAN,CONT.:Chapin, and Magruder, and whoever, Dean, thewhole business. So that the President at somelater time is in a position to say, "I relied".DEAN:Not on Dean alone but on corroborated evidencethat Dean...EHRLICHMAN:That's right. It also helps with the Graysituation because it shows the use made of the FBI reports by you. He's reporting to the President. He can say in there, "I have notdisclosed the contents of these to anybodyelse."PRESIDENT:"Yes, I was, had access to reports for thepurpose of carrying out your instructions tofind out whether--" Because that is true.I've had--You're the man I have asked, "Well, now, who the hell has been involved here." Youreported it before, found that there was noreflection on anybody (unintelligible) at this point. Uh, but, uh--(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:I think that the President's in a strongerposition later, and the Presidency is in a stronger position later, if he can be shown to have justifiably relied on you at this point intime.DEAN:Well, there's the argument now that Dean'scredibility is in question, uh, as a result of the Gray hearings. Maybe I shouldn't do it.Maybe someone who has--EHREICHMAN:This will rehabilitate you, though. Yourcredibility--PRESIDENT:No, as a matter of fact, John, I don't thinkyour credibility is in much jeopardy. Sure,your're under attack, but they want you up there to testify. I don't think it's theMARCH 21 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM12PRESIDENT,CONT.:credibility. They want you to testify. I, uh,I would not be too sensitive about that, Ithink that you would, you'd make a hell of a good impression, really.EHRLICHMAN:Beyond that, you can, you can help your, yourparticipation in the interviews by saying, uh,that, in addition to having seen the, uh, FBI synopses, you were present at the time of the interview of a number...DEAN:That's right.EHPLICHMAN:...of the witnesses, and... DEAN:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:...you yourself conducted interviews of others--PRESIDENT:(unintelligible) say "I conducted interviews ofthe following people, d--, d--, d--, d--," uh- I'm Just trying to (unintelligible).(Unintelligible)UNIDENTIFIED:Huh? HALDEMAN:Turn all that into a puzzle. EHRLICHMAN:Absolutely. PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICRMAN:You were doing this in furtherance...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...of your role-- PRESIDENT:And also, that you, that there's been such a, alot of crap put out about, uh, what you havedone that, uh, without referring to the fact,without being a bit defensive about it, uh, that, you know, that you, you intended to dothe letter. The letter--which would not be aletter to Eastland. I think that at this point it would be a letter from Dean to me, and you'd say that, "Now that the, "--and you would baseit on the fact, "Now that the hearings, nowthat the Watergate is, is done, I can now give a report about any progress of the..."MARCH 21 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM13EHRLICHMAN:Well, now that's what you should say. In otherwords, he gives the report because you askedhim for it, regardless of the timeliness.DEAN:Yeah, the only problem with that is that ifHunt and, uh not Hunt, if Liddy and McCord are still out on appeal, they may not be sentencedon Friday...PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:...(unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Then I wouldn't get into that. I think youcould say that, you could say...UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...uh, "I have a report. I don't mind showingit to Ervin. I wouldn't want it publishedbecause some fellow's trial--the case is still around."PRESIDENT:Well, let me say, the problem with that is, uh,I don't believe that helps on our cause. In light of the fact that--well, uh, let me just-- I am not sure, maybe I am wrong--the fact thatthe President says, "I've shown Ervin thereport." We've got to remember that we have, we have nobody there. I think something has to(unintelligible) where...EHRLICHMAN:Fine (Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:...where we can put out something to thepublic.HALDEMAN:if you're worried about the timeliness, andtrying to hang it to the--on the sentencing, we don't really have to do that. We're going to say we just ignore the trialPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and say you have been-and we've been. thethis-- the point is established anyway. Deanhas given you a report. We, we basically saidit's an oral report. You can put theMARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM14HALDEMAN,CONT.thing that Dean has kept you posted from timeto time with periodic oral reports as, uh, onthis thing, as, as it, uh, uh, it becomes available...DEAN:Right. HALDEMAN:...and so forth. You have asked him...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...now, uh, to summarize those... PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...into an overall summary.PRESIDENT:Overall summary, and I am making the reportavailable to the Ervin Committee. Very public.SEVERALVOICES:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:And, and, and I again offer the ErvinCommittee, I offer the Ervin Committee, uh, I'd say, "Dear Senator Ervin," I'd say, "here, hereis the report, it is before your hearings, Iwant you to have it, complete access, and, as Ihave said previously, that any, any questions that are not answered here, any member of the White House staff, they will be directed toanswer any, uhHALDEMAN:Informal. PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Good.PRESIDENT:...on that basis." Well, we've run that bybefore, John.EHRLICHMAN:Well, we've said it's formal and informal... PRESIDENT:Yeah.MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM15EHRLICHMAN:...in the statement and that's uh,PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:But let's suppose you did the damn thing. Imean, you did it as to the burglary, and youdid it as to...PRESIDENT:Segretti. EHRLICHYAN:...and you make some passing reference tomoney, correct? (pause) And then you send herup there. Uh, then let's suppose Hunt blows at some time. Our position on that is that, uh, "Hunt was an investigator. He was sent out todo an investigation on Ellsberg. Uh, when wediscovered what he was up to, we stopped him." (Coughs) Now, I suppose that lets Ellsberg out,that's an illegal search and seizure that maybe sufficient at least for a mistrial, if not for--PRESIDENT:Isn't it damn near through yet?EHRLICHMAN:Pardon?PRESIDENT:Isn't that case about finished? EHRLICHMAN:Oh, it'll go on a while yet. Uh--HALDEMAN:Can he get a mistrial after a conviction?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, sure. Uh, well, let's, let's supposethat occurred. Uh, that was a national security situation. Uh, Hunt exercised badjudgment, and I think it's arguable that heshould never have been permitted to go to the Committee after that episode, having, having, uh, reflected on his judgment that way. But,uh, beyond that, the question is, did we, didwe authorize it, did we condone it...MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM16PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...did we support it? And that kind of thing.PRESIDENT:And that's that part of it. Getting back tothe, uh, getting back to this, John, uh, you still sort of tilt to the panel idea yourself?DEAN:Well, I'm still, I see in, in this conversationthe things that we've, you know, thought ofbefore, we've talked about before. But they do not ultimately solve what I see as the graveproblem of a cancer growing around thePresidency, and that the cancer is going to continue to grow. This is just another thing that gives a problem. It does not clean theproblem out.EHRLICHMAN:Well, but doesn't it give, doesn't it permitthe President to clean it out at such time asit does come up? By saying, "Indeed, I reliedon it. And now this, this later thing turns up, and I don't condone that. And if I'd known about that before, obviously I wouldn't havedone it. And I'm going to move on it now."PRESIDENT:Your point, John, is the, the--you really thinkyou've got to clean the cancer out now, right?DEAN:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:And, uh, how would you do that? You come backagain for another round. You see no other, you see no other way that, uh, you, you, you--without the, without setting a, withoutbreaking down on executive privilege, of course.MARCH 21 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM17DEAN:I see that, yeah, yeah, there a couple of waysto do it.PRESIDENT:You certainly don't want to do it at theSenate, though, do you?DEAN:No, sir. PRESIDENT:All right.DEAN:I think that would be an added trap.PRESIDENT:That's the, that's the worst thing. DEAN:Right. Uh--PRESIDENT:We've got to do it.DEAN:We've got to do it. You have to do it, to getthe credit for it. Uh, that, that gets you above it. Uh, as I see it, that means peoplegetting hurt, and I hope we can find the answerto that problem.EHRLICHMAN:All right, suppose we did this? Supposing yourendered a report to the President oneverything you know about this. And the President then fires some people. Step one. Step two, sends the report over to the JusticeDepartment, then says, "I've been diligently atwork on this. My Counsel's been diligently at work. Here are his findings."(Pause)PRESIDENT:Where would you stop it? (Pause) With, uh,Magruder over in Commerce?EHRLICHMAN:Christ, I don't know where it stops. You know,uh--UNIDENTIFIED:(Unintelligible) Ziegler? EHRLICHMAN:Christ, that's-- HALDEMAN:It's probably going to be with Magruder.PRESIDENT:No.MARCH 21, 1973 EROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM18HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) send it over to Justice.EHRLICHMAN:Well, if you send the report over, and it saysMagruder did this and this.PRESIDENT:Well, yeah, but-- EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's what he's, that's what he istalking about.DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:And then Magruder, though, is a, is a fellowthat's a...EHPLICHMAN:A free agent, at this point.PRESIDENT:...is a free agent, according to John, who'dsay, uh-he'd pull others down with him.EHRLICHMAN:Sure.DEAN:Well, now, what you, what you do--HALDEMAN:You don't know that he would, but you sure ashell have got to assume he would,EHRLICHMAN:Why, of course.DEAN:I think what you could do is you could dropnumbers, with names on them, in a hat, you can draw them out to see who gets hurt and whodoesn't. (laughs) Well, that's about as fairas you could he.EHRHLICHMAN:The minute you--PRESIDENT:Strachan. Do the same to him with it.DEAN:Strachan? PRESIDENT:Maybe; not so much. UNIDENTIFIED:Maybe Jeb...DEAN:(Unintelligible) I think he has a problem.MARCH 21. 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM19PRESIDENT:Uh, the problem of knowledge of it.HALDEMAN:He has a problem of knowledge. Magruder has aproblem of actionPRESIDENT:Action and perjury. EHRLICHMAN:Well, Strachan found the money. That's theproblem.DEAN:No.HALDEMAN:Not really.(Pause)DEAN:The thing that we'd like, you know, to happen,if possible, to do this, is--Hunt has now sent a blackmail request directly to the White House.PRESIDENT:Who'd he send it--to you?DEAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Or to me?DEAM:To your counsel.PRESIDENT:Uh huh. HALDEMAN:That's the interesting kind of thing, there'ssomething there that maybe we blow it all upthat way, and there go all the--and everythingstarts going in a while new direction.DEAN:That would hurt but he's, he's committing anoffense. Right there. That is blackmail.HALDEMAN:Yeah, John, but where does that take you? Thattakes you to your support of other people who are not fully aware of the (unintelligible)DEAN:That's right.HALDEMAN:But we didn't know about that. UNIDENTIFIED:That's a fact. We're above that.MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM20DEAN:But, then again, you have to get the problem ofpeople, what they're going to say--(whistles).EHRLICHMAN:Well, if you go your route, you can't draw theline someplace---DEAN:No, no. EHRLICHMAN:You can't then say, you know, we're going to,we're going to reserve that, we've got to letit all--PRESIDENT:You see, if you go your route of the ca--, ofgetting, cutting, cutting the cancer out, thequestion is would you cut it out now is, uh, is, is, is, uh--take a HuntDEAN:Well--PRESIDENT:You can't just knock the hell out o&#163; him, canyou?DEAN:That's right.HALDEMAN:Well, if you take your route and it goes as alogical one you have a certainty, almost, of Magruder going to jail, Chapin going to jail, you going to JailPRESIDENT:No.HALDEMAN:...probably me going to jail. PRESIDENT:Uh, again, I question the last two.HALDEMAN:Certainly Chapin. Certainly Strachan. No, notreally.DEAN:Not necessarily, uh-- UNIDENTIFIED:Not Chapin.HALDEMAN:Chapin and Strachan are clean. Well, so isStrachan.EHRLICHMAN:I think Strachan is hooked on, on this money.MARCH 21 1973 FROM 5:20 to 6:01 PM21 (Repl. 10/15/74)PRESIDENT:What money was that?EHRLICHMAN:He is an accessory in a, in a undeclaredcampaign fund.HALDEMAN:That's no--That, that's--the only guyresponsible for that is the treasurer.EHRLICHMAN:I know.HALDEMAN:Sure.EHRLICHMAN:But not under the law. PRESIDENT:Well that was un--, undeclared for a while, Ithink it was '70, '68.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. But then it got back into the coffersand, uh, was used in this campaign.DEAN:Let's say, let's say the President sent me tothe Grand Jury to make a report. Who would be,who would, who could I actually do anything to, or cause any problems for? As a practicalmatter, first-hand knowledge, uh, almost noone. All I could do is to give them a focus plus leads.PRESIDENT:Right. Right.EHRLICHMAN:They they start following the leads.DEAN:That's right, and where they ultimately comedown is, or--(Pause) There, there again is, is,is the--We don't have anybody to talk tosomebody who understands the process, I mean. I was talking outside with Bob about Henry Petersen. Uh, we just have to have somebodywho, talk to somebody that, that, can reallybreak in and say "Henry, what does this mean in the criminal justice system? What kind of case could be made on this? What kind of offenseswould evolve out of that?" We have got apretty good idea of most of the statutes that are involved, but there, uh, there is so muchbehind the statues.March 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM22PRESIDENT:Do you want to bring him in? Talk to him?Well, if you do that, you will suit theAttorney General.DEAN:Well, you're putting in, you're putting in hisknowledge.PRESIDENT:I see.DEAN:Uh, we'll have to play with that.HALDEMAN:If you do it hypothetically DEAN:Right.HALDEMAN:...you've got, you've got this brother-in-lawwho has this problem in school. (Laughs)PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:He told this wild scenario that I'd like you--PRESIDENT:Yeah.SEVERALVOICES:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:My friend is writing a play, and unless he, un--(17 second Noise and Pause)DEAN:Uh, but, it bothers me to do anything furthernow, in the situation, when Hunt's our realhang-up.PRESIDENT:Well, now, do you think; a statement promptshim.DEAN:Yes, sir, I do. It doesn't solve it. It'sJust one more step.HALDEMAN:The payment to Hunt does too.MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM23PRESIDENT:The payment to Hunt does, yeah.(Pause)DEAN:Maybe that's what-That's why I say, you know,somebody to assess the criminal liability. Maybe we are misassessing it.(Pause)PRESIDENT:Well, I really don't know, will Petersen--?Would you confide in him?UNIDENTIFIED:I think I would.PRESIDENT:How else could you do it?EHRLICHMAN:You could start down that road. You could say,"Henry, I want to, I want to talk to you about, uh, questions that arise in the course of myinvestigation, but I have to swear you tosecrecy." If he'll take it on that basis.DEAN:Is the answer (unintelligible) say, "Uh, I wantto know if you can talk to me off the record."(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:You immediately eliminate one of your options.(Pause) You can, well, you can eliminate theoption of the President being able to take theposition he knew nothing about it.PRESIDENT:Yeah. (Pause) Uh, so, so you, uh, you seethen that, uh, you don't see the, uh, you don'tsee the statement thing, uh, helping insofar as the, the--be of any way--the, uh--helping insofar as-- you, you, you must--you think thatover some more.DEAN:Yes, sir. I see it as the temporary answer. PRESIDENT:I agree with that. But the point is to, uh,but you see, here's the, the way I would seethe statement that we could say we get out.MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM24PRESIDENT:Our--Everything we would intend to say, or, orwe could get out a general statement as I havealready indicated, would get out a, with regardto the fact that we spent looking into the God damn thing, it's really--and I've said it, we, we just can't, you, you know, withdraw, solet's forget a withdrawal at this point. Andsecondly, again, the offer for White House people to cooperate so that we're not coveringup that sort of thing. And that still leavesit, however, in the hands of the Committee. I agree. A statement, at least, would, it's true, temporary, but it, uh, would indicate thePresident has looked into the matter, has hadhis Counsel report to him and this is the result of that, uh, now let the Committee dotheir damnedest. We will cooperate. And theCommittee will say, "No." And so we'll just stand right there.DEAN:Well, that will really (sighs), I think whatwill, will prompt a new problem will be Siricagiving a speech from the bench on Friday when he sentences.PRESIDENT:Yeah.DEAN:I think he will charge that he cannot believethe trial was conducted (unintelligible government presented a limited case. That heis not convinced the case represents the fullsituation.HALDEMAN:In other words, uh-- DEAN:I know it. But I think it'll have a dramaticimpact on the day of...PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:...sentencing with Sirica from the bench...PRESIDENT:That's right.DEAN:...because he'll charge that there are higher-ups involved in this. He may take some dramatic action like, uh, you know, appoint aspecial prosecutor. Who knows?MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM25PRESIDENT:Can he do that?DEAN:Sure. I think he could.PRESIDENT:He could appoint a special prosecutor, forwhat? For--DEAN:To reopen the investigation. EHRLICHMAN:He is the presiding judge.DEAN:Yes, sir.EHRLICHMAN:He could, he could convene a grand jury. Or hesaid he couldDEAN:Well, the government is going to do that. Uh--PRESIDENT:The government's going to do that for what? DEAN:Right after sentence--, the week aftersentencing, they're going to take all thepeople who've been sentenced back before theGrand Jury--PRESIDENT:These same onesDEAN:These same ones. And see if they want, nowwant to talk. Sirica may--put, you know, (unintelligible) give them provisional sentences And say if they are helpful to thegovernment back before the Grand Jury, he'llreconsider the sentences, because...SEVERALVOICES:(Unintelligible)DEAN:...horrendous sentences.PRESIDENT:Suppose--Horrendous sentences I think we cananticipate. But, but, suppose he does that? Then where, where does that leave us then,John? Where does that leave us? You just say--EHRLICHMAN:Well, I don't think that's a surprise to theMARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM26EHRLICHMAN,CONT.:defendants. I think their counsel must haveprepared them for that.PRESIDENT:I'm--right. I wonder, however, however, interms of what about our, what about our position? In other words, we're damned by thecourts before Ervin could even get there.EHRLICHMAN:The, the only thing that we can say is forZiegler to say, "'Look, we've investigated backwards and forwards in the White House, andwe're satisfied on the basis of the report wehave that nobody in the White House has been involved in a burglary; nobody had notice ofit, knowledge of it, participated in theplanning, or aided or abetted it in any way."PRESIDENT:Well, that's what you could say. EHRLICHMAN:And it happens to be true... PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...as for that transaction.PRESIDENT:(Laughs) Sure. As for that transaction. Well,John, you, uh, you, uh, you must feel that's, uh, is enough.DEAN:I don't think it's good.EHRLICHMAN:Now, let's, let's try another, let's tryanother concommitant to that. Supposing Mitchell were to step out on that same day andwere to say, "I've been doing someinvestigation at 1701 and I find so and so, and so and so."PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) scope up. UNIDENTIFIED:Yes, sir.(Pause)EHRLICRMAN:And I don't know what he would say, but maybehe'd want to make some kind of a disclosure. And then what?MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 5:20 TO 6:01 PM27PRESIDENT:What the hell is he going to disclose thatisn't going to blow something? Yeah.HALDEMAN:Well (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Well, I'm going to have to-- UNIDENTIFIED:I (unintelligible) have to resolve it. PRESIDENT:I don't have any time. I'm sorry. I've got toleave. What is it--What have you got here?(unintelligible) (Noise) Well, uh, you meet what time tomorrow?HALDEMAN:I'm not sure. In the morning.DEAN:Morning.
