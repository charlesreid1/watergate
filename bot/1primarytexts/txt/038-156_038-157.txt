HALDEMAN ON APRIL 25, 1973FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)OPERATOR:Thank youPRESIDENT:Ya HALDEMAN:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:Is there any, uh, way that, uh, evensurreptitiously or discreetly or otherwise I mean, that, ah, way you could determine whether uh, this matter of whether I Dean--might have walked in there with a recorderon him? I don't know.HALDEMAN:No, I don't think there is any way. I thinkya gotta, so remote as to be almost beyondpossibility. And uh, and if he did (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well we've gotta I mean, its, it(unintelligible), but the point is thatthat's ah, that's a real bomb isn't it?,HALDEMAN:Ah, ya. PRESIDENT:Sure is. -That, that's what may be his,bomb. In other words he (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:No... PRESIDENT:Put that on the desk, with Henry Petersen,and says, &#64258;I gotta recording of thePresident of the United States and here&#8482;s what he said.&#64258;HALDEMAN:Well, that would be very hard.PRESIDENT:If he did it, then we'd say, &#64257;yes...&#64258;HALDEMAN;(Unintelligible) virtually impossibleAPRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.2PRESIDENT:"(Unintelligible) Not virtually impossible.'If he did it we'd say, "Yes, sir, that wasa recording and I was investigating...&#64258;HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:On the other hand (laughs) it'd be god damnhard on, I mean, he'd run that in the pressthat'd be (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Yeah PRESIDENT:Well, no way to, no way to find out isthere?HALDEMAN:No, there isn't any, there isn't any(unintelligible) no way anybody wouldknow...PRESIDENT:We have no... HALDEMAN:Except him. PRESIDENT:record of uh, we don't have any(unintelligible) as to whether he hasdone...HALDEMAN:None PRESIDENT:that before, have we?HALDEMAN:None. We have no evidence at any time underany circumstances, and I&#8482;ve, you know, been involved in enough, you know, what is goingon that I, I just find it impossible to,think that, that there would (unintelligible) you know, it could possibly be the case.PRESIDENT:Ummh. One thing about those things youthink that you know when a fellow walks into me, and I didn't look at him that closely,but you were there, god damn I mean, I, I&#8482;dthink that it&#8482;s a little, it&#8482;s, it&#8482;s, even the smallest ones are bulky enough that you mean, with a fellow like Dean you&#8482;d sort ofsee that wouldn&#8482;t ya, where do you carrythem, in your hip pocket or your,breast pocket?APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.3HALDEMAN:Oh, under your arm, you know, where theycarry a pistol holster or somethin.PRESIDENT:Um hmm, ya. Well...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) I really don't thinkit's--it's so remote as to be almost beyondthe...PRESIDENT:Ya, ya HALDEMAN:...realm of possibility PRESIDENT:In this matter nothing is beyond the realmof possibility. (laughter)...HALDEMAN:No, that's true but ah... PRESIDENT:Ya...HALDEMAN:And, and...PRESIDENT:But of course we draw the sword on that ifah, if ah...HALDEMAN:(clears throat) I think if, if that's thesubject he has in mind, that he, he's justgoing to do it on the basis of his own, you know, his own record afterwards, there's no check.PRESIDENT:Oh well, on that we'll destroy him.HALDEMAN:And ah... PRESIDENT:It&#8482;s his word against...HALDEMAN:You know from the big (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:His word against... HALDEMAN:Something like that... PRESIDENT:His word--what? His word against thePresident's the ah, the ah, (unintelligible)you were there but particularly the President's on that (unintelligible). Theonly other thing is of course hisconversation with regard to the, I mean, the little slipin your office about the...APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.4HALDEMAN:But that.PRESIDENT:That was so casual.HALDEMAN:I don't think you're going to have the, havethe problem with that. I mean, other than, other than perhaps an effort to, to base iton his conversation and you know, hismemorandum afterwards or had he done something like that, but. he didn't usually do that.PRESIDENT:Didn't he?HALDEMAN:Ummh ummh. PRESIDENT:He didn't write conversationsmemorandum?HALDEMAN:Not usually.PRESIDENT:Hm. He probably did on this one. But uh,(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:As I said it sounds as if he had notes whichyou, you said he thought he did to speakfrom you know he might have used that ah...PRESIDENT:Ya that, but I mean, but he didn't make anynotes in any conversation I ever had withhim, he always sat there and then probablyas a (unintelligible) with a good memory, you can go back and write everything downyou can remember.HALDEMAN:Ya, ya. PRESIDENT:But ah, he's always had or made a memorandumof the conversation afterwards and I saidthis and that, on the other hand, Zieglerhad a good point about Dean which he made a few days ago, he said John Dean'scredibility is nil because...APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.2HALDEMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:The Dean report has proved to be false andeverything else and...HALDEMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:And you have something to say and that'swhat we gotta have in mind here now withoutyou and John to get too god damned discouraged about this because basically John Dean, ah, his report, uh, that he nowclaims that he didn't make, his subornationof perjury, his everything elseHALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:He's ah, who the hell is to believe whathe's going to say now, and he's saying it now for what purpose? He's going to be, of course, saying, "Well I, they're making methe scape goat and all the rest, andtherefore I'm going to tell all," and he's going, and as he says, "I'll try this," his attorney says, "This administration right upto the President," he didn't say thePresident, but you know that's what they said.HALDEMAN:Yeah, but that's (unintelligible) thepurpose--when you get down to trying to do it, they got a very tough time.PRESIDENT:Purpose of course was to get everybody-whichnow the Prosecutor Chuck, Bob, is not aboutto give 'em.HALDEMAN:Really?PRESIDENT:No, sir, they're not. Oh, Petersen saysthat I said, "Now alright, you make your judgment on your own," I said,"not on my behalf. He said "No,' he says, "he'sjust--much involved.as a principal. We justcan't do it." And frankly I think it's just as well. I think if...APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.2HALDEMAN:He's right.PRESIDENT:I think if you--I think if you're in aposition now, that if you gave him immunity,he would sit there the rest of our lives.HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Hanging it over ya, and the point is thatah, now if he's going to have this pissing contest (unintelligible) all right, bring it out and fight it out and it'll be a bloodygod damn thing, you know in a strange kindof way that's life, isn't it (unintelligible)' probably be understood andbe rough as a cob, an we'll survive and somepeople you'll even find (unintelligible) in Mississippi you'll find a half a dozen people that will be for the President. Whoknows?HALDEMAN:(Laughs) Be a lot more than that. PRESIDENT:(unintelligible) No. We do still have somesupport in the country, I hope. But, uhHALDEMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:But we shall see, do you agree? HALDEMAN:Absolutely.PRESIDENT:(Laughs)HALDEMAN:No question. PRESIDENT:Ya, ya, that's right-Despite all the pollsand all the rest, I think there's still ahell of a lot of people out there, and fromwhat I've seen, they're-you know, they, they want to believe, that's the point, isn't it?APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.2HALDEMAN:Why sure. Want to, and do.PRESIDENT:All right. By the way, I thought there wasjust a th--thought that maybe. you couldcheck th-that thing...HALDEMAN:NoPRESIDENT:But there no way you can check it.HALDEMAN:There isn't anything to check. PRESIDENT:You've never heard that, uh, that he's everdone that before.HALDEMAN:Never, never.PRESIDENT:Um hmm. Although as I say, if worse comesto worse, an he has one, well, we've gotone. (Laughs).HALDEMAN:Yup. PRESIDENT:No. But what I mean is&#352;you&#8482;ve gotta livewith it, that's itHALDEMAN:Well know it's there at least, an uh--PRESIDENT:That's right, that's right, that's right.Tomorrow th-, th-, th-, there's a little left on what the one you had this day,right?HALDEMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:Um hmm. But-but you were there during thatdiscussion.HALDEMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:And I suppose that we probably discussed howthe hell we get the 120, right? I don tremember it.APRIL 25, 1973 FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.8HALDEMAN:No, no. I don't think so, I think it was,you know, just sort of a rehash of the otherthing...PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:and basically going into the impossibilityof doing it.PRESIDENT:And the next day you, I suppose the questionis, well, did you get the 120, I may have asked him that, I don't know. I don't thinkI did but I...(laughs).HALDEMAN:I'm not even sure there was a second. PRESIDENT:Well anyway&#352;-I listen to it tomorrow antlemme know. Will ya?HALDEMAN:Yep.
