Uh stand by--PRESIDENT:MagruderHALDEMAN:He has had him in there for forty-fiveminutes, but he still, he's-still there. Uh,I called Magruder - it took a long time toget him he was not available &#338; uh, and I finally got his office got, excuse me, but his lawyer said he could reach him in aboutan hour, which he did and had him, had himcall me. Well, Jeb said...APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 1:55 TO 2:13 P.M.4PRESIDENT:I don't want to come in.HALDEMAN:No. I said, I.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Started out by saying now there have beensome developments and we reviewed this wholething with the President and he thought itwas important that, that you and your lawyer meet with John Ehrlichman right away and just get up-to-date on where things standfrom this side. And uh, he said fine, I cando that, I can't make it 'til about four o'clock. That's the way it's left but hethen said Uh, you know this whole thing is,is, uh, he said, I don't know if you know the situation but it's all done now. And uh, I said, what do you mean? And he saidwell I decided last night, late last night,with my lawyers that I'm gonna, uh go ahead you told me to do what my lawyers told me to do. You said you couldn't advise me. And,and uh--my position--PRESIDENT:Is that what you told him? HALDEMAN:Yes sir; You see he called saying, what,what, what does, what does Bob want me todo? And, uh, I told Larry to tell him that I was not in a position to tell him what to do, that, that was, whatever, this was lastweek, that was a decision he had to make anduh, uh, work out with his own advisers. Uh, at that, you know I wasn't implying any(unintelligible) cutting him off--it wassimply that it was his area. Well anyway, uh, uh, he said they had decided last night that he, he would have to tell all and hislawyers met with Silbert today and informedSilbert that Magruder was ready to tell all and uh, requested an opportunity for him todo so. But heAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 1:55 TO 2:13 P.M.5doesn't know what the timing is but the planis that he will meet first with Silbert andreview what he is gonna say and then Silbertwill take it to the, then. Silbert will take it to The Grand Jury. Now, they cut adeal. Jeb said first Jeb said I did not askfor immunity because I didn't feel I was entitled to it. He said the reason that I tell everything is because they're gonna getit anyway. They've got witnesses onwitnesses now and there's no reason for me to be quiet because they don't, they've goteverything anyhow.PRESIDENT:How does he know that? Silbert's told him?, HALDEMAN:I guess Silbert's told his lawyers, and uh,this may be, it's a damn good prosecutinglawyer like SilbertPRESIDENT:Sure HALDEMAN:...to get a key witness to tumble, but uh... PRESIDENT:But immediately?HALDEMAN:Sure, they've got the facts they may not beable to prove them but they've got them. Magruder's testimony is proof. Uh, but, uh,he, he said the only, he said the only thingI gain out of this is, is the hope that uh, that I don't go up for, uh, all the counts they've got me on. He says they've got meon six or eight counts of perjury, uh, twocounts of conspiracy and two counts of uh, uh, obstruction of justice and uh,potentially, and that ends up with uh,sentences of 135 to 160 years in jail. He says I, my lawyers feel that if I open up on this and they've made a, had a discussionthey haven't made aAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 1:55 TO 2:13 P.M.6deal apparently, uh, with Silbert as to whatthey'll do uh, uh as he has been told thatthe way the process will work is that he'llgive his information and they'll determine from the information, what counts they'llseek to indict him on. They'll then takehim before the Grand Jury and uh, go for Grand Jury indictments on a limited number of counts and they'll try to work oncooperation and that kind of stuff tolighten his load and uh, he will then plead guilty on all counts. He, he will not standtrial. So he will not testify in publiccourt he will only testify to the Grand Jury and uh, whatever they bring as indictments he'll take guilty pleas on and go to jail.PRESIDENT:It isn't a fair trail. -HALDEMAN:He told me that whole thing in a, in an, anunbroken voice and uh, showed more strength than I thought he had, to be perfectlyfrank. He obviously worked his way throughit in his own mind. H'sPRESIDENT:Terrible.HALDEMAN:...Awful hard, it certainly is, yeah.PRESIDENT:Breaks ya up. HALDEMAN:Don't know what is involved --But its--Heunderstands it and he says the other thingyou got to understand, Bob, is that thiswhole thing is going down the drain he said everybody is gonna crumble. I, this I wouldsuspect these lawyers have talked to eachother.PRESIDENT:Me too.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 1:55 TO 2:13 P.M.7HALDEMAN:He said LaRue, everybody involved here is,is gonna to go with the-exception of John--PRESIDENT:Mitchell.HALDEMAN:Unfortunately, I had this conversation justas John Mitchell was driving up the drivewayI held, had Mitchell go to...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Ehrlichman, but Ehrlichman, then Ehrlichmanheard all of this before he went in withMitchell. Then, he has not, Jeb has nottold Mitchell of his decision yet he said, I want to make my decision and then my lawyerswere working it out with Silbert thismorning and then my next step is to tell John Mitchell which I want to do.PRESIDENT:How the hell can you keep it from John? Whatabout the White House spot?HALDEMAN:Jeb says unfortunately "I will to a degreeimplicate John Dean and to, possibly to some degree, Gordon and I hate to do it", but hesaid "where I am now there's nothing I, Ican't pull any punches."PRESIDENT:Shit.HALDEMAN:He said there is no way that anything I dowill get to you.PRESIDENT:John Dean or whoever does it. HALDEMAN:Well, John Dean (unintelligible) that, thatdoesn't trouble me I don't think it troublesDean where he gets John Dean is on his attendance at those meetings.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 1:55 TO 2:13 P.M.8PRESIDENT:Yeah, that meeting Satruday night?HALDEMAN:No, the problem there is that, that thediscussion at those meetings clearly andspecifically did involve bugging.PRESIDENT:Oh, well Dean never denied that says it'sturned off. That's John Dean's stand butwhat about the aftermath? Does the aftermath...HALDEMAN:NoPRESIDENT:...on Dean?HALDEMAN:I don't think Magruder knows about theaftermath.PRESIDENT:Where does he get to Gordon Strachan?HALDEMAN:Get. He says he gets Gordon on uh... PRESIDENT:...sending copies to him... HALDEMAN:...sending material to him. Uh, he stillimplies at least that Gordon knew about itbefore, you know, he knew what they were gonna do.PRESIDENT:In other words --HALDEMAN:Gordon tells me he did not.PRESIDENT:Did he say he will testify that he(unintelligible) sent materials down to theWhite House --that's the point.HALDEMAN:If he's asked, he will, yes. PRESIDENT:He'll be asked, right. Cause that's whatthey will say he sent to the White House andwhat would Strachan say?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 1:55 TO 2:13 P.M.9HALDEMAN:Strachan has no problem with that. He'llsay after the fact there Are materials thatI can now, uh, surmise were what he'sreferring to but they were not at the time identified in any way as being the result ofwiretaps and I did not know they were.There was a, they were amongst tons of stuff. Jeb makes the point. He said, I am sure Gordon never sent them to Bob becausethey were all trash. There was nothing in&#8218;em. He said the tragedy of this whole thing is that it produced nothing. (Pause)PRESIDENT:Who else did he send reports to - Mitchell?(Pause)HALDEMAN:The thing I got before was that he sent themeither to that one went to him and one wentto Strachan.PRESIDENT:Suppose our problem there is, uh, if, uh,they claim that the reports came to me in the White House basically they'll say toyour office what will you say then?HALDEMAN:They can. Remember, this doesn't ever haveto come out.PRESIDENT:I know, if they don't ask it in the GrandJury.HALDEMAN:if they do ask it in the Grand Jury... PRESIDENT:Why?HALDEMAN:...the Grand Jury is secret. The only wayit will come out is if they decide to indict Strachan and, and put him up for trial. He,Jeb, is (unintelligible) they have nointerest in Strachan at all - and they have all this stuff. But thatAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 1:55 TO 2:13 P.M.10they don't, they feel, and I can see whythey would -Strachan is a, is a, like asecretary. He's useful as a witness.PRESIDENT:That's his connection, Strachan, where hesent the materials.HALDEMAN:Yeah, he implies or has in, uh, earlierstuff he doesn't now, directly. He doesn't say anything now directly in his earlier stuff that Strachan knew about it beforehandStrachan knew they were bugging Watergate.Strachan says he didn't. and Jeb has implied a lot of things that I know aren'ttrue and other things that other people sayaren't true so I have no idea whether he believes now that, see I think one of the problems Jeb has is that he's not sure whatis true at this point.PRESIDENT:He tells you this? HALDEMAN:He tells me that he's sorry about thisbecause it will, it'll probably hurt DeanPRESIDENT:and StrachanHALDEMAN:and it may, and it may hurt Gordon. You seethat's the kind of thing, you know, from hisjudgment he's looking at things a littledifferent now. Now, he, he thought that there was a monumental problem if word ever got out that he, that he had doled $8,000out to buy Edith Evner books. Now I don'tconsider that a problem at all. (Pause) We know why we were buying them. We werebuying them to try and get it on the bestseller list. But, but the argument of why we were buying this is that it is a bookAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 1:55 TO 2:13 P.M.11that was of great interest to oursupporters. It was, it was used to givethem some background information; we boughta lot of copies then we could send to people, which we did.PRESIDENT:Has anything come out yet, uh, I hope thatsomething has implied that there, these copies are available to the Watergate or, ah, to the White House or not or has thatnot been said yet? He could have had but Isuppose not.HALDEMAN:I don't know. I am sure it's been implied.You know, all of us had, all of them hadaccess to everything. Now, the broad implication is clearly there.PRESIDENT:(Laugh) Everybody is sure trying to get inthe act. (Unintelligible) message here fromSteve that John Puttnam thought about the Watergate and had some ideas he would like to pass on.HALDEMAN:So Bebe tells him to call you direct. Just,Bebe knows better than that.PRESIDENT:Well, Bebe&#8482;s uh, I think listen to him veryoften he may have (unintelligible) the firsttime it's ever happened. I just hope thatSteve (unintelligible/REMOVED).HALDEMAN:(Laugh) The funny thing about all of thisour, our real problemPRESIDENT:here is with our friends, Bob, isn't it. HALDEMAN:Um hmm. I don't mean Bebe, but I mean quotethe Republicans etcetera, etcetera.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 1:55 TO 2:13 P.M.12Of course we've got, naturally, the uh,press. And you know I mean this God damnEllsberg film. I just don't know what thehell to do. That&#8482;s the problem.(Unintelligible)REEL END
