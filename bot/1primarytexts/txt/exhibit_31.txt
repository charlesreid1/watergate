TO 1:55 P.M.26EHRLICHMAN:...and if I can say go back and forth and onand so on, but (unintelligible) in thinkingabout this', I keep coming back to Dean because there are things that don't add up otherwise...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...in this whole thing. PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And, I don't know if you feel you can dothis, but I think the three of us know one another well enough, that, we've been through enough together, but(unintelligible) (tape noise) necessary thatwe have your very candid...PRESIDENT:Assessment? EHRLICHMAN:...assessment of the threat to you.Obviously, neither one of us want to doanything to harm you in any way, we want to avoid harming you.PRESIDENT:The threat (unintelligible) Dean?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. PRESIDENT:All right. EHRLICHMAN:Now, let me, let me just spin something outfor you. As a, as a...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...it has a probably a far out point, as wework back...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...I think it's entirely conceivable that ifDean is totally out of control and ifmatters are not handled (unintelligible),that you could get a resolution of impeachment...PRESIDENT:That's right.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.27EHRLICHMAN:...in the Senate...PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:...I don't know if you've thought of this ornot, but I got thinking about it last night. Uh, on the ground that you committed acrime.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Uh, and that there is no other legal processavailable to, uh, uh, the United Statespeople, other than...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...other than impeachment. Otherwise, youhave immunity from prosecution.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Uh, so I think we have to, I think we haveto think about that. We have to(unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...and see about, see what the point is, isit a crime, if any, and uh, how serious itis, and would Dean, is a threat, and what wedo about it. Uh, my own analysis is that what he has falls far short of anycommission of a crime by you. So far as Iknow.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:I don't know what you may have talked aboutwith him in those ten or twelve hours youand he spent there in the months, months of February and March.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, but, uh, you get down to a point whereyou've got John Dean prancing in there and saying, "The President said this and thePresident said that," and having somebody inyour behalf come back and say, "No, the President didn't say that, andAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.28EHRLICHMAN:that's ridiculous." Uh, and, and, so you geta kind of credibility thing unless, like heseems to be doing, he's very busy, uh,dredging up corroborating evidence and looking for documentation or taking statements frompeople based on leads that may have developedfrom those conversations. And I think really the only way that I know to make a judgement on this is for you to listen to your tapes andsee what actually was said then, or maybe forBob to do it, or, or, somebody. See what was said there. And then analyze how big a threatthat isPRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:If it didn't come out of those meetings, thenI think it's imaginary.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:Because it then does not come out of yourmouth, it comes by reason of the actions of, or something that one of us said or did, andit can be handled. But if you're reallyconfronted with that kind of a dilemna, or that kind of crisis in this thing, uh, I thinkbefore any other steps are taken, anyprecipitous steps (unintelligible) on us for that matter, uh, you better damn sure know...PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:...what your hole card is.PRESIDENT:I agree. EHRLICHMAN:Uh, beyond that, uh, hell, I'm, I'm not afraidof Dean, uh, and what he might say about mefor instance. Uh, I think it can be handled. Uh, I don't think Bob has anything to fear from Dean, basically, then, particularly basedon what the attorneys tell us, uh, he has analmost unlimited capacity to dredge up, uh, anecdotes, uh, from a from a dim and murkypast, and we're just gonna have, have tohandle it one by one. You mentioned the La Costa plan. Our fellowsAPRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.29EHRLICHMAN:probably didn't tell you this but DickMoore's attorney called on him, uh, on JohnWilson, and indicated that Dick Moore justdoesn't have any memory at all about La Costa. He can barely remember even beingout there.PRESIDENT:Dick, Dick Moore told me... EHRLICHMAN:I understand. PRESIDENT:...he said there was something...EHRLICHMAN:I understand.PRESIDENT:...maybe his memory's become dim. EHRLICHMAN:His memory is, apparently, feeble beyondmeasure, because his attorney has explainedto him what his exposure is...PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:...and Dick is scared shitless, apparently.Uh...PRESIDENT:To what point? HALDEMAN:...To the point where he has contactedSilbert to ascertain that he will not beindicted prior to his daughter's wedding, sothat he can go to his daughter's wedding.EHRLICHMAN:Now, that was his proposal to his attorneyto do that.PRESIDENT:Okay. HALDEMAN:He wanted his attorney to, to go and findout.PRESIDENT:Dick think he's going to be indicted forthat?UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:But not for, but not for, not for thatconversation alone...APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 11:06 A.M. TO 1:55 P.M.30EHRLICHMAN:Dick, Dick has been keeping (unintelligible)with Dean, all through this process. Andfar more than either of us, far more.PRESIDENT:Well, let me suggest this, Bob, uh, you'vegot the conversation (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Now, let me say...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...(unintelligible) I think I remember, Iwould remember everything, except, you see,there's always a possibility that Dean mayhave discussed this case with (unintelligible). I know the Bittman conversation, you know...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...I know however, that in thatconversation, the question was raised of blackmail-- I know, however, that in thatconver-, I also raised the question how muchis it going to, would it cost...HALDEMAN:Yeah. (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...a million dollars. And I saidfacetiously, "Well, I guess we can get a million dollars." It was then that we started my whole investigation. Now, Idon't know, how does that one sound to you?EHRLICHMAN:Well, that sounds tough and... PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...uh, yet it's manageable.(Unintelligible).************* PRESIDENT:Yeah. Point out that that was triggered.
