HALDEMAN, ANDJOHN EHRLICHMAN, THE EOB, ON APRIL 14, 1973,FROM 5:15 TO 6:45 P.M.TRANSCRIPT OF A RECORDING OF A MEETING AMONGTHE PRESIDENT, H.R. HALDEMAN, AND JOHN EHRLICHMAN, APRIL 14 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO6:45 P.M.(Tape noise occurs throughout)EHRLICHMAN:Well, he and his two lawyers who are ver-very bright young guys came in.--So I said,"Evidently, judging by your phone callearlier this is moot.&#64258; He said, "Yes, we have just come from our informal conference with the U.S. Attorney.&#64258; He proceeded thento voluntarily give me his whole testimonyfrom beginning to end.HALDEMAN:(unintelligible) sticky wickets, but no newones.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Your definition of their (unintelligible) HALDEMAN:On the other side (unintelligible) It's muchrougher on Dean.PRESIDENT:On Dean, he told him to lie? EHRLICHIIAN:No. He&#8482;s been a participant, an activeparticipant in this thing right from thevery beginning.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) talked about the case inthe most coherent way we've ever had.EHRLICHMAN:And I must say--HALDEMAN:We finally will know what happened. EHRLICHMAN:This has the--this has the ring of truthabout it. He, he is a convincing witness.So, ah, ah, you know. But at the same timeit has...APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.2HALDEMAN:It also is not in conflict with anythingelse you've gotEHRLICHMAN:That's true.HALDEMAN:...and almost totally corroborateseverything else you&#8482;ve got except you get toend of this time.EHRLICHMAN:This all starts back in September of 71,when Dean, Caulfield and Magruder,--ah, met and contrived an intelligence effort calledSandwedge. Too much, 2 months later, ah,Dean had been unable to find the right people to make that thing work.--and Deanhad approved of Liddy. And later ah, Dean,Liddy and Magruder met. Liddy, after-having some contact with Dean, and Magruder is a little vague on (unintelligible) forwardwith a million-dollar proposal. Magrudersays that Dean says that a million dollars was the right figure. And that&#8482;s why he picked that figure.--Budgets and so the fourof them met. They went over it and Mitchellrejected it. A week later, Liddy came back with a budget half as big, the half-milliondollar budget. And that was also rejected--PRESIDENT:By Mitchell? EHRLICHMAN:By Mitchell. Dean went on and said "Thesekinds of things shouldn't even be run byMitchell. He's Attorney General of theUnited States. He is sitting over herein his parochial office and he shouldn't even&#352;&#64257;APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.3EHRLICHMAN:Liddy and Magruder then went on to tryCONT.:and develop a satistactory project proposal.PRESIDENT:A quarterEHRLICHMAN:A quarter million dollar level. Magrudersaid he was never satisfied with it. Hekept sending Liddy back to the drawingboards. Finally, Colson called, with Liddy and Hunt in his office (unintelligible-tape noise) vigorously. Finally, although he,and he felt Mitchell, too, were nervousabout it and didn't feel comfortable about it, he said, "Well all right, I'll startthis moving."PRESIDENT:(Tape noise) he doesn&#8482;t say that Colsonchewed him out? Specifically about this proposal?EHRLICMAN:He said, Gordon Liddy's projects. He didnot say wire taps. He used the word "projects." In fact, there was indeed a budget for this quarter million dollarproposal. It was in writing. A copy of ithad been furnished to Gordon Strachan. And it was very specific, in terms of the kindof equipment to be used.PRESIDENT:It was furnished to Strachan? EHRLICHMAN:Yes sir. (Unintelligible) There was noproblem from Strachan. That is he informedStrachan that he was going to go ahead withthe so-called Liddy proposal and, I read his, I read his non-response as okay fromhigher-up. I am not able to say of my ownknowledge that there was anyAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.4EHRLICHMAN:Knowledge of anyone higher-up. Ah, in pointof fact, the, the ah, ah,-was insisting uponwas information on Larry O&#8482;Brien. That wasthe thing he called about and that's the thing that he had been driving at. Aroundthe end of March, Mardian, ah, ah, excuseme, Magruder and LaRue went to Key Biscayne where John Mitchell was.PRESIDENT:Magruder. LaRue?.EHRLICHMAN:Right. They presented it to Mitchell,Liddy's final proposal, which (unintelligible) installed bugs in threeplaces-&#338;Watergate--PRESIDENT:Was that on the phone? EHRLICHMAN:They were in person. PRESIDENT:MagruderMagruder and Mitchell--and LaRueand LaRue. Presented it to Mitchell?EHRLICHMAN:Yes sir. PRESIDENT:In three places, huh? EHRLICHMAN:It involved bugging three places -Watergate,McGovern Headquarters and the Fontainebleu.In the conversation, Mitchell orally approved it. Ah, now, it involved otherthings besides taps, and ah, he was notspecific. He said, "In all, in all honesty this was a kind of a non-decision. Nobody felt comfortable in this thing but we weresort of bull-dozed into it."(Unintelligible) Ah --PRESIDENT:By Colson?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.5EHRLICHMAN:That's the inference. (Unintelligible)Liddy's project. I said, "Well now, clearup for me just how well informed wasStrachan?&#64258; He said, "I informed him orally of it. He had the budget."EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) parts that started to comeout of that thing were junk. Ah, we got, we got synopses of the log. He said, "I got the only copy. I, Magruder, is got the onlycopy of the synopses.PRESIDENT:Mitchell got a copy. EHRLICHMAN:He thought they were a lot of junk too. Ah,(tape noise) named Gemstone. The one copythat Magruder had of the pictures of, of the kind of papers that you'd find around a campaign-(Unintelligible) synopses of thepictures of Mitchell. He thought it was sobad he picked up the phone and called Liddy and chewed him out. He called em "Shitty"--I told Strachan that the synopseswere here. Ah, he may have come over andread them, and as I pressed him on that he got less and less sure of that. He says, "Itold him they were there."HALDEMAN:Strachan now, Strachan says, "I stoppedreading the synopses, that they were -we had 'em"EHRLICHMAN:Now I've got to skip back a ways and thenI'll come back to the, to Mitchell.HALDEMAN:Be sure you make that point to Strachan.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.6EHRLICHMAN:I think March, about the time of the meetingdown in Key Biscayne, Liddy threatenedMagruder's life. He said he was transferredto the Stans' operation.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:LaRue approached Magruder and said, "We needthat operation. You ought to take him back because it's, it's dead water without him.&#64258; In fact, from the White House to theHeadquarters, he says he told the U.S.Attorney, convinced him that they needed the operation. Back to the quality of the work,they, what they were were getting was mostlythis fellow Oliver phoning his girl friends all over the country lining up assignations. And paying money and discussing their YoungLeaders' Conference. Liddy was badlyembarrassed by the, ah, chewing out he got. (unintelligible) again met in meeting with him. He said to John Mitchell, "Mr.Mitchell, I'll take care of it." That wasall that was said. So the next break-in was entirely on Liddy's own motion. But Magrudersays neither Mitchell nor Magruder knew thatanother break-in was contemplated. I said "What ah, (unintelligible) after the firing of Liddy.&#64258; Magruder was very nervous abouthim. He phoned John Dean and asked Dean totalk to Liddy and try and settle him down because he was acting erratic. Who in theWhite House is--involved in this wholething?-the names that-I have given you. Dick Howard, some of Colson's people, and a lot of the secretaries in the EOB,APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.7EHRLICHMANhave various information about a lot ofCONT.:different projects, and pickets--all kindsof things that will come pouring out in theprocess of this whole thing. Well I said, "Back to the burglary, who else?". He said,"No one else.&#64258; He said, "The U.S. Attorneyis hot after Colson:-they know he was close to Hunt. The only thinq they have him on right now is the phone call to Magruder ah,so far as Jeb knows. But his attorney thenchimed in, and said, "I think the U.S. Attorney has a good deal more because theU.S. Attorney told the lawyer that Hunt hadre-perjured himself with respect to Colson."-when he was called back in under immunity and testified as to the break-in,and the capture of the burglars, and thecover-up. Mitchell, LaRue, Mardian and the lawyers basically--plus Magruder. Ah, Dean devised a cover story, ah, in concert withthese other people, and enlisted, ah, BartPorter who went to the Grand Jury and perjured himself in concert with the coverstory. Dean prepared Magruder and othersfor the testimony at the Grand Jury, cross-examining and getting them ready. Likewise, he leaked out information from theGrand Jury to the people at the Committeefor the Re-election. The U.S. Attorney knows that he did that. It is illegal to do so.PRESIDENT:Did he say where he got it?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.8EHRLICHMAN:He got it from higher-up. Ah, I assumethat's Henry Petersen, but I don't know.Okay, with Magruder and Mitchell in theoperation of their, of this cover story about ah, these meetings. And they, theyworked out a, a, deal and they cancelled onemeeting -the million dollar meeting-and the second meeting which was the half-million dollar meeting -they told the Grand Jurythey...PRESIDENT:He's testified to all this? EHRLICHMAN:Yes. They talked about election laws.Yeah, he's just told the U.S. Attorney allthis. He--destroyed his diary, but he couldn't do that. Ah, there's a million and a half dollars in cash that was distributed.PRESIDENT:Jesus Christ!EHRLICHMAN:LaRue and Stans know about it. There isquote the famous list un-quote of where that money went. Ah, I don't know I am going tohave to check my notes with O'Brien.O'Brien may have told me about that. He may have given some idea of where that went.The three-fifty is a part of that. Mitchellsays to Magruder, "Don't talk."PRESIDENT:Discouraged him. What about Haldeman? EHRLICHMAN:Haldeman's very much a target of the U. S.Attorney. So far they, they, they indicatedthat they, he was implicated only by association with other people--meaningStrachanAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.9EHRLICHMAN:presumably.--The attorney gaveCONT.:me his private evaluation, that that was alittle puffing on the part of the U.S.Attorney. He did not think that they had anything. Reisner and Powell Moore-PowellMoore is somebody on Timmons' staff who wasat the Committee and who accompanied Liddy on what are called "The Saturday Events.&#64258; "The Saturday Events" are the events thattook place the day after the burglary.Liddy went out to find Kleindienst at Burning Tree and, ah, told him to leteverybody out of jail, on orders from JohnMitchell. And LaRue, of course, and Mardian, largely on obstruction. They're developing many counts of obstruction ofjustice. Ah, one of the attorneys then inwinding up, I told him-I gave Jeb your wishes and felicitations and so on and one of the attorneys said "Well, you know, inall of this there is not a scintilla ofevidence that the President was in any way aware of any of these transactions." And hesaid, "Well I didn't say that for anypurpose except just to express to you an impression I have about the way this thing's going." He said, "Literally tens of dozensof people down there crying to, to be heardby the U.S. Attorney. And he said, "This thing is rapidly deteriorating.&#64258; But, ah,he said, ah, "In all of this I don't see anyevidence of the involvement of the President." So that was that and I thanked them and sent them on their way. Now I havethe Attorney General of the United Statessitting at hone waiting to go to this dinner party and I have the DeputyAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.10EHRLICHMAN:Attorney General out of town. ButCONT.:as Bob points out, there isn't anything inmy report that isn't pretty well covered andexpanded on in what they've just got from Magruder. So, I think what. I can do iscall the Attorney General, tell him what Iwas going to tell &#8218;em, tell him that Magruder has just disclosed to me what he has shown to the U.S. Attorney and that Ireally don't have anything to add, but thatI did want him to be aware of the fact of the work that was done, and what I have donetoday. And, ah...HALDEMAN:Meetings which you had with Mitchell... EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...and Magruder,EHRLICHHAN: Yeah.HALDEMAN:The purpose of your meetings was to make thepoint to them that they should not go on-on the misguided assumption that that was forthe President...EHRLICHMAN:Right. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) This says that the meetingsat Key Biscayne (unintelligible) existedlong, after...PRESIDENT:Tell me this Bob, ah, what is, what aboutStrachan? Strachan says he did not knowabout this.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.11HALDEMAN:Can I give Strachan a report on this?PRESIDENT:Sure. Sure. What is your, what was yourview about Strachan's perjury?EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. (More than one voice heard,all unintelligible) Make the headlines.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) He goes to the Grand JuryMonday morning. That's why it's fair that he be given this information so he doesn't perjure himself.PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:I don't think he's testified on any of thisso I don't think he has any perjury problem.What he's got to do is build the defensethat, that ah...PRESIDENT:Meets these points. HALDEMAN:Meets these points and ahPRESIDENT:Could...HALDEMAN:And he could--he can keep himself as a, asan office boy, which is what he was. A conference boy. If he lied about a thing-hepersdaded Gordon to keep Liddy on, orsomething, or Jeb to keep Liddy on-ah, I would think he would argue back that-"Jebsaid to me, 'Now, what should we do?' and Isaid, "Jees, I think-we better keep him on--he's getting good stuff.&#64258; (Unintelligible)APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.12HALDEMAN:I think Gordon knows how to deal with(Cont'd)that if you give it to him. But I -See now,I went back to Gordon today on this point(unintelligible) and he said, "Absolutely, there was no other money." That on the22 the only deal was for a fella tohandle it according to what Howard told him&#352; that&#8482;s who they sent the money over to.PRESIDENT:For him (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Well, we got Magruder, now, in this pickle.He's still on the government payroll in the Commerce Department.PRESIDENT:In Commerce?EHRLICHMAN:I think it is.--I thought he was. HALDEMAN:As I listen to this the second time around.Let me tell you what my concerns are.(Unintelligible) When he got down to it, hetold the truth. And when he is talking to us, at least, he is bringing us into it. He will, for instance, he'll want to elaborateon uh, Sandwedge and say I was involved init. Wow, to the extent that I listened to a presentation, I was. But I, at the timesaid, "This is something I don't want to beinvolved in. Something that should not be handled in here. Don't, come to me any more with it", and they didn't. And then he'llsay I was also involved in the meetings.That he came to me after that second meeting and said, "They came up with, ah, you know,the plans,APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.13HALDEMANwith a preposterous plan." I told himCONT.:that, "It can't be done."They shouldn'teven be talking about it in the AttorneyGeneral's office. I said, "John, get out of it. You stay out of it, too." And he did.He said he would stay out of it from thenon, and I suspect he did. They'll tie me in that way by indirection in a sense that, but, the problem. is, that, I think--hispeople with him. May be that sounds like"everybody go down with the ship" but, ah, when it comes to this cover up businessExpanding-on, ah -Yes, he has a feeling--thethree fifty. I am not uncomfortable with that, but Dean, Dean is uncomfortable.PRESIDENT:What do you do about Dean? In other words,JohnHALDEMAN:The U.S. Attorney's got to (unintelligible) PRESIDENT:But Dean has been ah... EHRLICHMAN:I think this all has broken since. I thinkthey were probably playing it just right.PRESIDENT:Play their game (unintelligible) Magrudertestifies. (Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:I, I think that's their...PRESIDENT:Analysis. EHRLICHMAN:...analysis.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.14PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:I think they are after Colson, you,-me and(unintelligible) I say to the highest levelprovable objection.PRESIDENT:Let me say that this, this tends to ah, withthe Ervin Commititee over.hanging...--HALDEMAN:One, of these items each day, has come up. EHRLICMAN:Well, looking at the line, I should callKleindienst to be sure and catch him beforehe gets out.PRESIDENT:Why don't you call him? EHRLICHMAN:If I can find him.PRESIDENT:All right. That's the only thing I'mthinking about--is that, with the thing on...EHRLICHMAN:I see. If it turns out I call him(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I don't see how McCord can be put on nowwithout prejudicing the cases of the defendents.EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:I mean, I (unintelligible) try to call Ervinand tell him not to do it.HALDEMAN:Ah, Jeb's attorneys felt that they would doso, and they say that there are case that would require it.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.15PRESIDENT:Do you have negotiations with Ervin onMonday?HALDEMAN:I have.EHRLICHMAN:I really think Ervin would be delighted. Ifyou give him a chance to prove his casebetter, you will have more than you havehere.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:That gives him better keep an eye on him.He's going to think it solves all hisproblems. (Unintelligible) I'm not sure it does this (unintelligible). At least Ishould get her written stuff(unintelligible). ---------------------------------------(Ehrl (Ehrlichman begins conversation ontelephone)EHRLICHMAN:Hello, Hi, General. How are you?How was the golf? First half good?To keep you you up to date on what I've beendoing. Ah, for about the last three weeks--well, since I saw you, before I sawyou out in San Clemente--the President hashad me trying to gather together, as you know, a certain amount of law. Yesterday, I gave him my it was hearsay, some of itpretty, pretty reliable. And the wholething fit together pretty well as, I told him was that I had encountered people tocome forward becauseAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.16EHRLICHMAN: somehow felt that the Presidency, er, er,CONT;:was served by their not coming forward. Sohe has had me today, in a series ofconversations with people, to straighten them around on that point, and the first oneI talked to was your predecessor. Then Italked to Magruder, and-Ah, as, at it turned out, I was just alittle late in talking to Magruder, becausehe had just come back from tellingeverything to the U.S. Attorney. He has decided to come clean.Yep, and ah, and he had his informalconference just minutes before he came in to see me.(Unintelligible) inconsistent.And he, he implicates everybody in alldirections, up and down in the Committee to Re-elect.Yep, cold turkey&#352;-My instructions were, thatafter I had complete--well I, I might saythat I also talked to a couple of other people who are around here, ah, just to passthe, the word to encourage them, ah, totestify, if the only reason they were not testifying was some concern about the (unintelligible). Also, being very carefulto say that I recognized everybody hadrights, and that it didn't mean-now. Magruder then...Yep.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.17EHRLICHMAN:--More than just a participation in aCONT.:conspiracy, Dick.Ah, I must say that my conversation with himwas reassuring in that regard. He's very steadfast in his protestations of......the Magruder case is not onlytestamentary but it is circumstantial and is persuasive to me....I didn't have all of this here I am a, acitizen of the United States and a, thedesignated inquirer with a body of information. Ah, my purpose and intent wasto advise you of this when I had finishedwith this process and tender this information for whatever purpose it would serve, recognizing that until just a fewminutes ago it was almost entirely hearsay.Magruder has just unloaded on me the substance of his conversation with the U.S. Attorney-informal conversation. And I findthat I now have very little to add to whatMagruder has already given the U.S. Attorney.I felt that I should go forward and at leastadvise you of this and to-ah(Unintelligible, loud noises) let me spoilyour afternoon completely, will you? ONe ofthe things Magruder told me was ah, and, ah,and his attorney who was with him corroborated, was that they are veryAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.18EHRLICHMAN:concerned about Dean's ah, facility forCONT.:advising people at the Committee of theproceedings of the Grand Jury.Well, he was apparently informing Magruderand others of what the Grand Jury was sayingand doing. Silbert or someone else said toDean's Attorney, "Well, we know the source of Dean's information and it was from higher up."In any event, ah, I remember what you toldme before (noise) and I originally had thought that perhaps something would beserved by you and Sneed coming in and thethree of us but this thing has taken the Magruder bounce,-to think now that you better, to tell Sneed the substance of thisconversation.--well, don't you think? Yep. I think the President's feeling is thatSneed could do that.Well, I, I think he is pretty firm on that.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.19EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think you should on Monday.CONT.:Alright.--thought and we will too, and then we should talk on Monday.--along to me.I just, just wanted you to have a nice timethis evening.Dont&#8482;t forget my tender if there's any waythat any of this hearsay of mine that ah,that I have collected is in, in anyway useful, I would be glad to make it available. But I, I, my thinking is that Icould add very little to what Magruder just told me.(Unintelliglble) my dear.Your&#8482;re, my favorite law enforcementofficer.Do you want ah, do you want me to give you anything additional on Monday?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.20EHRLICHMAN:Well no I have been talking to people'CONT.:for three weeks. I have talked to everybodybut the milkman.--outside, and people's lawyers, and everydamn thing.Well, I've talked to them and in some casesthey know I&#8482;ve talked to other people.They had to know that because, you know,they knew the source of my leads,Ah, no. He's largely implicated onobstruction of justice.Yeah.--was having a terrible time living with it,and he didn't see any point in waiting any longer. His attorneys said they analyzed it very carefully, and they could see, ah, noAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.21EHRLICHMAN:--advantage to waiting, and everyCONT.:advantage to getting in now.--couple of very bright guys,. I, I've gottheir names over there, but I can't tell you now. Bernbaum and somebody else. Sears, Ithink is the other guy. (unintelligible).Pardon? Sure. Sure.Alright, let me know.I am going to go see Bernstein and what'shis name get their awards.(End of telephone conversation)EHRLICHMAN:He is shook (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:--both his eyes were closed.(Two people heard talking, butunintelligible)HALDEMAN:Think this was surprise to him? EHRLICHMAN:A subject of great distress to him, I&#8482;lltell you that.PRESIDENT:Of course he was distressed. Let me askyou, John, about Colson. Ah, everything that has been said here, despite the factthat they were not after him-it would beconsistent with Colson's not, ah, knowing the Watergate business.EHRLICHMAN:Magruder doesn't lay a glove on him.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.22PRESIDENT:But he said they're hot after him. But wherethey may have the "hot after him" is on the,ah, what?EHRLICHMAN:on is connection with Hunt. Their premiseapparently is, according to their lawyers,that everything Hunt knew, Colson knew.PRESIDENT:But Hunt ah, then Hunt therefore will ah,they're going to try to get him to come in and let, and let, uh, lay a glove on Colsonnow.HALDEMAN:Colson (unintelligible) It will be Colson'srole to get himself a defense.(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Well, Kleindienst says, for reasons I haveto be very careful about who I communicate with, for the next little while.PRESIDENT:Okay.EHRLICHMAN:He wants me to meet with him and HenryPetersen tomorrow. I, I&#8482;m possessed of information establishing the committing of acrime. And, uh, I've got to be darn carefulabout who I talk to.PRESIDENT:On, ah, on things that you have done (laugh)PRESIDENT:Ah,APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.23EHRLICHMAN:He says that Sneed detached fromWatergate-was in a perfect position to acton it, but, he wishes we'd get a specialprosecutor.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:He wants to talk about it Monday, and ahPRESIDENT:Do you still think that's a bad idea? EHRLICHMAN:I think it's very bad. All thesepeople-prosecutor.PRESIDENT:I want you to say that to him tomorrow.EHRLICHMAN:I sure will. PRESIDENT:That "I have just decided against it."EHRLICHMAN:Well, if you could hear me...(More than one person talks, unintelligible)PRESIDENT:This is outrageous...He's considered it.Thought it through. He doesn't want aspecial prosecutor because then it's areflection on the people you've got there. They're doing a hell of a job here. As the cases will point out. And we shouldn'tthrow them out, then, throw them out now.Let them continue...&#64258;HALDEMAN:Correct?PRESIDENT:Yeah. I agree.EHRLICHMAN:Interesting, the interesting fact--the U.S.Attorney for the District of Columbia has just had Magruder in the office and can sewup the case.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.24PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) Attorney General(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Yeah. PRESIDENT:If he doesn't resign?EHRLICHMAN:Well I don't think...HALDEMAN:I don't think he has to. EHRLICHMAN:I don't think he has to, though. I think hemay want to, and if he does want to, I thinkhe should.PRESIDENT:And if he doesn't want to we could put Sneedin the job?EHRLICHMAN:As acting until you get somebody damn good.PRESIDENT:You wouldn't keep Sneed...EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible/REMOVED) he's-ah,(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:You'd rather have our friend over at HUD?HALDEMAN:Somebody like him, yeah. yeah. PRESIDENT:Well, we need somebody that's damn good. EHRLICHMAN:You should have a spokesman.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.25PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Ehrlichman to get out thefacts that he has made this investigation, that we weren't drug kicking and screaminginto this thing. I don't know.EHRLICHMAN:--legal problem. I'll talk to Dicktomorrow.PRESIDENT:Yeah, it may be a legal problem.EHRLICHMAN:And if a, if there's not a legalproblem,--be a question, an, Monday for Ziegler on what Mitchell was doing at theWhite House. (unintelligible) He should sayhe was here talking to me."PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) "The whole matter(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:And he'll say, "Oh that's been given to theproper authorities.&#64258; That's what I would say.HALDEMAN:All he has to say is, why can you justsay...EHRLICHMAN:In due course.HALDEMAN:Unless you want that authority to say you'vebeen investigating.PRESIDENT:That's the whole-point.

First, thehearings when they eventually come are gonna be anti-climatic in my opinion. Ah,EHRLICHMAN:Could be anti-climatic. The networks mightjust, ah, not want &#8218;em.PRESIDENT:Because of the fact that the big fish havebeen indicted.HALDEMAN:Can't tell.PRESIDENT:And so forth. EHRLICHMAN:Or you may have Weicker saying "the wrongguys got indicted again" (unintelligible)that way. And you could say that...PRESIDENT:I think I've reached the conclusion, but thetwo of you and Ziegler will disagree withthat conclusion, but it's a loser for us tocontinue trying to say that, ah, I think you've got to say, that I agree on their bill of law, now, what do you think Bob?Let's be forthcoming on that -and get thatout fairly soon. (Unintelligible) I'm trying to get some appearance of, ofcooperation. (Unintelligible) Do you agree,Bob, or not?HALDEMAN:I do, I... PRESIDENT:Now the question is what do you do aboutDean. That may be moot. For that reason Iwould say--APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.27HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) guess that Mr. Dean's goingto be indicted.EHRLICHMAN:Magruder does not think Dean with thebreak-in and the bugging.PRESIDENT:No, but he says he was there...EHRLICHMAN:He's in the inception,PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:But they have... HALDEMAN:But he's in the inception only up to the(unintelligible) (Two people talking,unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Up to a point,...up to a point.

EHRLICHMAN:They obviously were interested in giving youall the information (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:I doubt it. He's completely relaxed. Asmile on his face. He wasn't shaking. He wasn&#8482;t going to fight it the way he's beenevery time I've seen him. He just said "Ihope this isn't going to be for too long."APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M.

And Liddy says, "Boy,that's crazy, look here, I saw him on thisday, and this day, and this day...&#64258;PRESIDENT:How about Dean? Of course that's the bigquestion. And what about the Haldemanstatement: should it be made now?EHRLICHMAN:Can't hurt anything... PRESIDENT:Hmm?EHRLICHMAN:Can't hurt anything.HALDEMAN:Clearly, it would have, it would have to bebroader, on Strachan-PRESIDENT:The point that I an, wondering, you see, Idon't know what we could say about (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Say that Strachan did get the thing.EHRLICHMAN:No.PRESIDENT:Did participate?

And then this hits.

Wedecide that (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Assert it,...don't answerPRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Let the judge decide that.

But yousee, you, you, get in a position where you can, uh, can say, they claim executivebecause of the (unintelligible) nature ofthe situation (unintelligible) of making the substance part public.EHRLICHMAN:I must say that I think part of the troublewith our agreement...PRESIDENT:Yes. HALDEMAN:John Dean may be into this where they can'tcall him anyway.PRESIDENT:That's what I'm thinking about, that. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.(more than one person talks, allunintelligible)PRESIDENT:You see I'm ah, I'm just thinkingAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.34PRESIDENT:about this one. Which appeared to beCONT.:forthcoming and, and, I wouldn't, I wouldn'tlet the Dean thing be a, be a big fracas, ifnecessary. I just think that that's one moveyou can make now at the present time. I, ah,just go and I, I think the proponent of the idea that will buy, buy a good headline for aday and invite Dean back for, for later on.But ah, we're going to get beat around thehead and shoulders.--Let's, let's ,let's faceit. We're going to get it until the GrandJury indicts, and then 'til the Grand Jury(unintelligible) that would be maybe another, ah, two, three weeks. After that, when they doindict, then they'll say "Christ, Mr.President, what the hell are you going to doto that, we'll beat &#8218;em to the punch. I thinkwe've got to do that. I just feel it's one ofthose things. (Unintelligible) to announcethat I make it tomorrow night. Would you dothat?HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) to be repudiated by thecommittee, that meets Tuesday.(Unintelligible) to, to wait...Phone rings:PRESIDENT:Ya, Ya. (Unintelligible). Very nice, surewould.

Well, we're supposedto be there at eight forty five.(Unintelligible) at eight forty five, OK.Well we'll have a wonderful tine and I'll seeyou there. See you when you get back. Bye.(Someone speaks, voice unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Maybe we should. (Unintelligible) I think, Ithink we've got to get bouncing. Ah, that,there, there's another thing I'm thinking of, Bob, is that there's...I'm thinking of thefact that this (noise) here now, may make thehearings a hell of a lot less interesting andalso a hell of alot...they sure as hellAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.35HALDEMAN:--my wife about that.PRESIDENT:Sure.HALDEMAN:I hate to see that stuff keep gettingobstructed by Watergate. That isn't the problem we're dealing with today. All thisstuff's developing on Watergate. This makesWatergate look a lot worse than it really used to look in a way.PRESIDENT:This does?HALDEMAN:Oh, I'll say it does because it involves somany people. (Unintelligible) and we got-a way (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:That's our problem.HALDEMAN:Well it be two weeks before this gets out?Is that...they were saying before that it was going to be May 15th, but now withMagruder's now on the applesauce. Huh? Whatcan they (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well... HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) they want to wind up allthe others; if they want to get all the obstructions, they've got to hear all thesepeople.HALDEMAN:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Not, not all of them, but they've got a,they got (unintelligible)APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.36Get a leg up. (unintelligible) will give&#8218;em a leg up, this Hunt thing give &#8218;em a legup,...(Several people talk, all unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:They make their case from the time that theyeither vote on indictments (unintelligible).They may recess the Grand Jury for a couple of weeks. (Unintelligible) indictments.HALDEMAN:Where else.PRESIDENT:Where else do you have a, ah...a what's thelatest we've got on the problem that's my point again (unintelligible). Say you'renot going to do it because of Dean.HALDEMAN:If the situation's going to get worse, thenyou maybe have to do something. If this is as bad as it's going to get, then, if thisgoing to change in a different direction,maybe you're better off not doing anything. Of course, the alternatives are, it's more likely to get worse. In other words(unintelligible), if you, if you thinkyou're ready to swing, my guess is probably there is an actual danger, that theRepublican House will meet and pass aresolution calling on the President...PRESIDENT:That's what I think HALDEMAN:...and probably a unanimous resolution.PRESIDENT:I think it's very close to that right now.I think this would trigger it, without question. They would be so horrified aboutthat the White House staff (Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Could be. But I guess that's not going tosatisfy them. But, this pretty much establishes the Watergate thing and then yousay (unintelligible) like Goldwater,APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.37HALDEMAN:the people that want this done with aregoing to---You've got to look at the otherpossible boxes to say, "Well, thank God,it's been, all been cleared up now. Let's forget all this other shit" and, a, somewill say, "It's now clear the White Housewasn't involved, and thank God they weren't. And it's clear the President wasn't involved and thank God he wasn't. It's a tragedy thatthey great man, John Mitchell, was.&#64258; Ah...PRESIDENT:And that so many people at the Committeewere.HALDEMAN:And then, everybody will dwell on that.PRESIDENT:Except that, except that except that you'vegot a fair chance that Dean will get it. A fair chance that someone will break.(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:I would spotlight it as the, as theumbilical cord at the White House and in the Committee and the question will be, "What&#8482;sat the other end of those umbilical cords?"PRESIDENT:Then, you-don't think HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:You don't think there's much, ah...HALDEMAN:The unbelievableness... PRESIDENT:Dean, no, Dean's high enough. HALDEMAN:The ah, now, the unbelievableness of it.isbeing answered by this. "There is somebodyhigher than Gordon Liddy had to have agreed to spendAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.38HALDEMAN:a quarter of a million dollars...CONT.:PRESIDENT:That's the pointHALDEMAN:...the Democratic National Committee." Nowyou've got that somebody.PRESIDENT:That's Mitchell.HALDEMAN:Now that you've got somebody who was, you'vegot a believable case where you can now say, "Well, so there was some other stuff goingon but, ah, this was where the problem was."PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I'd just like to get Segretti out in our, inour forum. Don't you think so?HALDEMAN:Yes, you've got to get it out.(Unintelligible) Watergate (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Haldeman. They'll say, they'll say Haldeman(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...and let's see what they say. PRESIDENT:Huh?HALDEMAN:If it says Haldeman admits guilt, I meanthat's pretty clear.PRESIDENT:I know.HALDEMAN:What I want to do...PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.39HALDEMAN:But, ah, the Ziegler or Kissinger view isvery strongly that that's what I shouldn'tdo. I'm the last guy to decidePRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...which is right.PRESIDENT:Yeah. What do you think, John?HALDEMAN:John thinks I should. EHRLICHMAN:I think he should come out. PRESIDENT:It will come out right after that. Severalof the Republicans...EHRLICHMAN:Now as I say, I haven't, I haven't heardHenry's...PRESIDENT:You start with Weicker and other Republicansand right after that and say, "Haldeman should resign because of his involvement in the Segretti matter."HALDEMAN:Either (unintelligible) you'd have to resignPRESIDENT:Or I defend it. HALDEMAN:Or you defend it. You can't, I don't thinkyou can ignore it. If, ah, if I've donethat you've either got to, you've got tothen make the judgement that that was sufficient to cause me to resign or itwasn't. That's the first question of thefirst person. (Unintelligible) it should be answered before...(Several people talk, all unintelligible)APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.40PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) that Haldeman's gonnaresign, you mean?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Ziegler can, the next day, say "Hisconnection to this was very remote, was very benign.&#64258; And he...get thatout...(unintelligible) in my view, before itwas established that a crime was committed by Segretti.PRESIDENT:Right.(Several people talk, all unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I would not, I would not be, I would not beas, not be as strong for your getting itout, except for his having said "selfincrimination", the fact that that made him...HALDEMAN:You've got a really- crunchy decision, whichis whether you, whether you want me toresign or whether you don't. You, that's one you've got to figure out. The problem with that is if I go on the basis of the Segrettimatter, you've got to let Dean go on thebasis of his implication, which is far worse.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Strachan's already out of the White House sothat's no problem. If they wait awhile (unintelligible) Ehrlichman in, you aregoing to have to let him go.EHRLICHMAN:He's got, he's got sort of a, got sort of ahypothesis that he's developing in ourconversation that,APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.41EHRLICHMAN:that referring him to Kalmbach was almost asCONT.:good as action (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:As a matter of fact, I didn't refer him toKalmbach. He came to me and said, "May I goto Kalmbach?".HALDEMAN:He did the same thing to me. PRESIDENT:Go to Kalmbach for the purpose of? EHRLICHMAN:For the purpose of getting Herb to raisesome money. For the purpose of paying thedefendants. For the purpose of keeping them, quote, on the reservation, unquote.PRESIDENT:Right. With that they could try to tie youand Bob in a conspiracy to obstruct justice.EHRLICHMAN:That's his theory. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) questionable.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'm not so sure that makes anydifference at this int. He's coloring this in order to induce (unintelligible) the key was in their (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well, lesser (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Strachan's position is totally tenable andtrue (unintelligible)--without givinghim any help.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.42(Beginning of Reel Two)PRESIDENT:I know. The way you have to handle that, let'sface it, is that, uh, I mean, is there, of course, you've got the whole business of the aftermath, as to(End of Reel One)uh, as to motive. And, uh, there, if you or Bobare asked, uh, what do you say?EHRLICHMAN:Well, a, as far as I can reconstruct it and Imay be putting it favorably, (unintelligible-tape noise) clearly-is concerned about what these fellows are going to testifyto. The Grand Jury in secret couldn't hurt,whether they would go out and sell their stories, uh, to Saturday Evening Post...HALDEMAN:Life Magazine. PRESIDENT:Sure, sure. EHRLICHMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:That's right. They're not a bit concerned about(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:So, uh, I, I, was concerned about that,particularly Hunt who is a kind of aro- an author type and, and would be inclined to do that kind of thing.HALDEMAN:In fact I had no knowledge who was or wasn'tguilty or where the thing led.PRESIDENT:I see. I see. HALDEMAN:That's exactly right. We weren't protectinganybody.EHRLICHMAN:I'm even willing to buy that. HALDEMAN:I know, I said that to John, and John didn'tagree with me.PRESIDENT:I wish we could keep Dean away from that.Magruder we don't have to get that in, uh, (unintelligible) unless it's a-Let me say, uh, let's, let's, let's, let's sleep on what we do with the uh My, my view is, though, I thinkthat, I think the odds are, that the interest inthe Committee is less. (Unintelligible) some of the big fish. The second thing is going to be, uh -APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.43HALDEMAN:A lot of people are going to say, "ForChrist sake, you solved the Watergate now,forget it.&#64258; Will that come to this?PRESIDENT:Some of our people can see it. Christ,that's not what he wanted investigated.HALDEMAN:He said that the folks out there got fed upwith it anyway. Just say, just get an answer and get it out of the way. That's what I'm talking about. They don't care.PRESIDENT:It's really such a crappy thing. And he'llcome in, plead self-incrimination, and clear him.EHRLICHMAN:Be a lively copy when they start bringing inall these people from around the country. What they did or who were victims, or witnesses, or something.PRESIDENT:It'd be lively copy, John, but it's sortsstuffy.EHRLICHHAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:It, it's not the good stuff.(Unintelligible)(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Horrible, horrible. But we got eight monthsto go. Well, let me finish my analysis.(Unintelligible). The, uh in my opinion, Bob, for the forthcoming thing which I think, I tilted against I think Magruder(unintelligible) is for (unintelligible) asmany as we need, any move right now.HALDEMAN:I think you've got it if you're going to doit, though, I think you've got to face thelikelihood that Magruder or somebody is going to call for my resignation for having hired Segretti.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:I did hire Segretti. (Unintelligible)APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.44PRESIDENT:It's Strachan.HALDEMAN:Yeah. (Unintelligible) over a period oftime will come back with these This isthe-first time? You've got a couple of others who should have been said, uh -PRESIDENT:We've gotta face that.HALDEMAN:You might want to, want to tie it to aresignation at the time I do it. On the basis that, that, ah &#64257;Well, here is amistake, and I have no problem with it. ButI'm also not going to be in enough trouble in all this stuff now without, without my(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) ought to resign sometime,don't.HALDEMAN:I'm not suggesting I'm not suggesting I'dlike to resign.PRESIDENT:Don't. HALDEMAN:To tell you very frankly, I would not liketoPRESIDENT:Uh.HALDEMAN:At this time I&#8482;d be willing to, withoutcreating any sticky problems.PRESIDENT:That's the duty of our, uh, all our It's theduty of our whole, duty of our whole staff, and uh, though, they would play, play, play their role (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:I'm free from some other things and I cancut loose, which I do. The problem we get there on the other side is that there's somepluses to it. What about that?PRESIDENT:With an Attorney General added in. And aWhite House Counsel, possibly. White House counsel.HALDEMAN:Pretty big bag, John.EHRLICHMAN:The biggest.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.45PRESIDENT:The least; that's the point.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Historically, people think in perspective,but it, uh, take some time.HALDEMAN:Historically you expect to (unintelligible)that. (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I see. HALDEMAN:Well, fire some people, because you cannotPRESIDENT:I have given them leave. Uh, if they shouldnot fall under indictment (unintelligible),may be they can continue their duties.HALDEMAN:If they intend to plead innocent.(Unintelligible several talking)HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) in the United States look,that's about it, are you gonna pleadinnocent or guilty? And if you're going toplead guilty innocent fine, you are suspended, I'll tell you when you can concentrate on the (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Set out the Ervin negotiations and how weget out the, uh, investigation and, uh, all this.PRESIDENT:Well, this (unintelligible), I want to keepErvin at the (unintelligible), but I kind of feel myself that (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:I do too.PRESIDENT:We ought to say, uh, and I think, uhEHRLICHHAN:With that being the case, and the DeanmaterialAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.46PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Now wait a minute, there'sno need to grapple with it.HALDEMAN:If he breaks off, you could make a bargainwith the CommitteePRESIDENT:I think -EHRLICHMAN:My exponent-PRESIDENT:Yes, and what would you say? You could say,"The President is directing this he's not in (unintelligible).&#64258; They will appear(unintelligible). I don't think that'sneeded tomorrow. I think, I think, I think you ought to meet with Ervin and cut thedeal and then, then even though it isn'tmuch of a compromise, you could say, "We have work, worked out a compromise under which there is an open session. They won'tget, you 'on Dean, Dean goes free. Dean inExecutive session is the, it's very nice (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:How's that sound to you, Bob.(Unintelligible) get a story out which will, uh, keep the animals a little cool forawhile.

You're going to have the next day to build it up a little.HALDEMAN:No, you don't want to build it up.PRESIDENT:Put it right out. The problem here, let mesay, in your case, is not Segretti. (Unintelligible) with Segretti stuff andthen, the in your case is Strachan. I meanthe (unintelligible) purpose of keeping the (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Oh, yes, uh, uh, (unintelligible) I knowthat, testify on that.EHRLICHHAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Would you carry that secret?EHRLICHMAN:The question is whether Strachan is indictedor not.PRESIDENT:If he is indicted?HALDEMAN:I think I've got to cover myself on theStrachan thing, as you said, in such a way so that if anything does happen it's, it's covered and you can go back to my statementand say I said that he was the guy tocontact, that, that he should not be built up as a central figure, nor should I try toexplain his every action. As I can't. Someof his actions were obviously carried out unilaterally.EHRLICHMAN:I think that's overly objective.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 5:15 P.M. TO 6:45 P.M.48PRESIDENT:I think some of Magruder's stuff could be(unintelligible) pretty, pretty lively. Ithink it's probably basically true.(Unintelligible) you remember back that far? Think of that for a few days,(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:You can't be that precise - PRESIDENT:You can't be that precise: You rememberwhat (unintelligible) were in You rememberthe things that you want to remember, prettymuch.HALDEMAN:Well, especially when you've lived through awhole series of varying very heated -PRESIDENT:Magruder's? HALDEMAN:Which he has. PRESIDENT:Magruder's, Magruder's--You've got toremember now, Magruder is going to be as, asuh, potent a witness, and again as (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Strachan (unintelligible) a strong witnesstoo, an, and they&#8482;re going to, they, theyare going (unintelligible) do something.PRESIDENT:And they will--They have to say, "Who'slying?&#64258; "Who's going to lie? I mean, here'sa guy who has a record of lying. He lied (unintelligible). Are you going to take his word against Strachan who did not lie andcame back to the U.S. Attorney?"HALDEMAN:We can produce people around here who cangive you give different stories thatMagruder's told you, but which one is true?PRESIDENT:What do you think Mr. Colson is going to bedoing-to us?
