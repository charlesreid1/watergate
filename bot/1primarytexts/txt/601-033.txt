PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:and, uh, (unintelligible with noise)necessary?PRESIDENT:So? EHRLICHMAN:I, I can see, I can see all kinds ofnegativesd in it...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...in terms of people saying, you know,here's the economy.PRESIDENT:Another thing, too, that I've been thinkingabout. I've been very interested to note that your, uh, your, your fellows in theiranalysis of the polls showed the rathermodest support that we're gettingEHLICHMAN:...That's right, that's right.PRESIDENT:In other words, uh~ it was less than I hadpredicted2 (unintelligible). I, it might be, it mightbe advantageous I guess.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I can see, for example, why we had to doentire (unintelligible) It was basically an issue that could have been a hell of anissue, otherwise.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah. PRESIDENT:Revenue sharing, I think was just somethingwe just did...EHRLICHMAN:DefensivePRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:Defense --PRESIDENT:Just to be doing something, to be tryingEHRLICHMAN:Well, it's, it's our answer to the problemsof the cities, the farmsPRESIDENT:Problems of the (unintelligible) and allthat, as far as the average guy isconcerned, it didn't make much, uh, it didn't make as much headway. I wonder this year if, ah, we really want to go on a new,a great new initiative, I wonder, I wonder,I --EHRLICHMAN:Well --PRESIDENT:I...you see, the point that I, uh, raise andincidentally, this is related also to our problem on Hoover. I read his, I mean your memorandum. That's a very good fellow, isit Liddy?EHRLICHMAN:Liddy. PRESIDENT:Smart, isn't he?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, very.PRESIDENT:Must be conservative as hell EHRLICHMAN:Conservative? PRESIDENT:Smart. How'd he get, why'd get in theBureau?3EHRLICHMAN:Uh, he was Hoover's ghost writer. Uh, did alot of Hoover's speeches. (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:And Hoover fired him?EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, no, no he got disillusioned. And,uh, he, he put in for a transfer and we found him over in, uh--PRESIDENT:Let me tell you what I have a feeling on it.It's a way out thing. His, his analysis of Hoover from a psychological standpoint is tremendously perceptive. We may have on ourhands here a man who will pull down thetemple with him, including me. I don't think he would want to, I mean he considershimself a patriot, but he now sees himselfas McCarthy did, Benson did, and perhaps Agnew does...EHRLICHMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:...now...EHRLICHMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:as, he sees himself as an issue rather thanthe issue which is the great...EHRLICHMAN:Well --PRESIDENT:...weakness of any political man. EHRLICHMAN:Ordinarily I would not....PRESIDENT:Hickel did.EHRLICHMAN:o..ordinarily I would not have sent you thewhole piece, ..PRESIDENT:I heard the whole thingEHRLICHMAN:...but I wanted you to let that buildup thatthis guy gave you.PRESIDENT:That piece would make a brilliant, brilliantpiece for a magazine, nanyway. He makes-actually, and this is -gets down to your other point, interestingly enough, a stronger case for not doing something onHoover than doing something.4EHRLICHMAN:Hummmm, mmmPRESIDENT:Now, there's something in between [noise]EHRLICHMAN:There must bePRESIDENT:You see, first of all, the, after, let'ssuppose we, we, we get Hoover in and Iconvince him we can't, or, you know, order, noway I'm gonna say I didn't (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Now, just let me run this by you, justoccurred to me right now, the helicopter thedevious way to get at a very entire difficultproblem. We do that, then Hoover through allof his operatives, will piss on anybody thatwe send up there who other name. And I don'tthink he will approve any other name. That's my guess. You have the feeling maybe that hemight approve Pat Grays is that correct?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I, uh, I think Pat has a better chancethan most.PRESIDENT:Yeah, But look, so you, so I send Pat Gray'sname up, then you come to something else.You're gonna come into one of the hellest,damnedest Senate Confirmation fights you eversaw, who is Pat Gray? How is he qualified?RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;a stooge, a Nixon stooge,now I agree he isn't, you should have have aproper Bureau, if you have somebody from theBureau, they'll say you should have somebodyfrom outside. And then, uh, Ramsey Clark willbe recommended.EHRLICHMAN:[laughs] PRESIDENT:No, I'm serious.EHRLICHMAN:I know, I know.PRESIDENT:Now, there's a way to get around it. That wedefuse the whole god-damned thing. Hoovermade a very interesting point, he said,regardless of who wins in '72, he says, I'llprobably be out. And5of course he's right. Why doesn't he announcenow that I am, this is my last year in theBureau, I am submitting my resignationeffective on January lst, 1972...EHRLICHMAN:Hmmm mmmPRESIDENT:...so that the new President, I mean, thePresident who's elected, so that I will rat be an issue in the campaign. The President willselect him, they select anybody that he wants.Now, let's look at that for a moment. Theweakness in it is that we've still got a, aninefficient FBI to screw around with for ayear. I'm not sure we can do a hell about, ahell of a lot about the efficiency of the FBI in a year anyway. Uh, the, uh, the otherweakness is that presumably Hoover's enemieswould be so furious at having the issueremoved they would continue on it. But it&#8482;spretty hard to take on a man when he says"Now, I've, go think I've had it. I've donemy job and at the end of this, I, I might givethe new President, whoever he is, whether it'sPresident Nixon or it's, uh, the other President, I want them to know that this, thisis that I&#8482;m going to take the Bureau out ofpolitics.EHRLICHMAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:Now from Hoover's standpoint, he just, he hasto realize that he can't stay forever. He hasto realize that, that the new President, that at, uh, 78 years of age -is that what he wouldbe then?UNIDENTIFIED:He's 77 now.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know, I forget.PRESIDENT:Anyway, uh, then, the, the advantage of thatis that, uh, well, what I'm more concernedabout than anything else that I, I don't thinkwe talked through adequately (unintelligible)of getting Hoover out. It's going to be a problem. I should think the confirmationproject would be one that would make theSupreme Court look like, uh, you know--6EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Whatcha doin&#8482; about civil rights?EHRLICHMAN:Wiretapping andPRESIDENT:What do ya ask about wiretapping.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:What is the, ah on Hoover--look up Hoover'sname and age.UNKNOWN:Hoover&#8482;s age?PRESIDENT:Don't call the FBI to find out, just, justlook it up. I think it's 76 or. 7, I wouldwant to know month of birthday. Ah, now, you,let's let's look at that in terms of, uh,EHRLICHMAN:One thing that'll happen--PRESIDENT:No, I don't know, I don't know, maybe it won'twork, but I, I guess, I guess, I, that, Ithink that we could get Hoover, I think Icould get Hoover to resign if I put it to himdirectly that without it he's going to be hurtpolitically which I happen to believe if youdo it otherwise. But I think if he resigns,and I think, he's going to, I don't think he'sgoing to like it, I don't think I I think thatyour confirmation is going to be one hell of a job. And you want to remember whoever weappoint, uh, is appointed at the will of thePresident anyway. (unintelligible) They can(unintelligible) if we lost the election,EHRLICHMAN:Sure. You take the position that you'll pickhis successor if you're elected.PRESIDENT:Yes. EHRLICHMAN:In other words, there'd be no, uh, campaignissue there.PRESIDENT:Right, that's right. I'm not willing tosuggest it now, whole it gonna be. I'll stateonly that it's not gonna be Ramsay Clark.(unintelligible) Tough. You know, just saythat's an issue, that the FBI should not.bean-issue in the.campaign, we'll pick the verybeat possible man we can get at that time. And that's it.7EHRLICHMAN:Uh, huh. Uhl huh.PRESIDENT:In a few.-- EHRLICHMAN:Then he becomes a lame duck director.PRESIDENT:Correct. So? How much are you going to dowith the FBI anyway in a year?EHRLICHMAN:We can'tPRESIDENT:You can't do it. It's a hell of a job. Ican see it as a --shake up. If he becomes a lame duck director. But also he might become a lame duck director. Everybody,maybe, trying to let the old guy go outwithout pissing on him....EHRLICHMAN:YeahPRESIDENT:...and say, look here, let's...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:and he tries to keep, he becomes a littlewild-eyed, maybe, just trying to, you know-What kind of a, incidentally, what kind ofa man is Sullivan, incidentally? I, I don't know him.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I don't know him at all, they tell mehe is...PRESIDENT:I thought you did know him. EHRLICHMAN:No, I never, I, I don't think I&#8482;ve ever methim or if I have I only met him on veryshort acquaintance.PRESIDENT:He seems tome, from the description, he'shonest and capable.EHRLICHMAN:--thoughtful. Ube he's astute, uh, uh, avery sensitive guy, uh, apparently very well-spoken and has, uh, very strong, uh,loyalties running down into the personnel ofthe Bureau. And, uh, uh, the at one time had an enormous amount of power over there, delegated by Hoover.8PRESIDENT:Oh, didn't Sullivan do sane of theintelligence Work for HooverEHRLICHMAN:Oh. yes.PRESIDENT:And us.EHRLICHMAN:Sure UNIDENTIFIED:That's right sir. He will be 77 nextbirthday, which is January 1st.PRESIDENT:Fine. Now, you W, there it is. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah PRESIDENT:No, no man in his right mind can say at 78the President of the United States ought tobe appointing him as director of the FBI. He's too old.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Uh, Sullivan was the man who executedall of your instructions for the secret taps.PRESIDENT:So he knows all of them.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, I should--PRESIDENT:Will he rat on us? EHRLICHMAN:Uh, it depends on how he's treated. It'sdependent, it's, see, uh, uh -PRESIDENT:Can we do anything for him? I think webetter.EHRLICHMAN:Wbat he wants, of course is vindication.He's hegatbeen bounced, in effect, and whathe wants is the right to honorably retire and so on. Uh, I think if you did anything for Sullivan, Hoover would be offended,right now, it would have to be a part of thearrangement, whatever it is, that Sullivan could be given an assignment somewhere elsein the Government. And uhPRESIDENT:Out of the Government. Yeah, held be a hellof an operator...EHRLICHMAN:We could use himPRESIDENT:He&#8482;d-do a good job.9EHRLICHMAN:We could use him.PRESIDENT:Hmm, Mitch and I agree EHRLICHMAN:We could, us could use him on other things.PRESIDENT:Liddy's not on your committee?EHRLICHMAN:He's got, he's got a fund of informationand, uh, uh, could do, uh, could do allkinds of intelligence and other work.RESTRICTED-&#64257;B&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:PRESIDENT: EHRLICHMAN:He'd be very, he&#8482;d be very qualified forthat kind of a (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Hoover upsets me. "Is the sun down"? isthat what he calls it?. That's his favorite term.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, and, and, uh, he strictly in Mardian'sorbit. You see he treated with thePRESIDENT:Mardian's the &#64257;Lebanese Jew&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:(Laughs). Ya see that. He&#8482;s treated withthe enemy so, uh, and he has. Sullivan delivered the papers to Mardian that are unbelievable what I've got up in my safe.All the inside documents.[PAUSE]10PRESIDENT:What do you lean to at the moment?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I like your idea. I, uh, haven't-hada chance to think it all through.PRESIDENT:Well, don't mention it to anybody.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I won't. PRESIDENT:The difficulty is that I have decided afterour agonies over the Court that from now on,and incidentally this is the main reason for not submitting it to the Bar in advance. We're just playing everything very close tothe vest and you know, we, it's inevitablearound here (unintelligible) it doesn't affect you so much as it does Kissinger, ofcourse, uh, to a certain extent(unintelligible) Petersen and the vest, where 19 out of 25 bureaus did you see that, in Washington said that the backgrounderswere, uh, quite off the beat and so forthand so on. Well, fine, let's not have them.[7 MINUTE DELETION]PRESIDENT:Well, digression, let me say that I thinkthat the best way to do here is to--I feelit would help us to, as we get closer to election, their only interest is to, itseems to me that everytime we, it gets outthe fact that some poor agent over here (unintelligible) say well that was our last scandal.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. I saw that.PRESIDENT:Who could possibly have done that? EHRLICHMAN:Well, you see the problem.PRESIDENT:Some guy who's tired.EHRLICHMAN:Some low-level guy, in the NSC... PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...could have been called---PRESIDENT:Why the NSC, might have been over in, uhMcGregor's shop.EHRLICHMAN:It could have been, it could have been.11PRESIDENT:Oh. yeah. And there's another greatproblem, John, with these people, with all people, our people, we could have done, wetried our best. There's another greatproblem that, they've all liked to work for an officer and they all like to say thingsthat they're (unintelligible) and also theyall work hard, are tired, and most of them drink...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...and it's then...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...that they...EHRLICHMAN:YeahPRESIDENT:...get in trouble. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah PRESIDENT:I&#8482;ll lay you money that three-fourts of thetime, it's like drunk driving. It&#8482;s threefourths of the time, idiot statements are made when somebody's had a drink, do you not agree?...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, I'm sure that's so.PRESIDENT:...and... EHRLICHMAN:And when they're off--12PRESIDENT:and one of the reasons, one of the reasons,that, uh, back in the campaign, I mean, uh, uh, anybody like, when I go into a campaign,with a press conference and so forth, youhave to be just like a God damn Spartan and then we still make mistakes. But-the pointis, these people, these people that try tohandle things the way they, they just, just, just their judgment floats from people...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:[Laughs] That's right.PRESIDENT:Well, in any case, they've got to(unintelligible) everything they sayEHRLICHMAN:They get caught off guard...PRESIDENT:Then they can't say anything. EHRLICHMAN:at these damn receptions, ya know, the pressare floatin' around and the...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:...people can make a chance remark and, uh,and there it goes.PRESIDENT:But on the Hoover think, I just want this soclosely held this, it's just got to be.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I won't say anything to anybody aboutit. Uh, I,...PRESIDENT:I'll beEHRLICHMAN:...I... PRESIDENT:I'd like for you to be...EHRLICHMAN:...I would like to think about it.13PRESIDENT:I'd like to think about the proposition ofmy saying "Edgar, I think what you should do, that you should get out now, because Idon't want to be in the position of tryingto pick-a successor now, I think you should say this is a matter which should be handledby whoever is the next President in the nextelection and I do not want to be an issue and so I have submitted my resignation effective then. I -There'll be a lot to besaid for that,...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...a lot can be said.EHRLICHMAN:I can see that.PRESIDENT:So that I don't have, I mean, it -then whenyou get his resignation,...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...I've got that, for one thing, but on theother hand, we don't have the agony of his replacement...EHRLICHMAN:YepPRESIDENT:which I think would be a very greatnegative.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. And, before election you can beginthe buildup of the adulation and the...PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:prerequisites and the, and the Medal ofFreedom and all that sort of stuff, uh.PRESIDENT:I could call him, I would tell him right nowif I...I don't know when he should make this announcement, uh, now that's the otherthing, should he do it now?EHRLICHMAN:I think so. And I'll tell you why.14PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:I think this... PRESIDENT:Princeton study?EHRLICHMAN:this Princeton thing is gonna get into thefolklore and it&#8482;s gonna become a part of the givens. It's gonna be a part of the, ofthe-established findings.PRESIDENT:Well, when will that happen? EHRLICHMAN:Well, the, the end of this month. PRESIDENT:They told me that -well, it's a very leftishgroup.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, it is, it's stacked, just stacked PRESIDENT:So--EHRLICHMAN:Uh--PRESIDENT:So we let a man be crucified by a stackedjury.EHRLICHMAN:No, I thinkPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:No, I think if his resignation were in handyou could afford to defend him. And I think you can afford to do a lot of things for himas a lame duck as you get into the campaignwhich-will be appreciated by his, friends and will be virtually uncriticizable. And,and, and I see that as a real--PRESIDENT:Do some thinking about it EHRLICHMAN:I will, I will PRESIDENT:...and I'll tell you what will happen. Thenyou and Herb and, and Mitchell and I willtalk about it.EHRLICHMAN:OkayPRESIDENT:There&#8482;s only the three. There's only oneother one that I might bring in on it is Moore. His, his P.R judgment is not infallible but it, he has good antenna...15EHRLICHMAN:YeahPRESIDENT:...he has a good feel EHRLICHMAN:YeahPRESIDENT:And he doesn't leak.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. All right, well, I won't, I won't sayanything to the two of them, but, uh, whenyou're ready, why, uh, we'll talk about it.PRESIDENT:Well, what I meant is, first, you give ityour judgment.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Oh, wait a minute. You could, no, I'll tellyou what you could do. Don't run it by Mitchell because I need to do that or Ishould feel that, that this is not, I don'twant, him to feel that this idea is coning from somebody else, Mitchell thinks he has to go, but I would like for you to kick itaround, Do you think you should kick itaround with Moore or do you just want to make--EHRLICHMAN:Let me do this. Let me let Moore readLiddy's article and, uh, uh, I've got a copyof it--PRESIDENT:Let me get it out of my file.EHRLICHMAN:Okay -and then I'll...PRESIDENT:He can read my copy. EHRLICHMAN:...I'll talk to Moore. PRESIDENT:I understand. Right.EHRLICHMAN:I've got the only other copy of this.PRESIDENT:And, uh, then Moore? EHRLICHMAN:And then, let Dick and I -Dick and I'vetalked about Hoover's problem before. He'svery concerned about it.16PRESIDENT:But the idea just seems to me to have a lotof merit in avoiding the confirmation fight.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:If we had an outstanding man whoever is sentup oh, for example, a great state attorney general that's, that would be a(unintelligible) pretty good now wouldn'tit.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:I could name a surrogate Pat Brown orsomething like that...EHRLICHMAN:Uh huh. PRESIDENT:...or an Earl Warren...EHRLICHMAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:...that'd be the guy to put... EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...in front of the Bureau. Uh, I don&#8482;tthink a cop should run the Bureau.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. Maybe somebody like, uh,-well, hard to say.PRESIDENT:I don't know.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, no, I don't think it should be apoliceman, I think--PRESIDENT:Policemen are too narrow, too, uh --EHRLICHMAN:It's gotta be a guy with great Hill...PRESIDENT:Did you know (unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:...and P.R. sense--17PRESIDENT:You know, there aren't very many outstandingpeople, I guess, in a P.R. sense in this whole field operation.EHRLICHMAN:I tell you, there's, there's a youngattorney general in my state who's a very classy guy.PRESIDENT:Tell you another one who impresses me, he'sprobably a Democrat, but he is the Attorney General in Arizona.EHRLICHMAN:No, he's a Republican.PRESIDENT:Oh, he's--EHRLICHMAN:He's damn good. PRESIDENT:He said at a meeting there...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...where there were workshops... EHRLICHMAN:Yeah PRESIDENT:...and boy, he was sharp as a...EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:...tack EHRLICHMAN:Well, he's good. Uh, the guy in Illinoisis, this Scott, is pretty good. Uh, he's alittle on the, a little on the liberal side.PRESIDENT:Scott is? EHRLICHMAN:Isn't he?PRESIDENT:Well --EHRLICHMAN:He's, he's all wrapped up in the environmentbusiness...PRESIDENT:That's all right.EHRLICHMAN:...and, uh,...PRESIDENT:Perfectly all right.18EHRLICHMAN:...but, uh, no this, this guy in Arizonais...PRESIDENT:Your guy is good. Well, look at the guy inArizona, we'll put him down as...EHRLICHMAN:I will. PRESIDENT:...I already mentioned this to somebody, butput him down for a promotion because thatguy ought to go to the, easy, he's a future Senator, or a future, uh -EHRLICHMAN:Well, we have, of course, a recruiting, arecruiting problem for Justice, in anyevent, if John leaves.PRESIDENT:I want that man, I want that man forsomething. And the man in your state also.EHRLICHMAN:Well, Gordon is a possibility, although hehas local ambitions, I think. Uh, -PRESIDENT:Interested in running for governor?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Yeah, I don't think he can make itbut he's got those ambitions.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well, on Hoover, when you come downto it, the problem of going through thatconfirmation by, before, I just think isgoing...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...to be insurmountable,EHRLICHMAN:It'd be a bitch. PRESIDENT:But I think what he could do, I really thinkalot, it makes a lot of sense, he says I'mresigning at the end of this year -this ismy last year and I've, uh, talked to the President and, submit...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.19PRESIDENT:I wanta, because of the Bureau, I will nothave the Bureau become an issue in the campaign, I've noted it, and I, and I, Ithink what I will do is just call him in andsay "Edgar, I think you ought to resign and, and, January 1st, 1973.&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:That gives him a three month transition witha new man between the election...PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:...and the, and his retirement, which willbe highly desirable.PRESIDENT:Well, it will be longer than that, you see,the Senate won't confirm...EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's true.PRESIDENT:...till, uh, February,... EHRLICHMAN:Yep, PRESIDENT:...so he's got a long...EHRLICHMAN:He could say I'm kind, I, a-Effective onconfirmation of my successor on or after the first of January.PRESIDENT:That's right, on or after the inauguration.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Okay. I think it would be a, has a hell ofa lot to recommend it, Now everybody that,eager beavers that want to clean up theBureau or the rest of it, we'll wait for that, but you're not gonna clean up much anyway this year. You know, another thingabout this Bureau, do you realize, it'll beone hell of a plum.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Do you know, not one of those people's onCivil Service.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, I know it, I know it. PRESIDENT:I mean, Edgar makes this point, he says itmakes it look (unintelligible) for theBureau. 'Cause everybody's, I mean this is, this is the biggest number of...20EHRLICHMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:...these are Presidential appointments... EHRLICHMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:...apparently, aren't they.EHRLICHMAN:Well, they're dir--, they're appointed bythe Director as a practical matter, oldRonney and, uh, the Hill have a lot to dowith the appointment of these guys.PRESIDENT:But just think of that... EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...they won't have to clear Civil ServiceEHRLICHMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:And incidentally, I am, I am continuing thatissue.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yep, yep. It has... PRESIDENT:Anything come out of that?... EHRLICHMAN:...it has given...PRESIDENT:...or...EHRLICHMAN:...that discipline that this fellow talksabout, uh, that internal discipline that, that has been so important to the success ofthat thing. Uh, well, lemme, lemme thinkabout it and I'll try and make a list of the negatives, if there are any and drop you anote on it.PRESIDENT:There are negatives, just don't drop me anote...EHRLICHMAN:All right.PRESIDENT:...we'll talk about it.EHRLICHMAN:All right21PRESIDENT:We&#8482;ll talk about this and then, we'll talkabout this with you, Moore, and we'll have, uh, and Mitchell, and, uh, no more. Justthose.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:And then maybe we'll move the damn thing.EHRLICHMAN:All righty.PRESIDENT:It'd be great if he would do it. But whatthe hell would he do, what the hell, what can he say to that though? If he's a lameduck.EHRLICHMAN:Ah, that it would impair his, impair hisusefulness is the one, is the one thing thatoccurs to me. And it would be hard for himto maintain internal discipline if everybody knew he was leaving and so on and so forth but hell, everybody knows he's leaving now,you know, it's just a question of time. Andthey all, they all now are on one side or another of either contributing to or slowing down his departure. And there's a, there'san internal war going on there.PRESIDENT:Getting back to the tax thing.
