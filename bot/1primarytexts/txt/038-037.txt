EHRLICHMAN:and uh I've got a, got a, a couple of callscoming in, one from Kalmbach's lawyer anduh, uh, I want to see Dean in the morning also. I've got him coming in and then Ithought I'd see Ziegler, if I can work itin.PRESIDENT:Uh hum. EHRLICHMAN:I'd kinda like to cover several bases.PRESIDENT:Let me say, (clears throat), with Ziegler,I've, the more I think about this, hmm, John, I think we ought to give him the full court.EHRIICHMAN:Get what?PRESIDENT:I think we ought to give him the full court. EHRLICHMAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:I don't think it makes a hell of a lot ofdifference just to hold on Dean and so forth. I'd say since these charges have been made, I think that the men on the WhiteHouse staff that have been charged and soforth, uh, uh, have a right to be heard publicly and uh, I think, and, and, uhthat's that under the, under certain properground rules.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.2EHRLICHMAN:OK, let me run that by Ron in the morningand get him accomodated to it, accustomed toit.PRESIDENT:I know. But, isn't that really what weshould do. I mean, I mean then&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:I feel, I feel it is.PRESIDENT:&#8211;then, then you just, uh, so you try toseparate out and everything then maybe haggle around. You don't get it, but. Andthen maybe you can settle the God damn thingtomorrow with him.EHRLICHMAN:Alright, alright, I, I'm sure I can onthose, on that basis&#8211;PRESIDENT:And say because these charges are justflowing around and leaking and so forth. If you could, you know, give him hell aboutthat.EHRLICHMAN:Alright. PRESIDENT:And that we just can't have that thing uh&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:Right. Right.PRESIDENT:As you know, (clears throat), I was talkingto Bob and uh, Bob made the point. He says, &#64257;Well, just look at the what'll, what'llhappen here." He says, "In a sense uh, soit'll be the evening news, basically then ah, you know what I mean, they aren`t gonna run it live. Not, uh, not now when the.EHRLICHMAN:Uh hum.PRESIDENT:And, uh, also the, there are chances that uhho, how long, how much the committee can do.Particularly with Mitchell or, a somebody...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.3PRESIDENT:his attorney, uh, joining.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Uh, go on for a while. But uh, the, thepoint is, Bob says, "What do you want in the evening news?&#64258; You'll have, you want eitherseven minutes of John Chancellor and Weickerinterpreting what was said in a secret session? Or do you want, uh, four minutes of that and maybe three minutes of Haldeman?"EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's a good point.PRESIDENT:Is it, is that something to be considered? EHRLICHMAN:Sure is. At least we get a little piece ofit that way.PRESIDENT:You know, you see a man looking honest andearnest and so forth, uh, denying it in&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...a public forum where he just&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:you know, its-I just feel&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:Well, there's something that he said forsetting a time limit.PRESIDENT:Yes. And, uh, that&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:Are, are you planning to work tomorrow?PRESIDENT:Well, I'll tell you sure, what I plan to do,I've got to do the Church thing.EHRLICHMAN:Sure. PRESIDENT:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;in the morning and so I may not get there inthe morning Well, anyway, you'll be busy allmorning.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.4EHRLICHMAN:But that's right. I`ve got, I've got plentyto do here.PRESIDENT:So maybe in the afternoon around two o'clockor so, if you want to chat with me, I'll be around.EHRLICHMAN:OK.PRESIDENT:And uh,&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:I'll uh, I'll leave word&#8211; PRESIDENT:We'll see, we'll see, I'll, uh, I'll, I'lldo your other business and so forth. John,uh, to uh, I wonder if we shouldn't reconsider, uh, if you shouldn't, uh, andyou gotta consider this. Uh, rather thanhaving Colson going there completely blind, give him at least a touch up. Or do you think that`s too dangerous?EHRLICHMAN:Uh, say that again, I, I didn't quite hearit.PRESIDENT:Colson, Colson, rather than, rather thanjust saying nothing to him if it just isn'twell to say, "Look may, if you should knowthat uh, Magruder is gonna testify," and and, uh, so forth. Or is that dangerousaccording to Kleindienst?EHRLICHMAN:I don't, uh, I'm not so sure. (Clearsthroat) I'd have to call&#8211;PRESIDENT:I thought Colson knows what the hell to&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:...I have to call him anyway tomorrow. He'sgotta, he's got an urgent call in for me.PRESIDENT:Another urgent call, huh.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, um, I don't think I want to say anythingat all to him about John. John incidentally, I understand was on the CBS news and just hard-lined them.PRESIDENT:Oh, I don't, I agree on John.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.5EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:I know, but about Magruder, that's what Imeant.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I can, I can say something very brief.I don't need to indicate&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...that, that he said anything to me. PRESIDENT:Yeah. But that, you understand, that he hastalked. I mean, uh, &#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Right. I could, I could&#8211;PRESIDENT:Not to the Grand Jury but&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:I think I could safely go that far&#8211;PRESIDENT:...and say that, uh, he should know thatbefore he goes and...EHRLICHMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:&#8211;be prepared to&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:I'll, I'll call him in the morning.PRESIDENT:...uh, let me put it this way. I do thinkwe owe it to Chuck to at least...EHRLICHMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:...so that he doesn't, I mean, go in thereand uh, and uh, frankly I'm, I'm on the perjury rap.EHRLICHMAN:I understand.PRESIDENT:Uh. EHRLICHMAN:I don't, I don't think he's, uh, he's in anydanger on that but, uh, uh, &#8211;PRESIDENT:Well, why wouldn't he be in any danger?Could you, well he got his story, and&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.6PRESIDENT:...and knows pretty well what&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:&#8211;he s going to say.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, he's pretty, I think Ws pretty pat.But I will talk to him in the morning, and,and, give him a cautionary note, anyway.PRESIDENT:Of course, his urgent call may be just whatwe know, or it may be, uh, more of something on our friend, uh&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Um.PRESIDENT:...what's that other guy, uh, Hunt. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Ain't a God damn thing you can to about thateither.EHRLICHMAN:No. No. I'll tell you, I'm um I'm going touh, probably see Kleindienst in the, ohsometime tomorrow.PRESIDENT:Um hum. EHRLICHMAN:And if for any reason you don't find methere that's probably where I am.PRESIDENT:And with him on the Special Prosecutor say,"Look, Dick, that is, in view of the fact that the U.S. Attorney is now doing such athorough job and since there's going to bedefinite results from it, it would be a terrible reflection on the system of justice&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:&#64257;&#8211;and this administration. We`d be ineffect admitting that uh, the JusticeDepartment was so corrupt that we, itcouldn't prosecute." But God Almighty, if they prosecute a former Attorney General, Jesus, John, what more can you ask?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.7EHRLICHMAN:But pretty, pretty loose, (laughs), prettyindependent.PRESIDENT:I really, I really feel that.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:And, uh, and that the Special Prosecutorthing can only open other avenuespotentially. Uh, I don't mean that there's anything we want to cover up, but, uh, you know, he has to go through and&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Well, uh, I think it's just folly.PRESIDENT:Don't you think so? EHRLICHMAN:Yes sir!PRESIDENT:And that, that's, that Dick could just saythat you there's a difference of opinion, but this is it.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. I'll do it.PRESIDENT:Well, I've decided it then that uh, he&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:He wants to talk to you about it. But, Ithink I can take care of it tomorrow&#8211;PRESIDENT:Uh um.EHRLICHMAN:...without any problem.PRESIDENT:But if it's necessary for him to come in andme to tell him that, I'll tell him.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, I think I can handle it.PRESIDENT:Now wait a minute, I'm not uh EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...adverse to it because&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:OK.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.8PRESIDENT:I think, my feeling frankly is this, thatuh, you know I was just thinking tonight asI was making up my notes for this littletalk. You know, what the hell, if, if, it's, I mean, if, if, it is a littlemelodramatic, but it's totally true thatwhat happens in this office in these next four years will determine, could, will probably determine whether there is achance, and God damn it's never(unintelligible) uh, what you could have uh, some sort of an uneasy peace for&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Um hum.PRESIDENT:&#8211;the next twenty-five years. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:And that's, that's my, what ever legacy wehad, hell it isn't going to be in getting acesspool for Winnetka. It's going to be there.EHRLICHMAN:Yep. YepPRESIDENT:And uh I and uh, I just feel that, uh, I'vegot to be in the position to be a, be clean and forthcoming and so forth. That's why Ithink that on the&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Well, I totally agree with that. PRESIDENT:...on the committee, out so forth and so on. EHRLICHMAN:I totally agree with that.PRESIDENT:Uh. we, think a little bit more about theHaldeman thing. My present thing is a, he raised it himself you know, this business,and uh, but uh, God I, I just, I just thinkyou gotta fight for somebody. I don't know, but uh, what's your feeling at the moment?EHRLICHMAN:I don't think he's in that bad shape. I maybe kidding myself but I&#8211;APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.9PRESIDENT:Uh, the only thing that concerns me is whatthey said about Strachan.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, well,PRESIDENT:You don't think that relates that close&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:Let me, let me talk to him tomorrow and justsee how much of that we have to swallow. Hemay, he may object to some of that, and uh, with good basis. So I'm&#8211;PRESIDENT:&#8211;so, you've gotta figure this too on, onMagruder, if I could suggest it. Uh,Magruder's probably believes he is telling what he knows.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:On the other hand, oh, this happened a longtime ago and Magruder is a, is a very facile liar&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:...and, uh, he could well be thrashingaround a bit here and uh, drawing conclusions and so forth and so on.EHRLICHMAN:Believes his own stories.PRLSIDENT:Yes. What do you think, I mean, becausesome of this&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'll tell ya, uh, they, they told methat he was an extremely credible witness.PRESIDENT:Yep. EHRLICHMAN:And uh, I can see why. He, he comes acrossvery sincere, very earnest, and uh, verybelievable.PRESIDENT:Uh um. That's right.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.10EHRLICHMAN:And, but of course, uh, ya, ya have to,you'd have to balance what he says. A lotof what he says, uh, I have no way of, ofcorroborating or not corroborating.PRESIDENT:You've gotta balance what he says with thefact that he was very believable when helied.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, that's what I say. PRESIDENT:Now the question is, uh, how much of this isthe truth and how much is it&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...something he believes to be the truth.EHRLICHMAN:Well, ab, about the only thing I can say isthat it sounded credible but I, I can't vouch for it obviously.PRESIDENT:Um hum.EHRLICHMAN:And that's one of the reasons why I want toget Gordon in.PRESIDENT:One last thing. How do you, how do you seethe Mitchell scenario, uh, rolling out, uh,John, uh, put yourself in his position andjust, just sort of ruminate a bit and tell me how you see it rolling out.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I would&#8211;PRESIDENT:First, you, you, you, you are convinced hewill be indicted. Are you?EHRLICHMAN:Uh, yes.PRESIDENT:You are.EHRLICHMAN:I don't think there is one chance in, uh,fifty&#8211;PRESIDENT:Alright.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.11EHRLICHMAN:...that he won't be.PRESIDENT:Alright, now&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Uh, the uh, the court will open and publishthem and then uh, he will probably arrange to come down and take delivery of the uh&#8211;PRESIDENT:...indictment.EHRLICHMAN:...indictment. And, uh, I would guess hewill hire F. Lee Bailey. That would be my hunch.PRESIDENT:Um hum. Not a bad idea.EHRLICHMAN:Bailey will, he, he's got one problem inthat the firm represents one of the otherdefendants. But uh&#8211;PRESIDENT:Uh hum. EHRLICHMAN:...he may be able to get around that. PRESIDENT:Uh hum.EHRLICHMAN:And uh, whoever he gets will immediatelymove for a change of venue&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...and file eighty-nine motions.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, PRESIDENT:Motions to quash, motions&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:...to, to dis&#8211;PRESIDENT AND EHRLICHMAN:...to disqualify the judge EHRLICHMAN:...and, uh, attacking the legality of theGrand Jury and everything you can imagine.Uh...APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.12PRESIDENT:Won't that take a little time?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. You bet it will. My hunch isthat the soonest he could get a case likethat to trial would be the, the, the fall. September, October.PRESIDENT:Really?EHRLICHMAN:Something of that kind. PRESIDENT:Well, that, that leaves the committeehanging for a while, I suppose&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Well,PRESIDENT:...that's good or not. EHRLICHMAN:I don't think they would let the committeeproceed in the meantime.PRESIDENT:You don't really&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:I mean they would use every effort to stopit and, I'm just guessing but just commonsense tells me that they, they could stopit. I don't know the law. But uh&#8211;PRESIDENT:One long shot. Should you talk to Ervin? EHRLICHMAN:Should I?PRESIDENT:Yep.EHRLICHMAN:Confide in him? PRESIDENT:Not totally.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, I don't think so. I can't trust him.PRESIDENT:Oh, I don't trust him at all. EHRLICHMAN:Um, no, I can't. I, I just&#8211;APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.13PRESIDENT:OK.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;wouldn't dare.PRESIDENT:Alright.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, Kleindienst might at some later time. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) make the deal.EHRLICHMAN:And, but uh,PRESIDENT:But make the deal. And I think, franklylet's get off of the God damn Executive Privilege.EHRLICHMAN:Get a little ride on it, huh, while we can.PRESIDENT:Well, at least it's a, I do think it willcool a little of the uh, the Congressionalstuff, you know.EHRLICHMAN:Uh hum. PRESIDENT;I really do. I mean&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:Uh hum.PRESIDENTL...as I read the Congressional stuff.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:I I say what the Christ, they can`tunderstand this or that&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...or the other thing. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Alright. Now, we, we're, we`re basically,also, it's bold, the President just said the, it's enough of this nonsense&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Um hum.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.14PRESIDENT:Now we're going to fight.EHRLICHMAN:Um hum.PRESIDENT:You see what I mean?EHRLICHMAN:I get ya. OK, uh, PRESIDENT:And it puts&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:It suits me.PRESIDENT:...it puts the President in a position of a,of being as forthcoming as we can, want the facts out.EHRLICHMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:...and uh, and uh, that's that. And I'mnot, and I'm not concerned about the wordbacking off and so forth. So sure, we'llback off.So that's a story for about two days.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Really.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. I, I think that's great. PRESIDENT:We've done lots of things with the Congress.We lose one. But, we, but you, ininterpreting it would say we've reached acompromise&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:...with the committee.EHRLICHMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:Uh, it will be limited to this uh, tocharges of wrongdoing.EHRLICHMAN:Uh hum.PRESIDENT:Right?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.15EHRLICHMAN:Uh hum. And they came a long way on therules.PRESIDENT:Hum. The rules now are provide adequateprotection for&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:&#8211;Executive Privilege and uh, so thePresident says, "Have them all go."EHRLICHMAN:Yep. I think that's great. PRESIDENT:But, putting it in the point that thePresident directed it&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:&#8211;and I think the&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:&#8211;I think that an idea that the President isstepped into this damn thing and says "Look God damn it let's get this stuff...EHRLICHMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:"&#8211;done." EHRLICHMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:And, and, you, you go out and say thePresident says "Look, we've had enough talk,enough uh, bitching," and I think uh, and incidentally I wouldn't uh, I wouldn't justdo it lightly, but I think uh this Lipschitzthat uh, that ought to be, that uh, that the, the committee would, would hire with knowledge a bugger.EHRLICHMAN:Uh um.PRESIDENT:I don't know, that doesn't, that sound alittle bad to you?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, we ought to be able to get a good rideon that.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.16PRESIDENT:Uh, yo, uh, maybe I'm been wishful thinkingbut I think its a, I think it's almost, uh,unbelievable that they knew it. And I thinkyou should ask Ervin. "Ervin, Senator, did you know this?" Wouldn't you think so?EHRLICHMAN:I oughta, I oughta have some real fun withthat.PRESIDENT:And uh, but, when you're on a battle, andyou re going to fight a God damn battleyou're going to fight it to the finish.EHRLICHMAN:Fair enough. PRESIDENIT:And uh, the thing about uh, Bob, as I say isthis, that uh, I get back to a fundamentalpoint. Is he guilty or is he not? In my view he is not. Ya know.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And if he isn't, Jesus Christ, uh, uh, evenif it means that the whole country and the Congress and uh, all the members of the House and the Senate say, "Resign, resign,"the President says, "No. I will not, uh,take a, take an innocent, a man who is innocent. That's wrong, that's contrary toour system and I'm going to fight&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Um hum PRESIDENT:"&#8211;Fight for him." and uh, if., if evidenceis brought out to the contrary, fine. Butuh, then we'll take a look at it. Butthat's...EHRLICHMAN:...Well that's, that's another reason forputting his statement out, it seems to me.It's the standard that you're flying, so to speak. So they'll shoot at it. But if they, if they never hit it, why then, youknow, there's no room for argument.PRESIDENT:You get that statement broadly circulated. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.17PRESIDENT:What about, incidentally, uh, how about thedrill of frankly telling our own leadersthat and uh, getting them maybe charged up alittle on this. And including, uh&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Well, I've been doing a little thinkingabout that. I'm, I'm not so sure until we,we wind out the whole Judicial process here. The, the, the Grand Jury process that you're really going to be in much of a position todo that. We can--uh, I'll give that somemore thought but uh&#8211;PRESIDENT:You mean, uh, that because something's goingto come out of the Grand Jury.EHRLICHMAN:Ya, yeah, you have sort of a half told tale. PRESIDENT:Yeah, you can say, &#64257;Well, look I`m speakingjust for the White House staff and uh,they're going to go up and testify.EHRLICHMAN:Um hum. PRESIDENT:"Now fellows, uh, give em a chance." EHRLICHMAN:Um hum.PRESIDENT:That's what I meant.EHRLICHMAN:I get ya. Uh, that at least, sure&#8211; PRESIDENT:...and, aft&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:...after you give them a chance then thePresident, uh, that they've all, then you say they've all given sworn statements onthis thing and uh, we uh, we feel that uh,that we, we are uh, uh, we are due, owe our day in court and so forth and so on and&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:...here's a, here's a copy of Haldeman'sstatement.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.18PRESIDENT:That's right,EHRLICHMAN:Um hum. Now we could certainly do thatwithout making reference to the other.PRESIDENT:Including Agnew and so forth. EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, you could, you could, trace thehistory of our attempt to cooperate withErvin. Tell them about that.Privileged material deleted.PRESIDENT:Fine. Well John, you've had a hell of aweek, two weeks and that's a, and of coursepoor Bob is out going through the tortures of the damned.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, that family thing is rough.PRESIDENT:I know, the family thing and, but, but withthe, apart from the family thing, you know, here's a guy that, Christ, has just givenhis life, hours and hours and hours, youknow, without, totally selfless and honest and decent, that's another thing. God damn it to hell, I just am about, about to, aboutto say well you know, you get, you get, youget the argument of some anybody that, anybody that's been charged against firehim. Jesus Christ, I mean, you can't, youcan't do that, John.EHRLICHMAN:Um bum. PRESIDENT:Or, or am I wrong? I don't know.EHRLICHMAN:No, you're right.PRESIDENT:Well, maybe I'm not right. I asked you, EHRLICHMAN:Well, it's either you are&#8211;PRESIDENT:You'd say, you'd say clean the boards.Well, God is that our system?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.19EHRLICHMAN:Well, that isn't a system. That's you know,that's a machine.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:That's, that's uh part of&#8211; PRESIDENT:But, how do you feel, honestly? I mean, you,cause we apart from the personal feelings weboth have for Bob, don't you? You know I raised this myself. I said, Well, one way out is say &#64257;Well, look, as long as all ofthese guys have been charged, out they goand uh, then they can fight this battle and they can return when they get, get cleared.&#64258;Not good. Is it?EHRLICHMAN:You know. I don't think it is. Uh, I don'tthink that's any way to run a railroad. I just think you've gotta have&#8211;PRESIDENT:I suppose that would probably be the view ofthe purists. Uh, what does Len think on that? Does he think that really?EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. I, I think you have to uh, &#8211;PRESIDENT:... Well, that's irrelevant&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:...you have to show some, some heart on thething.PRESIDENT:Well, the point, is you know uh, whatever wesay about Harry Truman, you know and so forth, while it hurt him, a lot of people admired the old bastard for standing bypeople who,&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Sure. PRESIDENT:...who were, who&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:...who were really guilty as hell. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Yeah.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.20PRESIDENT:Uh, and uh, damn it. I'm, I'm, I'm thatkind of person. I'm not one that's gonna,gonna, gonna say, "Look, before this guy'sunder attack. I, I, I, I, I'd drop 'em."EHRLICHMAN:UM.PRESIDENT:Don't you, uh, is there something to be saidfor that or not?EHRLICHMAN:Uh, I don't -think uh, number one I don'tthink you'd gain anything by it, if aproblem doesn't go awry.PRESIDENT:No, they'll say, "Oh, Jesus that does showthat Nixon here is, here is top person, theclosest man to him, in the office four orfive hours a day, and out he goes."EHRLICHMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:But, Christ everything must be wrong.EHRLICHMAN:Yep, that's it.PRESIDENT:and, and&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:...then separate the Siamese twins. PRESIDENT:We've done so many good things, you know,which Bob has worked on so arduously and uh,God damn it, so there will be, there will be fragments here and there, but Christ we,people, make mistakes. You don't fire a guyfor a mistake, do you?EHRLICHMAN:No. PRESIDENT:No, not for a, not for a well intentionedmistake.EHRLICHMAN:No, that's right, that`s right. PRESIDENT:But, uh, I just uh, I, I, I have a view ofdrawing up the line. At one point you`regoing to talk to Dean.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.21EHRLICHMAN:I am. I, I&#8211;PRESIDENT:What are you going to say to him?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'm gonna try and get him, I'm gonnatry and get him around a bit, but it's going to be delicate.PRESIDENT:Get him around in what way?EHRLICHMAN:Well to uh, to uh, get off this uh, passingthe buck business. It's&#8211;PRESIDENT:...John, that's&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:...It's a little touchy and I don't&#8211;PRESIDENT:John, that's&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:...and I don't know how far I can go.PRESIDENT:...not going to, uh, that's not going tohelp you. Look, he's gotta look down the road to, to one point. But, uh, there's only one man that could restore him to theability to practice law in the case thingsstill go wrong.EHRLICHMAN:Um hum. Um hum. PRESIDENT:Now that uh, uh, he's got to have that inthe back of his mind.EHRLICHMAN:Um hum. PRESIDENT:And he's got to know that'll happen. Youknow, I don't, you don't tell himEHRLICHMAN:Um hum. PRESIDENT:but you know and I know that EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.22PRESIDENT:with him and Mitchell, there isn't gonna bea God damn question. Because we got a bumrap. God damn it if Lipschitz gets off witha&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:&#8211;with copping a plea&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:(Laughs) PRESIDENT:and, and, getting a suspended sentence,what in the name of Christ is this allabout. All that it involves, of course, wehave to be fair, it involves, uh, the highest...EHRLICHMAN:The king of the mountain&#8211;PRESIDENT:The king of the mountain&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...the, uh, trying to keep, uh, suppress thefacts and so forth. I do, and I think youthought I was sort of, sort of being facetious about saying get everybody, all these people and this includes LaRue, andMardian and of course uh, of courseKalmbach. Uh, they've gotta have it and Dean too. They've gotta have a straightdamn line that, of course we raised money.Be very honest about it. But, uh, we raised money for a purpose that we thought was perfectly proper.EHRLICHMAN:Um hum. Uh hum.PRESIDENT:But we didn't want to shut 'em up. Thesemen were guilty.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Right? EHRLICHMAN:Right.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.23PRESIDENT:And uh, they are, we weren't trying to shutthem up, we just didn`t, we didn't want 'emto talk to the press.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah. PRESIDENT:That's perfectly legitimate, isn't it? Oris it? Legitimate not to want them to talkto the press.EHRLICHMAN:I think it is. I uh, I, I don't have aperfect understanding of the, of the law onthat and I&#8211;PRESIDENT:You'd say that old Dick was really shaken? EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:He really was. PRESIDENT:God damn it. I, I told him once, I said,"Dick, I said, the real target here isMitchell." He said, "Oh no, it can't be."You know, now, he's sort of got the idea, I think, that probably it's Haldeman or Colson.EHRLICHMAN:Well, he uh, he, I'm sure he's going to callme first thing in the morning.PRESIDENT:Yeah. But with him I would be very tough,I'd say, "Dick, uh, let's not crap around, Imean, they're after Mitclell and they're going to get him, at the present time. At least that's what our evidence, that's what,what our information&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:um hum. PRESIDENT:&#8211;indicates&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Um hum.PRESIDENT:...and so here's where we go." EHRLICHMAN:And he's probably doing a little checkingwith his U.S. Attorney tonight.PRESIDENT:He'd do that?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.24EHRLICHMAN:Oh sure, sure. He has to make the ultimateprosecutive decision or else he has to del,delegate it to somebody. So he's entitledto know&#8211;PRESIDENT:Your poing is that he would delegate to theDean. I think that the Dean is the best oneto delegate it to.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, I do too. PRESIDENT:Rather than you know, rather than, John, thesuggestion that well you resign and thenwe'll put another Attorney General. That would be a, &#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Um hum.PRESIDENT:...that would be a hell of an admission thatChrist, that we thought...EHRLICHMAN;He, he isn't gonna want to do that would bemy guess. He isn't gonna want to resign atthis point.PRESIDENT:He shouldn't, uh, you know, when I come tothink about it. I think that he should forother reasons. But uh, Jesus, if we couldget the Ellsberg case over, I'd just like to get that FBI&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Um hum, uh hum.PRESIDENT:Is there any way at all that you can? You'regoing to talk to Ziegler-that you can get out the fact that you, you have conducted athorough investigation?EHRLICHMAN:We'll work on that. I think there is. PRESIDENT:I think we have to get that out&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:...don't you?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.25EHRLICHMAN:I think so.PRESIDENT:The President is calling the signals.EHRLICHMAN:I, I suspect that somebody's going to put ittogether. I, my, hunch is the New York Times will. They`re going to put together,you see, they have the story that Colson wasin yesterday.PRESIDENT:And they know that Mitchell was in. EHRLICHMAN:And, of course, the, all the wires have thatMitchell was in today.PRESIDENT:They have? Um hum. EHRLICHMAN:So, uh, somebody's going to start stringingall this together.PRESIDENT:And so what would happen? You'd have Ziegleror yourself go out and say, "Yes, I have seen them." Or you, haven't thought thatthrough.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think I'd, I wouldn't have to sayI'd seen them. I could a, we could a, say that uh we, we`ve had a job of work going onfor several years.PRESIDENT:But you can say that the President, becauseof the charges that have been made, wantedan independent investigation made. And heordered, directed you to make it.EHRLICHMAN:Um hum. PRESIDENT:You've made an independent investigation ofthe situation, because the President wants,if there's anybody is, who is guilty in this thing, he said, uh, he must through theJudicial processes be brought to, brought tothe bar. Is that what you'd say?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.26EHRLICHMAN:Yep. Well, or, or simply to aid you in uh,in uh, analyzing the steps that ought to betaken here. You`re, you`re being asked todo a lot&#8211;PRESIDENT:You could say the President&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;of quite extraordinary things.PRESIDENT:You could say, "The President, Presidentwants this matter cleaned up, once and for all."EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:It's been hanging around and yacked aboutand innocent people have been hurt in theprocess&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:...and charges are being throwing around nowwe`ve got a Judicial process and we wantthis thing...EHRLICHMAN:Beyond that&#8211; PRESIDENT:...finished. EHRLICHMAN:...beyond that you`ve had all kinds ofSenators and Congressmen calling for theappointment of uh,&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;of uh, special commissions and all thatkind of thing...PRESIDENT:So you're it. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;for, for, uh, you uh, to come to any sortof a judgment on those kinds of proposalsyou have to, have a pretty clear understanding of the facts.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.27PRESIDENT:Right. Well, with Dean, I think you couldtalk to him in confidence about uh, about athing like that, don't you? He isn't gonna&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:I'm not sure. I, I just don't know how, howmuch to lean on&#8211;PRESIDENT:I see.EHRLICHMAN:...that reed at the moment. But, uh, I'llsound it out.PRESIDENT:Well, you start with the proposition, "Dean,uh, the President thinks you've just been a,you know, you've carried a tremendous load and he has, his affection and loyalty to youis just undiminished&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Alright. PRESIDENT:"&#8211;And uh, now let's see where the hell we goand&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Uh Hum.PRESIDENT:&#64257;&#8211;we can`t get the President involved inthis." His people, just, I mean that's one thing we don't want to cover up, but uh&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...uh, there are ways that he can and thenhe's got to say that, that, for example, youstart with him certainly on the business ofthe obstruction of justice.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. That's right. PRESIDENT:Say, "Look John, let's, we need a plan here&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Um hum.PRESIDENT:&#64257;...And uh,&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:Um hum.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.28PRESIDENT:&#64257;&#8211;so that uh, so that LaRue, Mardian and a,a, the others." I mean Christ, uh&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. I'm not sure I can go that far withhim.PRESIDENT:No. He killed (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) I'll sound it out.PRESIDENT:Right. Well, get a good night's sleep. EHRLICHMAN:Thank you sir. PRESIDENT:I'll bet you do&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Alright.PRESIDENT:...sleep well. And if you don't have a way,it's a curious thing, uh, not curious at allbut uh, John it's, it's, it's just, it'swell, it's terribly painful of course, and I was thinking you know, to have, to go to that damn dinner tonight.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:But my point is, well, it is painful and Ijust feel better about getting the God damn thing done.EHRLICHMAN:Good.PRESIDENT:Or, or do you agree? EHRLICHMAN:Absolutely.PRESIDENT:And after all, I'm, it's my job and I don'twant this, I don't want the Presidency tarnished, but also I don't, I, I, I`m a law enforcement man.EHRLICHMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:And, right? EHRLICHMAN:Yep, and you've got to move on to moreimportant things.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 11:22 TO 11:53 P.M.29PRESIDENT:Yeah, that's right. OK buddy.EHRLICHMAN:Alright sir.PRESIDENT:See you tomorrow.
