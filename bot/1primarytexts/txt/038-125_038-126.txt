Nobody seems to have any idea what it is.Ehrlichman had some (unintelligible) on itthat it was, that, was offered to Silbert at some point and he didn't want it. Whish hasput him in a very awkwardAPRIL 19, 1973,FROM 9:37 P.M. TO 9:53 P.M.2HALDEMANCONT.:position which is lie is on.. He'sdenouncing all thetiqhole story aspreposterous.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) denouncing it.HALDEMAN:Silbert is, yeah.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) What is this? Eight casesof stuff that was carried out of the White House. Is that what it is?HALDEMAN:That's what they say. Out of Hunt's, it wasthe contents of Hunt's desk.PRESIDENT:Eight cases?HALDEMAN:Ha ha. Six cases I guess.PRESIDENT:Oh, that's what it is. HALDEMAN:Six cartons (unintelligible) PRESIDENT:And carried to where, to an apartment?HALDEMAN:It was taken to someplace where it wasstored somewhere by this guy's client. This guy's a lawyer who's telling the story. He says his client stored it for the summer andthen returned it to the Committee toRe-elect just before the election.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) that have been, hmm?HALDEMAN:Which is weird story.PRESIDENT:They have it now then. They have thematerial?HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) they don't. I don't knowwhere the material is. (Unintelligible)apparently as, as all this stuff is coming out this guy's scared he's going to get hungon an obstruction of justice thing and sohe's going in and filing notice that, that ah he knew about this...APRIL 19, 1973,FROM 9:37 P.M. TO 9:53 P.M.3PRESIDENT:Who is the guy, Bob? Is he somebody thatworked for the Committee or...HALDEMAN:It's a lawyer. I don't know who his clientis.PRESIDENT:That's w hat I meant. Who's the client?HALDEMAN:I don't know. I haven't any idea who hisclient is. He ah, he won't say. (Pause)That's very strange.PRESIDENT:Colson doesn't really know?HALDEMAN:I don't know. I haven't, ah, John Ehrlichmantalked to Colson about it so he may have moreof a reading on it.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) just another - another one ofthose things.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) run all the way through withJohn. We have another one that, that ah, thePost going to tell the story tomorrow.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:This is an associate of John Deans', who isseeking to make John Dean's version of thiswhole thing public so that Dean, in histestimony before the Grand Jury will implicate people above and below himself and will statethat Haldeman engineered a cover-up to hidethe involvement of a pre presidential aides inthe (unintelligible) operation, and that oneclose associate said that Dean is prepared totell whatever that ah, whatever role he mighthave played in the Watergate case came as a result of orders from superiors in the WhiteHouse, despite the allegations Dean had noadvance knowledge of the bugging, that thetruth is long and broad and it goes up anddown, higher and lower, and that they can'tmake a case that this was just Mitchell andDean. Dean will welcome the opportunity totell his side to the Grand Jury. He's notgoing to go down in flames for the activities of others. The Post called the White Housefor comment on that...APRIL 19, 1973,FROM 9:37 P.M. TO 9:53 P.M.4PRESIDENT:Oh boy.HALDEMAN:...tried to reach me, I guess, for comment.(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:And ah (unintelligible) this guy, that hecalled, he tried to reach Dean and finally got through to him and he's having his callsscreened by Fielding and he's hiding in ahotel somewhere. Dean called him back...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:And ah, Ron gave him the story and Dean saidhis first comment was "Oh fuck". And then hesaid I sus...I have a pretty good suspicion who it is and he's got things scrambled. Inever mentioned Haldeman. I just said higherup and (unintelligible) apparently. And hesaid, then Ron said will "Why don't you callthe Post and (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...the story's not true before they run it.Dean said "Well Ron there's some fact and somefiction in it and (unintelligible) call them and deny it". And ah, he said why, Dean thensaid to Ron "Why don't you call the Post andsay that they can't run the story unless Deanconfirms it and Dean hasn't confirmed it."Ron said "That's ridiculous John and you knowit. They won't (unintelligible) suggestedthat Dean have Fielding call the Post and handle it. And Dean said "Well I, maybe I cando that. I want you to know I'm not playinggames. This is a fishing type story andthey're just trying to smoke something out."A w-, later Dean called Ron back, just aminute ago as a matter of fact, and he said "Ican't call the Post, but why don't you Ron?Call the guy from the Post and say that youhave talked with me and that at no time did I say that Haldeman was in (unintelligible)(Pause)PRESIDENT:Well, so (unintelligible)APRIL 19, 1973,FROM 9:37 P.M. TO 9:53 P.M.5HALDEMAN:So Ron's going to try that but...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...he's afraid that Dean cleverly waited&#8218;til 9:30 to tell him that so that it would be too late to change the story.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) this is a-Look Bob, theseare the things we, we, we sort of expect this don't we?HALDEMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:...the Dean thing. And ah, we just standfirm on it. That's all, don't you agree? What the hell else can you do?HALDEMAN:I don't think, I don't think we want to(unintelligible), more of it lying down than we have to.PRESIDENT:I agree, I agree, I--except I don't knowwhat the hell to do with Dean, that's theproblem, isn't that it?HALDEMAN:Dean's obviously got other people playinghis game now, that are tougher than heintends to.PRESIDENT:His lawyer probably, huh? HALDEMAN:I would say his lawyer, yeah.PRESIDENT:His associates up and down, huh. Was hereferring to Ehrlichman and you and who the, whose down?HALDEMAN:Well, Colson...PRESIDENT:Colson, of course.HALDEMAN:Or it could be people over at the Committeeor ah, you know, LaRue and Mitchell...PRESIDENT:Mitchell, right.HALDEMAN:All sorts of people.APRIL 19, 1973,FROM 9:37 P.M. TO 9:53 P.M.6PRESIDENT:Your fellows, I asked them their judgmentand they said that (unintelligible) forwhatever it's worth, I mean they don't buythe Garment theory. Da, you know.HALDEMAN:You mean -on, on our taking any actionnow.PRESIDENT:One might, ah, yes, on... HALDEMAN:On you taking any action now. PRESIDENT:...on resigning. They said, well, just haveto, course with all this, you have toremember they said that they didn't see that it would, they, they, they, they just, ah,it would be uh, admission of guilt, that'swhat they&#8482;ed say.HALDEMAN:Well, I think they're right. PRESIDENT:That's the point, so ah, we're going to haveto fight it out.HALDEMAN:An admission of guilt (unintelligible) aslong as everywhere else really, really screws things up.PRESIDENT:But the point is that what you do is to letthem run their story and then ah, ah, their stories and so forth and so on, but then wehave to play it as they say, day by day andthe U.S. Attorney is uh, is confronted with a tough choice, whether he's gonna indict or put you on a list of non-indictable people.HALDEMAN:Or nothing at all, which is what they thinkhe's going to do.PRESIDENT:At this moment, yes.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:They don't think he's got corroboration butif he doesn't, why that's, that's fine, and ah...HALDEMAN:They probably told you they find this wholeprocedure highly...APRIL 19, 1973,FROM 9:37 P.M. TO 9:53 P.M.7PRESIDENT:Yes.HALDEMAN:...irregular.PRESIDENT:Yeah, they do, they do, but they say it'sdone, it's done, it's irregular but it's done.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Ah... HALDEMAN:That guy's really an interesting guy. PRESIDENT:Yeah, he sure is. I like 'em both.HALDEMAN:I do, too.PRESIDENT:But they ah, but they both say they have, Idon't think they've seen these stories, butI mean they aren't going to be effected bystories that come out. I told &#8218;em I said "You're gonna have a hell of a lot of stories here, it's gonna be blasting off."And, ah, I think you gotta expect more ofit, don't you?HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Yeah. We just batten down the hatches andtake it, isn't that right?HALDEMAN:I'm not sure how, (Unintelligible)' We'vegotta, well, we&#8482;ve gotta get the legal partperfected...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...and then we've gotta move on thepublic...PRESIDENT:On the PR.HALDEMAN:...We can't just hunker down and take itfor, for...PRESIDENT:I.agree, I agree. They, they of courseruled, I didn't talk to 'em about, what, what do they think about your making a statement or something or that sort ofthing, they...HALDEMAN:They're worried about it, but they, see, intheir, they're not close to it...APRIL 19, 1973,FROM 9:37 P.M. TO 9:53 P.M.8PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...at this point...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...I think there's, you know, we can....

Itmay be that we ought not to be gone this weekend.PRESIDENT:Ought to work with your attorney.HALDEMAN:Yeah, yeah. PRESIDENT:Probably so, probably so, but do what youwant.

TO 9:53 P.M.9PRESIDENT:Nice, hell, it's just whatever you want, youknow, your...HALDEMAN:It ah, we were concerned about appearance ifwe don't go, or if I don't, but I don't really think that matters much,especially...PRESIDENT:No. HALDEMAN:...because it's Easter... PRESIDENT:It's Easter, you're going to stay with yourfamily.HALDEMAN:No, I hadn't thought about it. And we canjust say you're going down to spend Easterwith your family and we're spending Easterwith our families.PRESIDENT:That's right. It's a family deal, sure. HALDEMAN:If we don't go, ah, wha, what we might do ifit's okay, is go up to Camp David...PRESIDENT:Right, right. HALDEMAN:...for a day or two.

TO 9:53 P.M.10HALDEMANCONT:support anybody. Don't say you'll stand byus or anything.PRESIDENT:Well., why not? I mean that ah... HALDEMAN:I just don't think you should. Look thereare so many weird bounces in this, if one ofus gets a bad bounce at some point and has to do something then don't you (unintelligible) in your face.PRESIDENT:Right. (Unintelligible) I say then, thatwe've ah, (unintelligible) investigating this whole thing, that I ah...HALDEMAN:And that I'm not going to mention any names.PRESIDENT:Any names. HALDEMAN:Because, because, as I said publicly I willsay privately to you. I. I, there is goingto be no cover up in this...PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:And ah... PRESIDENT:And that there's, there never...HALDEMAN:This is gonna, that uh our record on thisinvestigation is gonna prove that we've done everything we could in the proper fashion.PRESIDENT:Right. That's what you say.HALDEMAN:Effecting both the need to prosecute and theneed to protect.PRESIDENT:Right. You&#8482;d prefer it and rather, andrather than, rather than to say that I standby Ehrlichman and Haldeman and that sort of thing, that's what I would (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Because, see, the thing is nobody yet has,has(unintelligible) a word about, really about Ehrlichman and and they're now all saying that there is no evidence on me.APRIL 19, 1973,FROM 9:37 P.M. TO 9:53 P.M.11PRESIDENT:Until this story that&#8482;s uh a, Dean, though.HALDEMAN:Well yeah, that's right, and that's Dean andthat, it may not go out.PRESIDENT:Ah, ah, the Post would use it, don't youthink?HALDEMAN:I don't know, they may not. Tell me what,there's a...PRESIDENT:It's a dangerous thing. HALDEMAN:...(unintelligible) being played here.There's a lot of rough games being playedhere and...it'sPRESIDENT:They may be afraid of the libel?HALDEMAN:We come out better playing a strong gamethen we do a weak game, all the way along, but I don't think in that...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...that you as President should now endorseanybody.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I guess you're right. HALDEMAN:Because, in the first place, if you say I...PRESIDENT:First of all, first...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) Haldeman and(unintelligible) Ehrlichman...PRESIDENT:What do I say about Mitchell?HALDEMAN:Then you lea...Well, what do you say aboutMitchell, what do you say about Dean?PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:There's a lot more suspicion on Dean now,are you gonna say you stand by me, but not by...APRIL 19, 1973,FROM 9:37 P.M. TO 9:53 P.M.12PRESIDENT:That's right, that's right. And if Is if Isay that, then Dean says, "What the hell,why don't I stand by him?"HALDEMAN:You could say, "I'm not gonna mention anynames, but I would caution any of you tocome to any conclusions about anyindividuals...PRESIDENT:Yeah, that's right. HALDEMAN:"...because there are a lot of those chargesin here as well as some valid ones...PRESIDENT:That's right, that's right. HALDEMAN:&#64257;...and until they are properly sorted out,it would be very wise for everybody to keephis mouth shut...PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...and, and his open mind.PRESIDENT:Right, right, right, right, right, right.That's good, Bob, that's good. Well, that's ah, this thing about this stuff and Hunt stuff that was carted up, I don't know whatnow...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) It's incredible. This ah,this thing is so frigging bizarre that it's,it's beyond...PRESIDENT:Yeah, but, but, but, you say Silbert, whatdoes he say about it, I, I didn't hear that...HALDEMAN:Well Ehrlichman has some story, I guess hegot from Colson, saying that it was this material was offered to Silbert at somepoint. They said they'd give it to him andhe said he didn't want it, and that puts him in a very sticky wicket now that it's known that it exists, so he has said this storythat this lawyer had it, ah that thislawyer's client had it for, for all through the summer, it's preposterous. It's kind ofa stupid thing for him to say. There'sAPRIL 19, 1973,FROM 9:37 P.M. TO 9:53 P.M.13HALDEMANCONT:no point in his saying anything. Heover-reacted, I guess, to this, and ah,lawyers may have told you when they talked with Silbert today, they said he was veryup-tight...PRESIDENT:mmmm. HALDEMAN:...and ah; very formal and... PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and obviously (unintelligible) harassed.(Unintelligible) know Silbert very well though, they know...PRESIDENT:But, but.Silbert, yeah, they've only met himonce. Does (Unintelligible) the, the, the law, ah, the lawyer says that he offered it to Silbert, is that the story?HALDEMAN:No, (unintelligible) Colson says, so Colsonobviously must know something about this and I think John, I, I didn't get the full fill on this 'cause John came in at the end ofthe meeting (unintelligible) and(unintelligible) in and, ah...PRESIDENT:Uh huh, Colson ah, se- that it was offeredto Silbert and...HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:It was contents of his safe? HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:His office.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) his office (unintelligible)safe obviously cause his safe they didn'tget in so, and it doesn't, they didn't, theysaid that things from his desk...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:From Hunt's desk. It was the next morning.See,APRIL 19, 1973,FROM 9:37 P.M. TO 9:53 P.M.14HALDEMANCONT:that could be Colson, who was worried aboutthe safe as I recall...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...too, who may have told somebody, youknow, "For heaven sake get over there and,and ah, do something."PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Well...PRESIDENT:Anyway...HALDEMAN:We gotta be careful not to draw conclusions. PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:You just really don't know.PRESIDENT:We don't know, that's right. HALDEMAN:And it would be awful unfair to somebodyby...PRESIDENT:That's right, I couldn't agree more.HALDEMAN:By skipping something. PRESIDENT:That's what, we're not going to do that.Well, it's ah, it's certainly, the difficultone here to figure out is Dean, isn't it?HALDEMAN:Yes, sir. PRESIDENT:God damn him, he's ah, I don't know what ah,what...HALDEMAN:He's totally distorted in his own mind nowand he, he...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...consequently I guess, very dangerous...PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 19, 1973,FROM 9:37 P.M. TO 9:53 P.M.15HALDEMAN:...But ah, sort of pathetic at the sametime.PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah trying to save himself.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) moorings and his, ah, youknow...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) saying anything.HALDEMAN:...swinging out in all kinds of ways. PRESIDENT:That's right. Okay. HALDEMAN:We'll just have to see.PRESIDENT:That's right, thank you.HALDEMAN:Okay.
