TO ?5PRESIDENT:They let him out just as soon as they foundout who they were, right?HALDEMAN:Should have missed (tape noise).PRESIDENT:(Tape Noise) The whole business aboutrepression and so forth, don't you thinkit's, on that side -- inci-incidentally, hasanybody thought, you know, I, I, I mean it may be that you guys went ahead (unintelligible), maybe it occurred to youthat, to, to put same of these guys in sp--why doesn't somebody introduce a resolution. If you can't get a resolution, perhapscircularize a letter supporting thePresident on the handling of the demonstrations. You know we -- or something like that.

(Tape Noise) The speeches don't doany damn...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) doHALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:Maybe a resolution. HALDEMAN:A resolution or a letter might. PRESIDENT:Maybe, maybe it isn't worth the bother. Ijust thought that it might,...HALDEMAN:...It might get them thinking about it. PRESIDENT:That's my point.HALDEMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:I think really that--... HALDEMAN:Even Sam Ervin got up and went, went througha big pretension of praising the, the, thewhole operation, Justice, theAdministration, the police. Everybody heardNIXON, HALDEMAN MEETING, MAY 5, 1971, 9:55 A.M. TO ?6PRESIDENT:That right?HALDEMAN:Yeah, he's the great defender ofconstitutional liberties and all...PRESIDENT:Yeah.

She said Mrs.Ervin, Mrs. Stennis came through the lineand she said, ''You know, the President has saved our country.''HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:They really think this is good. I mean, wemay have more goin' for us than we think here, Bob. Yah. We shouldn't be frightenedabout it. That's my point. Let me put itthis way, let me put it this way: I know, I know what it is that you're gonna run into on this. You're gonna run into people that-- the overreaction thing and all that sortof thing. My point, you're gonna get accustomed to that. No way that you'regonna avoid it.HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:So therefore, play it hard. Play itresponsibly, but play it hard and don't backoff from it.NIXON, HALDEMAN MEETING, MAY 5, 1971, 9:55 A.M. TO ?7Now, they can -- you see, they're all,they'll all think back to the San Josething, you know, and forgetting that SanJose was fine except for the God damned silly speech, you know. Covering thatgetaway from it, we got out (unintelligible)home free. We had it all on our side.HALDEMAN:Nobody's raised that analogy and I think-there's been no...PRESIDENT:Well.HALDEMAN:...thought of backing off. PRESIDENT:Don't back.HALDEMAN:It's been all, the whole line has been...PRESIDENT:...firm. HALDEMAN:Stay firm. PRESIDENT:Stay firm and get credit for it. That's mypoint. See, I don't want to make anaccident out of it. I don't want to be doing on the basis, well, we're sorta sitting here embattled and doing the best wecan. I think the idea here is to lead anoble -- you see maybe, you, it may be that we're setting an example, Bob, for, uh, foruniversities, for other cities, and so forthand so on. Right? (Tape Noise) Let 'em look here. These people try somethin', bust &#8218;em. (Unintelligible Noise) general attitude ofyour people.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Convinced?HALDEMAN:I think...PRESIDENT:...we ought to go forward. HALDEMAN:Yeah. We, we stay with that all the way.There's no--NIXON, HALDEMAN MEETING, MAY 5, 1971, 9:55 A.M. TO ?8PRESIDENT:In other words, let's beproud of what we'redoing, not that we're--I think Ziegler is&#8218;cause I...HALDEMAN:I think there're sane folks out there totear down the Vietcong flags today.PRESIDENT:Good.HALDEMAN:There'll be some confrontation on that inthe, in the Hill thing. That's, we're, we're trying for that. Would be good. And,uh, (tape noise) of the Vietcong flags.There's been some play. Newsweek ran somebig color stuff. I think they, I don'tthink realized that they were...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...doing them a disservice because I thinkthe Newsweek coverage hurt the demonstra--we have them--, cause they showed thisguerilla theatre, stuff with their faces all painted up and, and Vietcong flags and this kinda thing in color. Uh, very vivid colorpictures.PRESIDENT:Um-hmm. HALDEMAN:So...PRESIDENT:Hmm. You have &#8218;em on that (unintelligible)?HALDEMAN:Yeah, (unintelligible) Uh,... PRESIDENT:(Tape noise) take a look.

(Tape Noise) Unless somethin'happens the latter part the week, some new story, but, uh, they have to go pretty muchwith what's in by Wednesday.(unintelligible, tape noise) decision and I would think that might be the, might be the story.

HALDEMAN:(Tape noise) That's really what happened.It sure shows that, the effect of, uh, ofthe television barrage and was just all it can be.
