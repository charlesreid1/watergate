PRESIDENT:You know, the thing that you did and boy Iknow the agony that you went through. I putthe ear phones on, you see.HALDEMAN:Did ya? That's the way to do it. PRESIDENT:And I listened to every damn thing, and Bob,this son of a bitch is bluffing.HALDEMAN:Well sure. PRESIDENT:Also, we sent Buzhardt over, this -and this,is just for your private information...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:He went through the files and not a God damnmem con of the files.HALDEMAN:Really?PRESIDENT:None. Period. He didn't make any.JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.2HALDEMAN:I didn't see how there could be any thatwould, would matter 'cause you do not haveanything unless he made &#8218;um up.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well, he could make mem con's ofconversations, you see, but he didn't havethose either.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Unless he took them out. HALDEMAN:I'll be darned.PRESIDENT:And we don't think so. The other thing isthat throughout this thing you should be interested to note, he doesn't mention the350 until the twenty-first--HALDEMAN:I didn't think so. PRESIDENT:And he didn't mention, Ehr, Ehrlichman's uh,deal, with the, uh, Kalmbach &#8218;til thetwenty-first.HALDEMAN:I didn't think so. I thought... PRESIDENT:And also... HALDEMAN:...that came through on the twenty-first.(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:And also, -that was new -and also, he didmention the, the, the Krogh thing on aboutthe seventeenth.HALDEMAN:Oh, really. PRESIDENT:Yeah, but that's alright. You know hementioned that, uh,...HALDEMAN:Yeah.JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.3PRESIDENT:...that uh, uh, that was there and so forth,but only in passing as if it weren't a bigthing or so forth.HALDEMAN:Well, he must of mentioned that, uh, at someearlier point the, uh, the doctor's officebreak-in.PRESIDENT:That's what I mean. HALDEMAN:Yeah. Because it, it became sort ofapparent in the, in the, at the later pointthat he hadn't mentioned that earlier.PRESIDENT:Yeah. But that's it. I thought you shouldalso know that...HALDEMAN:Boy, that's great.PRESIDENT:...he said throughout this conversation that"nobody in the White House is involved." He said that, uh...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:..."Ehrlichman isn't, Haldeman isn't," youknow he kept, he said that on at least four occasions in this thing.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:I hit him straight on, you know at thatpoint.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:He said, "Nope, they're not." HALDEMAN:Well that's what he... PRESIDENT:The only,...HALDEMAN:...told me all alongJUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.4PRESIDENT:The only thing that he has in there, whichhe did hit about the seventeenth, or maybethe fourteenth, was that Strachan might be,uh,...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...involved in terms of getting material.HALDEMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:Only that. HALDEMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:But you know, what the hell was that, uh,uh, what the hell to make out of that. I didn't know what, uh, uh, th-that was trueor not.HALDEMAN:And that was a might. And, and, there'sthere's still doubt about that.PRESIDENT:um hmm.HALDEMAN:Well there still is.PRESIDENT:That's only, that's only his -uh, he didn'tindicate that Strachan knew about it in, in advance.HALDEMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:He only indicated that he had some, as heput it, the fruits of the investigation.HALDEMAN:Well, there's a question about that.PRESIDENT:But, but and be that as it may, I want youto be sure to tell John.HALDEMAN:Well, that's, that's gre...PRESIDENT:Both you and he, he just through out untilthe twenty-first, didn't say one damn word that,JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.5PRESIDENT:uh, indicated that, uh, either of--he(CONTINUED)mentioned that Ehrlichman's involved withsomething about the Chappaquiddick thing.And I, and there's nothing wrong with that.HALDEMAN:Huh.PRESIDENT:You know the Chappaquiddick thing.HALDEMAN:Well, that was with that Tony or something,huh?PRESIDENT:Huh?HALDEMAN:With that guy Tony?PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And, uh, so what the hell is that, that we-that an investigation was conducted. He says that's uh, problem for Ehrlichman, he said. That's a problem.HALDEMAN:Those are all, what he's talking aboutthere, are, are, uh...PRESIDENT:Have nothing with Watergate. HALDEMAN:Political embarrassment or, publicembarrassment, but not problems of anylegal...PRESIDENT:Nope, nope.HALDEMAN:...culpability.PRESIDENT:But, I thought you'd be interested, pleasedto know, that I, I went through this agony for eight hours, nine hours today. I didnothing else. Just damn near broke me down.But, you know how tough it is to listen to that stuff.JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.6HALDEMAN:Oh, it is, it's, it's, uh nerve-racking and,then, of course, I was trying to make notes,which, and you probably were too.PRESIDENT:I made notes all way through. HALDEMAN:It makes it even worse.PRESIDENT:The only thing I missed, that I, uh, hopeyou will do, I did not make, I did not pick the twenty-first conversation because I figured you ought to be the witness on that.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:I did not, uh, make notes on the twentysecond conversation, figuring that you,Ehrlichman and, were there, you know,HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...and that you would make notes on that. HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:So, you'll have to cover that if you will,and, and give us, give me, a little -you know, just for my own information, what the hell he said on those occasions. Twen yougot it? On, on the, uh, on the twentysecond. And the telephone calls from Key Biscayne I don't have because they don'thave those recorded. I called him twicefrom Key Biscayne and, uh,HALDEMAN:Yeah. But, that... PRESIDENT:But I think it was about McCord, but I don'tknow.JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.7HALDEMAN:I think, I think it probably was because,uh, uh, or it could have been on a lot ofother, que, sort of question things. Butthey were all on, they weren't on this subject at all.PRESIDENT:It could have been about Bittman. You know,I could have mentioned that to him.HALDEMAN:That's possible, yeah. PRESIDENT:And uh, but, suppose we did. You know, Isaid, "Well, listen, I understand Bittman'staking care of" or something, that's, that's a question of evidence. Right?HALDEMAN:Yeah, but that isn't likely. I can'timagine that, that you would of...PRESIDENT:I might of, no, no I might have mentionedthat because I was concerned about it youknow. About whether, uh, Bittman had, uh,HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...was gonna blow -not because of Watergate,because he was going to blow on, uh,HALDEMAN:...on the other project.PRESIDENT:Yes, that's right. But, uh, except forthose two conversations from Key Biscayne onthe twenty-third, I've got it all now, andthere ain't nothing there, believe me.HALDEMAN:Well... PRESIDENT:As far as,-basically, if you'd be interestedto know, on the twenty-seventh, the twentyeighth, uh, which I have the first and, uh, all the other conversations we had, Bob,they were about, every, usually, aboutExecutive Privilege, Gray...JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.8HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...getting the F, getting Sullivan to get ussome dope on the, uh, bugging.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Uh, things of that sort.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:But, there's not a God damn -he didn't,didn't ever mention the cover-up. Never.HALDEMAN:Well, I didn't think so, and, and, on thebasis of the, of the twenty-first, ya, youhave to assume that he hadn't because, uh, as I told you, it was so clear that this wasnew stuff.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:That, uh, I didn't see how he could havementioned it earlier.PRESIDENT:I'm going to have Moore make memos withregard to, what he talked to him about on the twentieth, I don't know what the hell he did talk to him about, but, I had aconversation with him on the twentieth thathad nothing to do with all this.HALDEMAN:Did you listen to those too?PRESIDENT:Hell yes.HALDEMAN:Good lord.JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.9PRESIDENT:I mentioned it so -I listened to every thingthere was, that we had available. But, but,the stuff the EOB doesn't come through. SoI haven't got that pretty well (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Oh, really.PRESIDENT:No. HALDEMAN:It doesn't, doesn't... PRESIDENT:NoHALDEMAN:...pick up.PRESIDENT:It's not clear. But, nevertheless, thepoint is that those conversations are alwaysones where you or John are both, were present, see.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:So you're the witnesses on that.HALDEMAN:Well, there were only a couple of them.PRESIDENT:Yeah, well, the Mitchell one and anotherone, apparently there was one -I didn't realize this, on the afternoon of thetwenty-first. Uh, did youHALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:What the hell was that all about?HALDEMAN:At 5:30, that was the one afterwards that hesaid, uh, bring, pull the wagons up around the White House.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:It was uh, uh,...JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.10PRESIDENT:Did he mention all this Bittman stuff?HALDEMAN:No, uh-uh.PRESIDENT:Hum.HALDEMAN:Not at all. Not at all. PRESIDENT:Shows ya, maybe whe--, the Bittman thing issomething that concerns us more than him.HALDEMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:Hum. But the point is that this whole jazz,to the effect that, or, -from Januarythroughout we a thirty-five meetings andtelephone calls in which it, we discussed the cover-up Bob, is totally false.HALDEMAN:Well, that's, I know that.PRESIDENT:Totally false. HALDEMAN:And I was sure of that from going throughthe log yesterday.PRESIDENT:And I wasn't sure, you know, until I hearit.HALDEMAN:Even. And then it just, it, it, it'sawfully good that you did. Alright what'reyou gonna do with that now, other than knowit.PRESIDENT:Well.HALDEMAN:Can't do anything.PRESIDENT:I can't do a thing except... HALDEMAN:...except that you (unintelligible).JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.11PRESIDENT:...reassure our own people and to know that,uh, we know what the hell the facts are.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And we're going to let him go out his stringa little further now. You what I mean.HALDEMAN:Yeah, right.PRESIDENT:Let's see what he does, I, I, don't youagree? Or do you?HALDEMAN:Sure, sure, 'Cause that, see that, that justdiscredits him all the more.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:And you get that story out of the thirtyfive meetings to, uh, on the cover-up, uh,that is just clearly not true. And, and if it's...PRESIDENT:The only possibility is that he...HALDEMAN:...you can prove it.PRESIDENT:He might have a telephone call from KeyBiscayne on the twenty-third. That's the only thing I can figure.HALDEMAN:That, that's after the investigation and,and...PRESIDENT:Um hum.HALDEMAN:...when you're into it, you're about to pullhim off of it or you know, you've got him going on. I can...PRESIDENT:But you were talking to him then. Weren'tyou, Bob?JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.12HALDEMAN:Darn right.PRESIDENT:What the hell was he talking about on thetwenty-third?HALDEMAN:I've got a lot of details on, on that. PRESIDENT:What'd he talk about?HALDEMAN:Oh, all kinds of stuff. The McCord, uh, theMcCord thing, and, and his, you know, just trying to sort it all out.PRESIDENT:Did he go into the Bittman thing with you onthose, on that occasion?HALDEMAN:No. Uh-uh. No, it never came up again. PRESIDENT:Hum.HALDEMAN:Except, you know, as a later, he referred toit as, as one of the examples of, of, uh, blackmail. That was on the twenty-sixth. He gave me a long spell out on the twenty sixthof a lot of his theories on things, whichwas after held been up there for a while and it was clear then...PRESIDENT:(Clears throat) If you could give me, uh,for my own private information, just yourown -and uh, just send it to me, you know &#64257;eyes only," -of your recollections of thetwenty-second, uh, and the afternoon of thetwenty-first, it would be helpful.HALDEMAN:Alright. There isn't very much, but I can. PRESIDENT:Huh?HALDEMAN:Uh, there's not much. I can't...PRESIDENT:Uh, just, just your recollection of what thehell it was.JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.13HALDEMAN:Ok.PRESIDENT:Anything that's really relevant to all thisthing.HALDEMAN:Ok. PRESIDENT:But, you and John should be uh, pleased toknow that there wasn't any God -there wasn'ta damn thing -except for the Strachan thing. He mentioned that. He did mention that on the thirteenth or fourteenth.HALDEMAN:Hum.PRESIDENT:About Strachan, he said, uh, was, uh, youknow, "possibly vulnerable," as he put it.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And that, that might make you possiblyvuln-, and I said "John, does that mean Haldeman knows." He said, "No." You know.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Flat out. HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:In fact, through the twenty-first, he saidyou were not, you and John were not involvedexcept in this tangential way, you know, John on this basis. As a matter of fact,the whole thing is, uh, one that shows thatthe fellow was not, uh, if anything, leveling with us about what the hell...HALDEMAN:That's a point.JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.14PRESIDENT:I mean, I, uh, -except he's let's -that hedid mention the, uh, the break in -on theseventeenth. He mentioned that. But that'swhen I first heard of it and I jumped out the chair virtually, said, "What the hell isthat all about." That's the first time Iheard about the break-in, you know.HALDEMAN:Whadda, you mean, uh, uh the doc, thepsychiatrist.PRESIDENT:Yes.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:But, that's alright. We covered that in ourstatement. I didn't say twenty-first. Isaid in March I learned about it, see.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Ok.HALDEMAN:Well, that's very interesting. I see yourfriend Cox is all excited now that he's...PRESIDENT:What, what's he saying now? HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I heard that he's take, takin' on Ervin.HALDEMAN:Well, he took on Ervin, on the, uh, -uh, hehad a press conference and called on Ervinto hold up for ninety days.PRESIDENT:Um hum. HALDEMAN:And Ervin and all the other Senators toldhim to go to hell.JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.15PRESIDENT:Um hmm.HALDEMAN:But, uh, uh, they also, apparently the, theWhite House was asked if, if you had a logthat showed whether you had these meetings with Dean and uh, uh, they said that, thatwould not be put out. You know that,that's...PRESIDENT:Well. HALDEMAN:...President's papers or something. Andthe, uh, Cox leaked out and said that, uh,he would of course get those papers. Held been promised access to all papers and, uh,that he would expect to have access to allpapers and there would be no, no, uh...PRESIDENT:Uh, we've got to stand firm on that, don'tyou think?HALDEMAN:So, uh, -I think so except, uh,...PRESIDENT:We could put the log out. HALDEMAN:Yeah, I'm not sure you'd, you, you have to-well, I don't know though.PRESIDENT:I don't want to put these pap, I don't wantto put the papers out though, basically because there's, you know, there's some veryfrank talk in there about what I think ofthe Supreme Court and a hell of a lot of other things. I don't want it out.HALDEMAN:Oh, yeah. You can't do that.PRESIDENT:What would you do?HALDEMAN:Well, it seems to me that -well of coursethey did, uh, see, -they say they won'trelease the log. I don't think you do wantto release your log, because that releases your, your private meetings and all that. I think what, what they've done is right,which is they said, they confirmed that youhad met with Dean a, a...JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.16PRESIDENT:Um hum.HALDEMAN:...a number of times during the,...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...this period. Uh, let's see, one of thethings Dean makes the point is you knowthat, the meeting started January first...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)... HALDEMAN:which is significant that they didn't starttill February 27th.PRESIDENT:Um hum.HALDEMAN:And uh, uh... PRESIDENT:Might put that out, huh?HALDEMAN:I just wonder if maybe it shouldn't bebetter characterized that there were a series of meetings, uh, uh, starting on the twenty-seventh, regarding ExecutivePrivilege and, and uh,...PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...uh, the, the questions of dealing withthe Senate hearings and (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:And no cover-up was ever discussed.HALDEMAN:...relating to your press conferences. Andthere was absolutely no discussion ofcover-up.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:At any time. PRESIDENT:Right.JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.17HALDEMAN:Uh, in any of those until--I think you couldsay until the meeting of the twenty-firstbecause you said in your, your, uh...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...first speech that on the twenty-first youreceived new information.PRESIDENT:I wondered if you would mind giving Ron acall and telling him that. Would you mind doing that?HALDEMAN:Ok.PRESIDENT:Fine, fine. But I, boy, if I never had aharder day in my life, you know, I've uh,HALDEMAN:(Laughs)PRESIDENT:You could do it, a younger guy -but I, I cansee how that you went through the agony on that twenty-first thing. Jesus, listening tothis crap is unbelievably tough. But it wasworth it. And as I said, Buzhardt spent the whole day in his files, just for your information. Didn't find one single damnmem com.HALDEMAN:Hum. PRESIDENT:Unless he's taken them out.HALDEMAN:Well, he may have...PRESIDENT:And Buzhar-no Buzhardt thinks he doesn't, hedoesn't think he made any because he checked other things that he's worked on. He has nomem coms on that.HALDEMAN:Yeah. Well, I didn't think he did.JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.18PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Told ya, he says he made a chronology at theend of each day.PRESIDENT:Ah... HALDEMAN:But, I think that's a lot of BS, just likeall the rest of that...PRESIDENT:He didn't find it. I mean, they didn't findany chronology in there.HALDEMAN:And if he did, there wouldn't be anything init.(NOISE) PRESIDENT:I...HALDEMAN:So, you know I, what difference does it makeif he does, did. In fact that it, it, it disserves his purpose to say he did make one, because it would...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...disprove his point. PRESIDENT:Some way or other I think his lawyer is theone that's, uh, moving...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:out here. I don't think Dean, strangelyenough, is, uh,...HALDEMAN:I think you&#8482;re right.PRESIDENT:I think his lawyer is out really sla-, Imean making flamboyant, uh, charges and so forth and they won't stand up.JUNE 4, 1973 FROM 10:05 TO 10:20 P.M.19HALDEMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:But let's let him get out a little limb, alittle bit more.HALDEMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:If you would call Ziegler on this otherpoint and say we ought to get that out,would you?HALDEMAN:Ok. PRESIDENT:Thanks, Bob.HALDEMAN:Yes sir.REEL END
