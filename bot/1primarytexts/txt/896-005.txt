TRANSCRIPT OF A RECORDING, OF A MEETINGAMONG THE PRESIDENT, H.R. HALDEMAN AND JOHNEHRLICHMAN. ON APRIL 14, 1973, AT 2:24 TO3:55 P.M.TRANSCRIPT OF A RECORDING, OF A MEETINGAMONG THE PRESIDENT, H.R. HALDEMAN AND JOHNEHRLICHMAN. ON APRIL 14, 1973, AT 2:24 TO3:55 P.M.(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:All finished? EHRLICHMAN:Yes air. All finished. He is an innocentman in his heart, and in his mind, and hedoes not intend to move off that position. he appreciated the message of, that, uh, good feeling between you and him.PRESIDENT:He got it, that, huh?EHRLICHMAN:And he appreciated my PRESIDENT:Why don't you give me your, uh-- How didyou, uh, get this little chapter and verseEHRLICHMAN:Well, I started out by saying that this wasa subject that was so difficult for you to talk to him personally about, that, you hadasked me to do this.PRESIDENT:And that you had made a study EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;that you had had me doing this. That I hadpresented you with a set of conclusions thatwere admittedly hearsay, but that pointed inthe direction of, uh, the, uh, of his exposure, and Jeb's, and other people, andthat you were having me systematically talkto these people because, in the course of this investigation, we had discovered a frame of mind on the part of some peoplethat they should stand mute in order to helpthe President, and that your sense was that the Presidency was not helped by that, andthat it was not my purpose to tell anybodywhat he should do, but only to tell him that as far as your view of the interests of the Presidency were concerned, that they werenot served by a person standing mute, forthat only, for that reason alone. Now, there might be plenty of reasons why a personwould want to stand mute and put thegovernment on its proof.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.2And that wasn't the question. And obviouslybe, And then be said, "Well, what you'resaying to me is that the President isreserving to me all my options," and I said, "Of course he is, John. The only thing thathe doesn't want you to feel is that youdon't have the option of going in and talking, if you want to do so. That you have completely every option to go in or notto go in.&#64258; And he said, well he appreciatedthat, but he had not been taking the position he had for the reason that hethought he was necessarily helping orhurting the Presidency, but he said, "You know, these, these characters pulled this thing off without my knowledge.&#64258; He said,"I never saw Liddy for months at a time.&#64258;And he said, "I didn't know what they were up to.&#64258; And he said, "Nobody was more surprised than I was. We had this meeting,and, and," uh, he, he lobbed, uh, mud ballsat the White House at every opportunity -it was very interesting how he dragged it in,uh, yeah...UNIDENTIFIED: EHRLICHMAN:...one after the other. But for instance,hesaid, uh, "There were these meetings,uh, uh, these characters came over to myoffice and, uh, Liddy put on this million dollar presentation which was perfectlyridiculous. Says it comes the origin ofthat, of course, was in the White House where Bob Haldeman and I talked about something called the Operation Sandwedge.That was really the grandfather of thiswhole thing. And, of course, that was never put together because we couldn't get theright people to do it, and -They weretalking about Joe Woods and people of that kind," and so he said "It never happened."PRESIDENT:What is Operation Sandwedge?HALDEMAN:It's, it was something that Jack CaulfieldAPRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.3PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Oh, yes.HALDEMAN:...came up with back in 171, and we-neededsome intelligence and ought to set up ourown Intertel.EHRLICHMAN:So then he went on to say that, uh,, uh, uh,there were only those meetings he's stillhung up on the only three, uh, only three meetings thing. He made it very clear to me that he didn't ever believe there was afourth meeting. He said that, of courseHALDEMAN:He wasn't in the fourth meeting, John.There were only three meetings as far ashe's concerned.EHRLICHMAN:No, no, but he didn't refer to three orfour, he referred to the, the meetings themselves. He, he argues that there was nomeeting after the million dollar meeting,let me put it that way.HALDEMAN:Oh, really. EHRLICHMAN:Right. That's the sense of what he wassaying. I didn't press him on it and I triedto play him with kid gloves. In fact, I never asked him to tell me anything.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:He just came forward with all this stuff. PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Uh, he says that, uh, uh, actually, uh,Magruder is going to have a problem with allthis because Dean talked Magruder into saying the wrong thing to the Grand Jury,and, uh, uh, so Magruder's got a problem.PRESIDENT:My God, Mitchell was there EHRLICHMAN:Yep.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.4PRESIDENT:Isn&#8482;t that the meeting they're referring to?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir.HALDEMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:Mitchell was there when Dean talked him intosaying the wrong things?HALDEMAN:That's what he says. That's what the,that's what Mitchell says.PRESIDENT:What does Dean say about it? EHRLICHMAN:Dean, uhDean says it was Mitchell andMagruder who agreed.HALDEMAN:Well, uh, - EHRLICHMAN:It must have been the quietest meeting inhistory because everybody's version is thatthe other two guys talked.PRESIDENT:Go ahead. Let's hear the rest of 1t. EHRLICHMAN:Well, it goes on like that. Uh, his, hischaracterization of all this is that he wasa very busy man, that he wasn't keeping track of what was going on at the Committee, that this was engendered as a result of Huntand Liddy coming to Colson's office andgetting Colson to make a phone call to, uh, Magruder and that, uh, he, Mitchell, wasjust not aware that all that happened until,uh, Van Shunway brought Liddy into Mitchell's office sometime in June, and that's the first he had knowledge of it.Much later in the conversation,HALDEMAN:Before the discovery? EHRLICHMAN:Uh, well, I don't know.(Unintelligible)APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.5EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. He didn't, he didn't(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:You can listen to it. I've got it taped.(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:But in any event, much later, uh, I saidthat the Grand Jury felt, or the U.S.Attorney felt, that they had John, uh, wired. And he said, &#64257;Well, what possible evidence could they have to, uh, feel thatway?" And IPRESIDENT:John Dean or John Mitchell? EHRLICHMAN:John Mitchell. And I said, "Well, Iunderstand that one version of the facts-isthat Magruder brought you a memo with a number of targets on it, and that you checked off the targets that you wanted."And he said, Why, that, nothing could befurther from. truth than that.PRESIDENT:That was John Dean's version? HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:That's what he said he said to Mitchell?EHRLICHMAN:Right. Then'-- HALDEMAN:What Mitchell said to me was that he did nothe said, "I checked, I signed off on it."PRESIDENT:Yeah. Go ahead. HALDEMAN:I said, "You mean you initialed it," and hesaid, "No.&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:Then, uh, I said, uh, they had res jestae byHunt and Liddy having a conversation, and Liddy saying to Hunt, "Yes, I know how youdon't like this stuff. We have to do itbecause Mr. Mitchell insists on it.&#64258; He said, "I never saw Liddy for five months. From February toAPRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.6June, I never laid eyes on him."' He said, "Ithink Liddy is the source of a lot of myproblem here, he's using my name, and soforth.&#64258; Uh, so it's very much of a hard linething. He said, uh, uh, "If I'm Indicted, itis gonna be very hard, but," lie said (Clears Throat) "I have to think of my reputation.&#64258;Uh, he said, "I can't let people get away withthis kind of thing," and he said, "I am justgoing to have to defend myself every way Ican.&#64258; "Because," he said, "Obviously I can'tget a, I can't get a fair trial in the city ofWashington by any stretch of the imagination. We'll just have to see how that all comesout.&#64258; Uh, he said, "I an sorry to hear thatso much of this is going to come to the WhiteHouse.&#64258; Uh he said, uh, "Certainly it's notin the President's interest to have all thiskind of thing come out.&#64258; He made a greatpoint of the $350,000. He says that hisrecollection -and he said, "You want to checkthis because," He said, "I'm not, I'm very vague on the facts of this.&#64258; But he said, I,uh, uh, I, I told him about Strachan, becauseStrachan used to work for him. And I told himthat Strachan had been, and has to go back andcorrect from 350 to 328. Well, he said, "Thatwasn't the only invasion of that money.&#64258; AndI said, "Oh?&#64258; And he said, "No, you would have to check with John Dean on this but," hesaid, "it's my recollection that Dean hadStrachan draw other money out of that fund forpayment to these defendants.&#64258; And I said,"Well, that's the first I heard of that. Iunderstood that Strachan had gone to Bob andsaid what about this fund, and Bob said sendit back to the Committee and, uh, thatStrachan had taken it to LaRue as a representative of the Committee.&#64258; He said,"Yes, I think that's the way it all went, butnot until some of it had been tapped for thedefendants.&#64258; And I said, uh, uh,...HALDEMAN:(Coughing) I think your defense is, it was notknown to anybody over here who was gonna,whoever received it.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.7EHRLICHMAN:No. I said (tapping) "Was that before themoney got to LaRue?&#64258; And he said, "Yes, Iam sure it was.&#64258; And I said, &#64257;Well, whowould know about that cause I've never heard that before?&#64258; And he said, "Well. I thinkDean.&#64258; So --PRESIDENT: The $328,000 is wrong, too, them? EHRLICHMAN:Well, if Mitchell is to be believed, that'sright, uh, that&#8482;s the inference. But, uh,you don't know of any-other withdrawal doyou, Bob?HALDEMAN:Well, I told youEHRLICHMAN:Yep.HALDEMAN:...the $328,000 was not returned in onetrip.EHRLICHMAN:But it all went to LaRue?HALDEMAN:That's what I'm told.PRESIDENT:...In one trip? I mean he did it twice? UNIDENTIFIED:Yep. HALDEMAN:Here, here's the sequence on that. Wewanted to get the money back to theCommittee. The Committee wouldn't take it. Mitchell wouldn&#8482;t let LaRue take it. I saidgive it all back. LaRue, Mitchell said no.Then they got desperate for money, and being desperate for money took back -I think it was $40,000. And that's all they wouldtake. I still said, "Take it all back, notjust, not just, not just a segment of it&#64258;, and made, uh, the point that I didn't seewhat the problem was. If they needed moneyand we wanted to get rid of money, it seemed to me it was of mutual interest in working it out. And that, then, was what happened.The balance -If, if $40,000-were taken inone trip then whatever -(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Tell Strachan in his testimony on Mondaythat he better be, he better be clear thathe didn't give it all in one bunch.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.8HALDEMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:Right, 'cause Strachan has testifiedapparently that he gave the whole bundle atonce.HALDEMAN:No, sir, he has not.EHRLICHMAN:No, he wasn't asked that.PRESIDENT:He wasn't asked? HALDEMAN:His testimony in that area is not wrong. PRESIDENT:Good.EHRLICHMAN:Now, John kept referring to, kept using aphrase, protecting the rights of people." One of the ways that he used that phrase wasin response to myquestion-about what hethought I oughta do with the information that I had collected in the last several weeks.(Unintelligible)And he said, uh, &#64257;Well, you have to first ofall consider the rights of the individual." I said, "Yes. At the same time, here is thePresident sitting here now with a body ofhearsay and not absolute knowledge. Uh, my inclination is to give it to Kleindienst."And, uh, he thought about that awhile and hesaid, "Yes, I guess that's, that's the best thing he could do."I said) "Now you should know that Kleindienst just said that if you,in any way, get the crack in this case, thathe is going to step aside, regardless of this whole case." And I said, "I understandHenry Pre, Petersen also will."HALDEMAN:Really? EHRLICHMAN:And, yeah, HALDEMAN:I think you've got to be kidding.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.9EHRLICHMAN:...and, uh, I said "That the thingKleindienst is pushing for is a specialprosecutor.&#64258; John said, "That would be agrave mistake because it would be subversive to the orderly process of justice ifeverytime you have an important case youstrive to put together an ad hoc process."PRESIDENT:Well, how ridiculous-the presentprosecutor's going like hell anyway.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, so, uh, I said, uh, "At least, hethought he should step aside.&#64258; He got a very wry smile on his face, and he said,"Well it&#8482;s great to have friends isn't it?&#64258;He says, "Especially the way that we stuck by them&#64258; -- meaning the ITT business, I assume.PRESIDENT:Because of Kleindienst.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, so, uh, that was a, that was aninteresting little aside. He said, "I Would be very grateful if you would all kind ofkeep me posted."'HALDEMAIN:Really? EHRLICHMAN:And I said, "Fine.&#64258; He knew that we weretalking to Chappie Rose. Uh, I told him nodecision had been made about a Special Counsel, but that we were inclined not to appoint a Special Prosecutor; that youwere...PRESIDENT:He doesn't mind a Special Counsel? EHRLICHMAN:And, he thinks it's a good idea to have aSpecial Counsel. He suggested that maybethe Special Counsel should be the one to go talk to Kleindienst, rather than, uh, somebody from the White House staff. And,uh, uh, so that, that was his only reactionto that. Uh, I told him again that I thought he ought to be represented, and thatPaul O'Brien was now a target of this GrandJury and that I thought he really had to think about gettingAPRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.10representation. He said he had given it alot of thought, but that be, uh, didn'tthink that he would want to make a changeyet. He thought he would wait and see how O'Brien got along. Uh...HALDEMAN:Which confirms he considers O'Brien to behis attorney?EHRLICHMAN:Right. HALDEMAN:That's interesting.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, (tapping), he asked me how he wasinvolved, in, in, what I had heard about the prosecutor's view of Mitchell's involvementin the obstruction of justice suit. I saidthat f really had not been able to find anybody who was an efficient actor, who really went to a defendant and said, "Don'ttalk," or so and so. And he said, "Well, I,I really wonder if you ever will, other than their lawyers, because, uh, my impression of this is that they were the ones who wereworried about their fees and who were reallycoming to us rather than for any of us going to them to bring about a change intestimony. Matter of fact," he said,HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) &#8211; all along EHRLICHMAN:"the thing that, uh, that we were talking toDean about," he said, "I wasn't reallyworried about what they testified to. I wasworried about what they'd say to the press."HALDEMAN:Exactly when Hunt made the challenge.EHRLICHMAN:Yep.HALDEMAN:That, somehow, Dean doesn't see that, thatway.EHRLICHMAN:Well, we've got to talk to him some more.Uh, he, uh, he, Mitchell, did not mentionMartha at all, or and I didn't raise it. That was just not even in the conversation.UNIDENTIFIED:(Coughing) Yeah.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.11EHRLICHMAN: Uh, Oh, I told him that, uh, the only waythat I knew that he was mentioned, insofaras the aftermath was concerned, was thatfrom time to time he would send Dean over saying, "Hey, we need money for this," andhe said, uh, &#64257;Who told you that?"HALDEMAN:John Dean. EHRLICHMAN:And I said, "John that's, that's. that'scommon knowledge. And, uh, Dean, amongothers has told me that.&#64258; Uh, I said, &#64257;Deanhas not been subpoenaed. He has not testified and, as a matter of fact, the waythey are proceeding down there, it lookslike they are losing interest in him."(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:I, in a sense, well said this to Johnbecause I wanted him to be impressed withthe fact that, uh, uh, we were not jobbing him.PRESIDENT:Oh, I get it, the point. Yeah. Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:We were -Dean (unintelligible). That's it.PRESIDENT:Does he know that Magruder's going toconfess?EHRLICHMAN:I said that in-the course of calling toinvite people to come talk with me today, and I indicated that there were more than two, that the person who called was toldthat Dean intended to, uh --PRESIDENT:Magruder. EHRLICHMAN:Pardon me, er,er, Magruder intended to makea clean breast of it and that, that wasfirst party information and very reliable, and that that would tend to begin to unravel this thing from the center -in bothdirections. And he agreed with that. Nowhe said, which version is it that Magruder is going to testify to? Is it the one thathe gave Bob and me in Bob's office, or is itsome other version?"APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.12HALDEMAN:That's not true.EHRLICHMAN:I saidPRESIDENT:What was the version he gave Bob? Was itanother version?EHRLICHMAN:Well, he let me tell you what Mitchell said.It was another gigging of the White House.Uh, he said, uh, uh, "You know, uh, in Bob's office, Magruder said that Haldeman had cooked this whole thing up over here in theWhite House and, uhPRESIDENT:Had he said that? EHRLICHMAN:Well, I mean, that's, you know, the sort ofPRESIDENT:All right.ERRLICHMAN:And that, uh, uh and that sort of PRESIDENT:Now wait a minute. Your conversation withMitchell is the one where, uhHALDEMAN:I've got the notes somewhere.PRESIDENT:...where Mitchell (unintelligible) is onehere Mitchell falls down on (unintelligible). Very good. It's good youhave it too, but, uhEHRLICHMAN:Mitchell's theory PRESIDENT:Wait a minute, whatever his theory is, letme say a footnoteEHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:&#8211;one, one footnote is, uh, that, uh, his,uh, throwing it off on the White House isn'tgoing to help him one damn bit.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, uh, unless he can, unless he can peddlethe theory that Colson and others wereeffectively running the Committee throughMagruder and freezing him out of the operation,APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.13PRESIDENT:Hum.EHRLICHMAN:... which, is kind of the story line he wasgiving me.HALDEMAN:Did he include me in the others? EHRLICHMAN:Yep.HALDEMAN:That I was freezing him out of theoperation?EHRLICHMAN:That you, in other words, he didn't say thisbaldly or flatly, but you accumulated awhole, uh, a whole bunch of things, and it'sColson, Dean and Bob(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:...working with Magruder, and uh, that thatwas sort of the way the line up went.PRESIDENT:The fault is the, White House's rather thanhis.HALDEMAN:He's got an impossible problem with that.PRESIDENT:Well, I&#8211; HALDEMAN:The poor guy is putting PRESIDENT:It's bad if he gets up there and says that,It's a hell of a problem, for us. HALDEMAN:It's a Problem for us. No question. But there's no way he can prove itEHRLICHMAN:He has a very, very bad tremor.PRESIDENT:He's always had that. EHRLICHMAN:Well, I've never noticed PRESIDENT:Shakes.EHRLICHMAN:... it as bad as this.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.14HALDEMAN:It's always been bad.PRESIDENT:You've done your, uh, done your duty today.(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:The next question is, EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...the next question is whether you seeMagruder or not and you're now set to see him at 4 o'clock, and if we're going to cancel him, we should do it right now.EHRLICHMAN:see no purpose in seeing him.PRESIDENT: Why, because Magruder's, uh, Magruder'saware of the fact now that we -HALDEMAN:Magruder's already going to do what John'sgoing to tell him to do, soPRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:So far, we've got it allPRESIDENT:Our purpose of course, uh (unintelligible)do it. Our purpose, as I understood it -what I mean Bob, was to keep a record for the (unintelligible).EHRLICHHAN:All right. For that purpose maybe I should.Now, maybe what I should do -HALDEMAN:Let him tell you what be told me, and thenyou say, "Good.EHRLICHMAN:Exactly. PRESIDLNT:I'd like to get, I'd like to get what thehell he's, uh, what he's going to say.EHRLICHMAN:All right. All right.PRESIDENT:I would particularly like to get what thehell he's going to say about Strachan.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.15EHRLICHMAN:All right.PRESIDENT:I mean, I'd say, apparently, uh, you couldsay, "Look John, look Jeb, I have to conductthis investigation on the White House. (Unintelligible).&#64258; If he says Strachanknew, say how do you know he knows?EHRLICHMAN:All right. PRESIDENT:Do you think you should ask him that or doyou not want to go digging. I that?HALDEMAN:Why not?EHRLICHHAN:Okay. (Tapping) PRESIDENT:All right.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah-Once he tell me that be, that heintends to go forward to tell the truth, he has nothing to lose by talking to me.PRESIDENT:Hell. Well, I know. The point is that Iwant it to seem you want him to be, withoutguiding him or leading him, you can at least maybe get that out.EHRLICHMAN:Right.HALDEMAN:Well, his lawyer will be there.EHRLICHAN:Right. PRESIDENT:The other thing is what about the, whatabout the, uh, of course, you realize thatif he says something about Strachan, then, of course', that puts an obligation on us to do something about Strachan doesn't it?EHRLICHMAN:Well, at least to corroborate it or, or, uh,investigate it, or, or go forward on it.HALDEMAN:You could do it by questioning Strachan?EHRLICHMAN:Among other things.HALDEMAN:Here's where it ends up.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.16EHRLICHMAN:Well, if it ends up that way, why then youhave a sort of a dog fight. Now, letPRESIDENT:Excuse me go ahead, sorryHALDEMAN:I didn't Think, Jeb is, let me put it, letme say this, I don't think Jeb wants to hangStrachan. I think Jeb is worried about thefact that in going through this, he is going to, to, he thinks, to a degree, implicate Strachan. Now, that's the same kind ofthinking as Strachan and Chapin, who wereboth very concerned about getting me into the Segretti thing. In other words, theythey see any involvement, any mentioning ofthe name as being a problem.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:I don't think Jeb sees it or understands thequestion of whether he really got Strachanin or not, and I'm not sure how far he decided he intends to go with, with Strachan.EHRLICHMAN:He didn't say, he didn't really make itclear?HALDEMAN:No. He just said, unfortunately, this wholething is going to come up and if it comes upPRESIDENT:Bob HALDEMAN:... but then, what's, what's the problemwith Gordon? And he said, "Well, I don'tknow. That depends on what other peoplesay."PRESIDENT:Other people, meaning like a secretary, youmean, or somebody who typedHALDEMAN:Could be. PRESIDENT:...typed a memorandum. HALDEMAN:Could be.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.17PRESIDENT: To a degree, I think I see in Strachan'scase the, well, the other possibility, ofcourse, would be, uh, may be they're verylikely, oh, I think it night be this Bob, that, uh, they're gonna ask the question,Who told you to do this Jeb, Mr. Magruder?&#64258;(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:He's flatly denied that Strachan told him todo it. Now, Larry did, Larry did, hebrought back that exact story that he, thathe --PRESIDENT:Colson. What about the Colson(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Uh, he says that he's going, going to haveto hurt Mitchell.HALDEMAN:He says, "The one I'm going to hurt isMitchell, and to some degree, John Dean andmaybe Gordon."PRESIDENT:He's obviously talked this through. Isn'tit worthwhile for you to find out, uh,HALDEMAN:I think we have to,PRESIDENT:...I think we owe it to ourselves to findout about John Dean, for example, what he,now understand, that he thinks(unintelligible) this is true (unintelligible)...us.EHRLICHMAN:All right. I think that's right. This isprobably a golden opportunity in a way.PRESIDENT:Right. To find, well, let me put it thisway. We've got to find out what the hellhe's gonna sayEHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...so that we'll know what to expect, youseeEHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...rather than have the God damned thing goon our heads.EHRLICHMAN:Right.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.18PRESIDENT:The interesting thing is, uh, did, did, didBob tell you are you, uh, prepared to saythat he says that, uh, he, uh, Magruder,said that they'll Indict him and not Mitchell. That's a hard damn theory. Isn'tthat what you told me? Bob, didn't you tellme that?HALDEMAN:No. No. He said everybody, no, he said"Everybody is going to fall an this.&#64258; Hewasn't meaning indictments. He was meaninggonna talk.PRESIDENT:Oh.HALDEMAN:Himself, LaRue and so on.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:He said everybody's, everybody&#8482;s going todrop except John. And, he's gonna get outof it. (Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:That's correct. That's correct. HALDEMAN:He didn't mean that, that Mitchell wouldn'tbe indicted. He meant that Mitchell,Mitchell was the only one who was going tocontinue to hardline, that everybody else had given up. And that's why he's given up.His point is, his keeping quiet now or lyingnow serves no purposecause all they're gonna do is get him on a perjury count as well as everything else. If he can clean upanything he can live with himself better. He's faced the fact that he's had it. (Pause)PRESIDENT:Uh huh, so that means LaRue and O'Brien. Isthat right?HALDEMANDepends on how far they go. EHRLICHMAN:That's right.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.19PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Jeb doesn't know anything much about that.PRESIDENT:it's under cover. They'll push him.I thinkhe can put up a pretty goad fight on the thing, don't you?HALDEMAN:I would think so. I, I would be, uh --PRESIDENT:Even if they indict him, it's going to be adamn hard, hard, intricate case to prove. You've got to prove motive there, don't you,John?EHRLICHHAN:Yes. Dean, (Clears Throat) Dean argues thatin a, in a conspiracy, uh, such as they&#8482;retrying to build, they may not have to provethe same kind of animus as to some of the participants, but only that they were, that they were in it. Uh, I, I would have toread the cases. I Just don't know what thelaw is.PRESIDENT:Of course, you've got their, you&#8482;ve gottheir defendants the same way, I guess, uh,HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:.. I guess, uh, that key witness there isHunt.EHRLICHMAN:Well, the defendants, and then it's, uh, thedefendant's lawyer, Bittman.PRESIDENT:Hunt and Bittman. They're both, Hunt willtestify tomorrow.EHRLICHMAN:My, my guess is that a fellow like Bittmanhas probably negotiated immunity for himself, and hasHALDEMAN:Dean strongly feels they wouldn't give it tohim.EHRLICHHAN:Yeah, I know. PRESIDENT:They will?APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.20HALDEMAN:Will not.EHRLICHMAN:But that, uh, he's gonna, he's gonna tellabout a lot of conversations he had with alot of people.PRESIDENT:Bittman is?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Do we know that? EHRLICHMAN:Well, I don't know that, but I know forinstance, that Bittman had a conversationwith Colson that was a Watergateconversation. And, uh, uh, I know, I know what Colson says about it -that he wasbrilliant and adroit, avoided anyHALDEMAN:And he says Bittman s recollection of itwould be exactly the salve as Colson's his recollection of the of the specificconversation but he says Bittman may drawconclusions from it.PRESIDENT:This is the clemency conversation? HALDEMAN:Yep.(Pause)PRESIDENT:And his conclusion would be that he felt thePresident offered clemency?HALDEMAN:No. Hisconclusion is that, that, he, he,uh, Colsonwill have Hunt out by Christmas, because you knowwhat kind, what kind of pull I have here in the WhiteHouse. I'll be able to work it out. That'swhat he would, would imply ~y saying --PRESIDENT:What, how does Colson handle that?EHRLICHMAN:He says he's got a tape or a wire, uh; uh, amemo orsomething that says exactly what he said.HALDEMAN:It's just a memo. He wrote a, he wrote amemorandum of the conversation immediatelyafter the conversation. Which will, that's all it is, is his side of the story.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.21PRESIDENT:You don't think this, this would lead to anindictment of Colson do you?EHRLICHMAN:(Sighs) I haven't any idea. Dean seems tothink everybody in the place is going to get indicted. (Laughs) No, this afternoon Well,IHALDEMAN:They&#8482;re all doing the same thing. What Deansaid is just looking at the worst possible side of the coin that you could make a listof everybody who In some way is technicallyindictable in the cover-up operation. And that list includes, in addition to Mitchell,Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Colson, Dean,PRESIDENT:Because they all discussed it? HALDEMAN:Strachan, Kalmbach, Kalmbach's go-between.Kalmbach's source, LaRue, Mardian, O'Brien,Parkinson,EHRLICHMAN:Bittman HALDEMAN:Bittman, Hunt, uh, and, and, you know, so,and just to keep wandering through theimpossibles, he said maybe the route for,for everybody on that list to take a guilty plea and, and get immediate, uh, uh, what doyou call it, pardon, or, uh,PRESIDENT:Clemency. HALDEMAN:clemency PRESIDENT:From the President.HALDEMAN:Hmm. That shows you-the somewhat incredibleway unclear-state (Laughs) of some of John Dean's analytical thinking.EHRLICHMAN:No way.PRESIDENT:It's a shame. There could be clemency inthis case and at the proper time, having in-mind theAPRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.22extraordinary sentences of ' Magruder, andso forth and so on, but you know damnwell...HALDEHAN:It's gotta be down the road PRESIDENT:It's ridiculous. They all know that.Colson knew that. I mean when you talked toColson and he talked to me.EHRLICHMAN:The, uh, Magruder thing is 4 o'clock andit's still on.HALDEMAN:Yeah. I think I have to go confirm itEHRLICHMAN:All right. HALDEMAN:Should I?EHRLICHMAN:I think so. It's an opportunity Now thequestion is whether I ought to get a hold of Kleindienst for, say 5 o'clock and get this thing all wrapped up.PRESIDENT:Have you determined it should be Kleindienstrather than Silbert?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Dean's right about that. I'm sure. PRESIDENT:I didn't know you'd talked to Dean.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I did, I asked Dean's advice on this.He said Silbert would ask you to wait a minute, he'd step out of the room, he'd comeback to get you and he'd walk you right intothe Grand Jury.PRESIDENT:Oh. EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, he, he doesn't dare handle acommunication like that personally, from thestandpoint of the later criticism. He says the better route would be to go toKleindienst, who will probably step asideand refer you to the Dean. The Dean, in turn, would say to Henry Petersen, "They'd done this little investigation over at theWhite House, they've collected a bunch ofhearsay, there doesn't seem to be much new, but they've got itAPRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.23There for anybody who wants it.&#64258; Petersen,-in-turn, would inform Silbert, who would,thank God, I got more than I can handle herenow, we'll wait and Interview that guy later."PRESIDENT:The purpose in doing this is what? (Sighs)EHRLICHMAN:The purpose of doing it is to PRESIDENT:The White House conducted its investigationand turned it over to the Grand Jury.EHRLICHMAN:Turned it over to the, to the JusticeDepartment.PRESIDENT:Before the indictment?EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:How much are you going to tell them? EHRLICHHAN:I, I think I'd let 'em drag it out of me ina way. I don't know, I just really haven'tthought that part through.PRESIDENT:Because they would say, "Why did the WhiteHouse wait for the Justice Department to do all this?"EHRLICHMAN:"Did the White House know?&#64258; is probably theway this would come. YesPRESIDENT:Yes. And you'd say, yes, as a matter offactEHRLICHMAN:We had, we had been at work on this for sometime. The President, the PresidentPRESIDENT:...President ordered an independentinvestigation.EHRLICHMAN:...needed it known. PRESIDENT:I had ordered an independent investigationat the time McCord had something to say.Right.EHRLICHMAN:All right.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.24PRESIDENT:At that time, you conducted aninvestigation.EHRLICHMAN:And that a, at the time, I was ready toreport to you my tentative conclusions, and they were no more than that, you felt thatthey were sufficiently serious that, uh,well that, you felt that one overriding aspect of the report was that some people evidently were hanging back feeling thatthey were somehow doing the President afavor. That the President had me personally transmit to them his view that this ought tobe a complete open thing; that may or maynot have played some part in Jeb Magruder's subsequent disclosures to the Grand Jury. In any event, uh, uh, rather than for ussimply to hold the information that we didhave in the White House, we turned it over to the Justice Department for whatever disposition they wanted to make of it.(Pause)PRESIDENT:If Mitchell is indicted here, you think he'sgoing to be convicted?EHRILICHMAN:Yeah, I think so. I can't guarantee it, butI would be amazed once, once Magruder goes in there.PRESIDENT:But, that's only one man.EHRLICHMAN:Ah, that's plenty.PRESIDENT:Is it? EHRLICHMAN:Oh, yes sir, and uh, wellPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) know criminal law?EHRLICHMAN:With all the other stuff they've got, uh, PRESIDENT:All the other stuff they've got? EHRLICHMAN:... they have a way of corroborating, uh --APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.25PRESIDENT:All right. So let's go down the road.Mitchell's indicted, when do you think thisis going to happen? With Magruder going intoday, it could come sooner.EHRLICHMAN:Could be. Could be,although Dean feels itwill not be before May 15th,, at theearliest, and now with the glut of people coming In, it may be later than that, could be toward the end of *-* #PRESIDENT:Because they want to makeEHRLICHMAN:They will want to do it all at once.(Pause)STEWARD:Yes, air?PRESIDENT:I'll have consomme. Thank you. ERRLICHMAN:I might have Dick and Joe came over at 5o'clock.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And tell them what we've done, tell themthat I will reduce the report (Clears Throat) to, to typewriting, which it is notnow.HALDEMAN:He could probably be over sooner if youwanted. He's at his lawyer's office.EHRLICHMAN:Why don't we do it as soon as we can?HALDEMAN:3:30? EHRLICHMAN:No sense sitting around here. PRESIDENT:Make it 3:30.EHRLICHMAN:Seems like we always have a drum on the lawnwhen these things are going on. We had a band out there when Hickel came in.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.26HALDEMAN:Oh, really? Uh, would you, uh, check Jeb andsee if they, why not have h1m, come aver andsee us here.EHRLICHMAN:Yes air. PRESIDENT:What is the situation then with Mitchell?Undoubtedly, he will change the venue(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:If he could come at 3:30, that would bebetter here.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'd think he'd have maybe a betterchance of getting it judged in a different venue, uh (Noises in Background) concerningthe witnesses, than he would certainly herein Washington who would feel the political heat of letting the Senate go on. I, I don't know how to calculate that. That'suh, it's a good question. But, I mean,you'd have to have it in a place like Missoula, Montana.PRESIDENT:This is a national story. EMAN:(Unintelligible) Gee, Pascagoula,Mississippi, might be better.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, that would be better. (Pause) Miamiwould be the place, best place for it.PRESIDENT:With you here, you men and Dean, and withoutgoing as far as, uh, as we did a month ago, and so forth and so on, he said they will,uh, probably indict a pretty big bag.HALDEMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:Is that right?HALDEMAN:Could. Now he does not think he does, hisopinion is that they will not reach him.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.27PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:He does not think he's a target and hedoesn't think he will be. He thinks hemight be, but he doesn't think he will and if he's not, it doesn't go any ., that, thatmeans it isn't going any further than theWhite House.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'm not so sure you can say, uh HALDEMAN:That's right. He said they may be afterbigger targets.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. The name, names are kind of pealingoff, uh, uh,PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) like Ehrlichman andHaldeman?EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;like yours truly. PRESIDENT:Yep.HALDEMAN:I don't, I think, I thinkEHRLICHMAN:I don't HALDEMAN:...he's trying to get attention with that,John. IEHRLICHMAN:He got it.HALDEMAN:I don't think he believes it. EHRLICHMAN:(Laughs)PRESIDENT:I don't think though, I can't see that.John Dean had said we all got to keep our thinking perspective with John, Kleindienst a but tangential uh, anything, relationshipeither of you had with the God damned thingis nothing compared to Dean's because he sat in on the God damn meetings.HALDEMAN:That's right.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.28PRESIDENT:He did participate directly in the thing.EHRLICHMAN;Oh I'm certain, there&#8482;s an element ofHALDEMAN:As, as, however, and if he, he can, uh -he'son a somewhat higher level admittedly, but he can establish himself in a similar roleto that of Strachan, say that he was merelya messenger, a conduit, agent.EHRLICHMAN:Boy, Mitchell. HALDEMAN:...he's not a principalEHIRLICHMAN:Mitchell sure doesn't agree with that. He'dbe a tough I assume Mitchell will never testify. That, that would be my assumption.That, uhHALDEMAN:Well, one thing I was thinking of that wedidn't talk through, but I'm sure you thought through and I have talked to him andtold him I was reporting to the President,is that, that the outcome of the Magruder thing is that there will never be any public Magruder testimony.EHRLICHHAN:That's right.HALDEMAN:So the question of what Magruder's testimonyamountsEHRLICHMAN:Well, noHALDEMAN:...to is only in terms of what the GrandJury isEHRLICHMAN:No, that's not right, Bob. Because he will,he'll be indicted, he'll plead guilty, he'llbe sentenced.HALDEMAN:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:Then he's available.HALDEMAN:To the Committee? EHRLICHMAN:Well, to, to the Committee or to the Courtas a witness in somebody else's case.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.29PRESIDENT:Oh, he is?EHRLICHMAN:Sure. He'll be brought back in his prisondenims, changed into a business suit and beput on the stand.PRESIDENT:Oh.HALDEMAN:Really?EHRLICHMAN:Sure. HALDEHAN:Why doesn't he take the Fifth on possibleadditional self-incrimination?EHRLICHMAN:...they'd give him immunity.(Noise)HALDEMAN:Sounds nice for awhile, anyway. This stuffwasn't hanging on any of those thingsanyway.EHRLICHMAN:No. No. HALDEMAN:I think we just go to face that fact that whatever the story in it's going to be out(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Well, you'll have the entire story out, plusprobably two other stories that two otherguys make up.HALDEMAN:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:And that anything and everything that's saidwill be believed.HALDEMAN:And at least one of which will be enormouslydamaging to us.EHRLICHMAN:There would be no wayHALDEMAN:Not provable, but damagingAPRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.30EHRLICHMAN:...no way to deny it.PRESIDENT:It's terrible when they get such a big bag.EHRLICHMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:What does all this mean with regard to the,our posture here. Would you say let's takethe gas? In terms of not, not, notcooperating with the Committee and so forth. You're not going to, you're now looking at another month of it.HALDEMAN:I don't think we should take that chance.PRESIDENT:See if we can in a month or more. I don'twanta, I don't wanta, Bob, you see the pointis I don't wanta cooperate with theCommittee unless I get a resolution of the entire Republican Caucus in the Senate. We can't do that. (Unintelligible) based onthe (unintelligible). Do you not agree?(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Look, what, what should I say to Ervin andBaker on Monday?PRESIDENT:That's exactly why I am raising this point.(Unintelligible with Noise)EHRLICHMAN:One thing,HALDEMAN...the lawyer's office...okay(On Phone):EHRLICHMAN:I think Magruder and Mitchell and others, PRESIDENT:If they show up at the SenateEHRLICHMAN:...will not be witnesses at the Ervinhearings.PRESIDENT:You just, you just told me (unintelligible)that they could be witnesses at that trial.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.31EHRLICHMAN:Well, they can, but the, the point is thatthe, the, well, alright, after, after thetrial, after their trial and theirsentencing,PRESIDENT:Yeah. Of Mitchell.EHRLICHMAN:... they, they could be subpoenaed,PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:... and they would be delivered up to theCommittee.PRESIDENT:But why, oh, you mean until Mitchell istried, they can't be, uhEHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Why?EHRLICHMAN:Until they stand trial, well, uh, it wouldprejudice their rights.PRESIDENT:Not only they, but he's already given,, pledguilty.EHRLICHMAN:Ah. Well then, then Magruder could be awitness after he's, after he's been sentenced. If he wanted to be and, uh,PRESIDENT:Wanted to be?EHRLICHMAN:Now, here&#8482;s the, here's the tricky point.Whether or not Ervin can grant immunity tosomeone who has been sentenced and isserving a sentence is something that I don't know, whether that would make any difference or not. I have no doubt that a judge can,but I don't know whether the Senate can.. Ithink Ervin's best bet is to suspend as soon as these indictments are announced. I mean that's if he were smart, that's what he'ddo, and just let this thing tear everything up, and then come around afterwards and touch up places that have been missed. Justsort of go around the battlefield and getthe coup de grace.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.32PRESIDENT:Well, after they get through this, this kindof indictment, there isn't going to bethat-much gas in the Ervin Committee. Imean, they'll go ahead, but I mean they'll say well, now, what the hell, there's oldSegretti, shit he's too' small.(Unintelligible) On the other hand, peopleEHRLICHMAN:He gets the leavings. PRESIDENT:What?EHRLICHMAN:He gets the leavings. That's all.HALDEMAN:They'll delve into it because their, theirwhole pitch is that this isn't theWatergate, it's the use of, the misuse ofmoney and all that sort of stuff.PRESIDENT:I Know, but HALDEMAN:They're going to run that money game down.Where did it come fromEHRLICHMAN:Yeah. HALDEMAN:... where did it go? EHRLICHMAN:Mitchell, said, incidentallyPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) million dollars?HALDEMAN:Well, yeah. EHRLICHMAN:... Mitchell said that, uh, uh, we shouldtake great care to establish that threefifty came from the pre-'72 campaign money.HALDEMAN:Right. EHRLICHMAN:And, "Questions in your mind about that?&#64258;And he said, "No. My impression is thatthis is where it came from," but he said, "Maury Stans and Herb Kalmbach spent a weektogether trying toAPRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.33tie all these various funds down as tosource and that's a big loose end."PRESIDENT:Well, you better, let's get that one. Well,there was no question about that, was there, Bob?HALDEMAN:Not in my mind.EHRLICHMAN:Well, but you see Maury and Herb HALDEMAN:The question was that, there was, well a lotmore than that the question was how much ofit would we set aside. It came down tothree fifty.EHRLICHMAN:MauryPRESIDENT:Who brought it over here? Maury?HALDEMAN:No. Gordon Strachan went over there and gotit. Well, either Sloan brought it over here or Strachan went over there. I'm not surewhich. Strachan took delivery from Sloan.PRESIDENT:We heard this one before the campaignstarted, in other wordsHALDEMAN:It was April sixth.PRESIDENT:April sixth?EHRLICHMAN:That may make a problem. PRESIDENT:After the day of the,HALDEMAN:The day before the seventhPRESIDENT:It was April seventh? But it was the nightbefore.HALDEMAN:Yeah, it was cash that had been, John (unintelligible) -ed over from the seventh.EHRLICHMAN:But John Implied that they had biggerproblems and that they had to use this moneyto make up shortages some place else orsome--, I don'tAPRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.34know. He didn't get into all this, but hesaidHALDEMAN:They never told me that.EHRLICHMAN:They had problems with making theiraccountings all come out even, Kalmbach andStans.HALDEMAN:Kalmbach assured-me all the time that thetack, the cash from '70 was intact, except forsome that, that, uh, we knew had been used.But, uh what was intact was, there wassupposedly about two million. What was intactwas about a million six and, uh, thequestion--it was way more than three fifty in other words, many times that--and the questionwas how much of that million six, and theyconvinced me that you, you don't want very,you don't want a million six. or it could havebeen restored to two million (unintelligible)but you don't want that because under the newlaws and everything, there is no way that youcould find to spend it.There isn't that muchstuff you can spend on that wouldn't be traceable. And, uh, so somehow figure ofthree fifty was negotiated as being reasonablefigure that might be, you know, would coverwhat might come up, but, uh, wouldn't beImpossible and wouldn't put that big a hole inthe campaign. So it was (Pause) so it was nogo. That was money that was not reallyPRESIDENT:Didn't belong to the Committee?HALDEMAN:Belonged to the Committee. Whathappened-really is that, that. We made acontribution to the Committee, that, thatPRESIDENT:Yeah, That's what it was.HALDEMAN:...the friends of Nixon in seventyEHRLICHMAN:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...made a million three contribution to theCommittee and kept three fifty of what it had of, of its carry over funds.EHRLICHMAN:That's, that's the way to argue that.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.35HALDEMAN:That's the way it wasPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) finish it, if you got time,finish it. It's all there. We'll talkanother time. I think Bob, that uhHALDEMAN:We can't reach Magruder. There's no answer.(Unintelligible) He might be walking over orsomething. If he arrives here, they'll let us know.PRESIDENT:Uh, we better get the other things out ofthe way. (Beginning of Reel Two) Uh, I thinkwe're going to be, uh, I don't want to be hammered into those hearings. I mean I don'twant to, I don't want to, I know, I know thehearings will all the hell on us anyway but I don't want (unintellible), but I don't (unintelligible). (First Reel Ends) What isinvolved here. Uh, we'll take I think we'lltake a hell of a beating (unintelligible) what is involved hereEHRLICHMAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:in the next thirty days, a lots, heat; we'lltake with regard to uh, why we aren't appearing, why we are not going to appearbefore the Committee. Now, how do we answerthat? We answer that by saying the Committee won't agree to our, the proper ground rules? Is that correct?EHRLICHMAN:We say we don't want to turn it into acircus. We want, we want our testimony received in a judicious and probitive way.We are willing to have our people go, butonly under the right circumstances.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.36PRESIDENT:Well.HALDEMAN:You get it by the Kissinger thing forreleasing the record of your negotiationsdown channel.EHRLICHHAN:Yep.HALDEMAN:Simply say that this is what we offer.EHRLICHMAN:Yep. HALDEMAN:We stand ready to meet this offer wheneverthe enemy is willing to talk.EHRLICHMAN:Seriously.PRESIDENT:Then the question would then arise. HALDEMAN:Tell 'em we'll resume the bombingPRESIDENT:(Laughter) uhEHRLICHMAN:I think it will PRESIDENTProbably not? EHRLICHMAN:Probably-not in the light of, the heat fromhe Grand Jury and so on.HALDEMAN:I still think you can PRESIDENT:If we have HALDEMAN:Maybe it can't be done, but there ought tobe a way to turn the Grand Jury thingstrongly in our way, which is that this, this proves the rightness of the President'sapproach of full cooperation with the properprocess of justiceEHRLICHHAN:Yep. HALDEMAN:which is bringing people, even at the veryhighest level, to account.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.37PRESIDENT:You were cooperating.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. I think we should do that.HALDEMAN:We've been cooperating all along.EHRLICHMAN:No question about that. ' HALDEMAN:And, and the value of that is(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) the first man out shouldnot be favored (unintelligible). You understand the importance of that and soforth and so on. Then I've got the(unintelligible) if you can get it to them. Trying to think of-how to use youeffectively in this too, John, is a -EHRLICHMAN:I have to be, uh, I have to be unwilling totell the press what I discovered because of the rights of individuals.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Unless we want to get Mitchell and Magruderoff. I could sure as hell give them an iron clad defense.PRESIDENT:Oh. Oh, I meant the Gray hearing.HALDEMAN:What's wrong with that? PRESIDENT:It's time the Grand Jury has indicted, uh(unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:No, I could, I could prejudice PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:...I could prejudice their rights in such away that they could...PRESIDENT:Oh. EHRLICHMAN:...never get a fair trial.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.38PRESIDENT:I guess you're right. You can't do it.See, Bob, that's the problem, you can do(unintelligible) cooperate with the GrandJury (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Well, how about if IPRESIDENT:It's wrong.HALDEMAN:Uhat's wrong with prejudicing their rights? EHRLICHMAN:Well, I don't-know. Uh,uh. How about if Iwere to do this.HALDEMAN:You get your indictment, but you don't getanybody in jail.EHRLICHMAN:I could say that I made a report. I couldsay that I made a deal. I could say that youinstructed me to do certain things. One of the things you instructed me to do was talk to Magruder. Another thing you instructedme to do was to talk to the AttorneyGeneral. And I did all those things.PRESIDENT:And you did, but not Mitchell. EHRLICHMAN:And then I wouldn&#8482;t mention who else. Icould say I talked to other people.PRESIDENT:I did you talk to Mr. Mitchell, Mr.Ehrlichman?"EHRLICHMAN:I,I,I am not gonna get into any other namesof any people.HALDEMAN:"Then why did you name Mr. Magruder?" PRESIDENT:'Cause he's testifying. That's the onlydifference. I don't know. You always comeup with what not to do to those people.HALDEMAN:Yeah.EHRLICHHAN:Yeah, right.PRESIDENT:Does (unintelligible) know Bob, uh, the uhAren't we really sort of, sort of uh, in aAPRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.39position where we'd better know who'sfalling abort in that dam Grand Jury. Imean, at least, pull the wire on somethingthere. I man, I really think you do. I mean, uh, they're (unintelligible). Itseems to me that a hell of a lot of theissue about do something involves out inability to convey the fact that we're willing to cooperate. That we're willing towaive executive privilege and keeping ourpeople silent. Now that's what I'm really trying to do (unintelligible) ... I don'tknow.EHRLICHMAN:We will get HALDEMAN:I&#8482;ve always heard that that's the right,that that's the point that kind of argument.PRESIDENT:Is that (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) one day, one day plusstory, uh.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:The price for which is, uh, weeks of chaPRESIDENT:Disaster. HALDEMAN:Disaster.EHRLICHMAN:But the thing that's wrong with that iswhile it's a one day plus story, it&#8482;s also the elimination of ninety days of negative stories.PRESIDENT:... before you ever get there. That's thepoint.HALDEMAN:And it's setting up ninety days of othernegative, more negative stories.EHRLICHMAN:Well, maybe. Maybe. Uh. That's a verygood question.PRESIDENT:The question is bow much more negative isthere.EHRLICHMAN:You could haveAPRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.40PRESIDENT:Then have the Senators go out andcharacterize it and all that crap.EHRLICHMAN:You c- You could have peace with honor if wecould get them to agree, as I believe they will, that executive privelege is reservedtill the tine of questioning. (Pause)HALDEMAN:They've pretty much stipulated that, haven'tthey?EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:What do you mean reserved till the time ?EHRLICHHAN:I mean - PRESIDENT:Negotiated?EHRLICHHAN:No.HALDEMAN:You got all these privileges regarding theindividual questionEHRLICHMAN:Right.HALDEMAN:... you only waive privilege as toappearance.EHRLICHMAN:Right. HALDEMAN:But you also appear, adhere the merits ofeach individual question as to whether itrelates to privilege or not and ask you what you want question by question. It will beby your representative accompanying thewitness. (38 second pause) And Connally's happy dream that I go up there charging away at the Senate doesn't work.PRESIDENT: I think Henry has a good point here tooand, and uh, the thought about it is, he doesn't want Bob to be the first witness andif there is anAPRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.41overrule and the cause was empty it makessense. Although, let me say I do thinkthat, uh, we still ought to consider are westill considering the possibility of getting out the, uh, Segretti story?EHRLICHMAN:Yes. Uh.PRESIDENT:No way we could do it? EHRLICHMAN:I think, I think getting out the Haldemanstory would be more useful in the light ofMagruder and others going down to testify.PRESIDENT:In other words you'd get that out beforethey testify?EHRLICHMAN:If possible.PRESIDENT:Before they get (unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:Yep, yeah. HALDEMAN:The beat purview story you'd get out wouldbe a White House story.PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:About how we've been working at this. HALDEMAN:Which meets Henry's objections. Well, it'sthe Haldeman story, but you can't do itother than the whole thing. I&#8482;ts theEHRLICHMAN:You say to Haldeman I have investigated.Packaged up the whole (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:What I can do is, basically, just having anEhrlichman report. You can (unintelligible) some of the Dean report. Uh, that would be(unintelligible) an Ehrlichman report thathe makes and here is the situation with regard to the White House involvement. Ihaven't gone into the Committee thing. NowAPRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.42EHRLICHMAN:The current charges, the current charges onWhite House involvement primarily areHaldeman charges.PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:Well, I didn't go into White Houseinvolvement. I assumed thatPRESIDENT:No. I EHRLICHMAN:...that what you needed to know from me, andI mean this would be what I would say, uh,"What the President needed to know was the,uh, truth or falsity of charges that were leaking out with regard to...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...uh, Committee for the Re-electionpersonnel and, any connections to the White House that might exist."PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:"That was the area of Inquiry rather thanwhether anybody in the White House was involvedPRESIDENT:I agree.EHRLICHMAN:...in the first place.&#64258; PRESIDENT:I've been trying to get you out there in away that you'd never go into all that stuffacross the streetEHRLICHMAN:I know. I understand. I understand. PRESIDENT:...other than the fact that you are going togo before the indictments.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'd do it before. The Indictments andsay, look, we have great confidence in theGrand Jury processAPRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.43PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:...and I don't want to do anything that isgoing to in any way impair that process.PRESIDENT:That's right. A number of people have beencalled before that Grand Jury, and I'm notgonnaEHRLICHMAN:The the, uh - HALDEMAN:I'd say everything I've found has beenturned over to the Justice Department,EHRLICHMAN:Exactly.HALDEMAN:Relating to that, PRESIDENT:... everything that the Grand Jury isconsidering.EHRLICHMAN:And I doubt seriously that I discoveredanything new. What I probably did was simply bring into the White House for thefirst time a body of information thatotherwise was available. (Noise) Other people, other investigators undoubtedly could do the same thing that I did and maybea lot better. But we had had no occasion,previously, to bring all that information before us. 'Uh, I talked to Kleindienst, soI got what the what the Justice Departmenthad. I got, uh, stuff from all over and we brought it in and we tried to assemble it in a way that, uh, was meaningful for thePresident, and, uhHALDEMAN:Did you review the FBI files? EHRLICHMAN:No.HALDEMAN:Why not? That's the original source you saidwas the most extensive investigation in history. Why the hell didn't you look at it?EHRLICHMAN:I didn't look at it because I didn't need tolook at it. I got a summary.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.44PRESIDENT:Dean was working the summary.EHRLICHMAN:No, and, and, uh, the Justice Department.PRESIDENT:Yeah, go ahead.EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, uh PRESIDENT:I think that's easy enough (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:I do too.EHRLICHMAN:I didn't, I didn't try and duplicate thework of the U.S. Attorney. Uh, what 1, what I tried to do was simply determine forthe, to the, to the Pre, for the President'suse and for the President's use only whether or not there was substance to charges thatwe were hearing, and whether or not therewas White House involvement with relation to those charges and to determine whether or not the White House ought to be doinganything about its own personnel or aboutothers that it was not doing. We were not trying to determine what the U.S. Attorney should do or the Grand Jury should do or theJustice Department should do. At the sametime it (unintelligible) for us to withhold anything from the Justice Department in the,with the thought that some of thisinformation might not have been previously available to them. So, uh, I'm not gonna go into it. I'm not going to tell you what Ifound.PRESIDENT:Well, but here&#8482;s the Haldeman story that wefound.EHRLICHMAN:But no, uh, uh. I'm not going to tell youspecifically what I found because obviously, uh, the the purpose of my work was simply for the President to form judgments as, asthe basis for the President to formjudgments with regard to, uh, uh, White House personnel and other governmentpersonnel, and uh, to determine whether ornot the White House was actually in any way impeding the progress ofAPRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.45the prosecutorial (Burp) effort Excuse me byanything that we were inadvertently doing.And, uh, so that's, uh, not that's not veryfancy and I'd want to think that through and try toPRESIDENT:So what I'm, what Vin trying to get is howyou get his story out. That's what I'm (unintelligible).EHRTICHMAN:Oh. I see. I just put that out just flatput that out. And do it hang it on the pegof the Ervin Committee setting a date for their first day of hearings.PRESIDENT:You mean you'd ask for an early date?EHRLICHMAN:No. They will, they will HALDEMAN:...they will announce Wednesday, EHRLICHMAN:...they will Wednesday, announce it.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...their hearing schedule. PRESIDENT:...and then, then Haldeman will make hisstatementEHRLICHHAN:Haldeman makes his statement and says, wellI have been sitting here waiting for a chance to be heard. We obvious now thatit&#8482;s going to be umpty-ump days beforePRESIDENT:We make an arrangement. EHRLICHMAN:Well, first of May is the earliest. HALDEMAN:When they start.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. And they, then your there will be sixwitnessesHALDEMAN:And think what, then when they hear McCordand six witnessesEHRLICHMAN:Yeah.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.46HALDEMAN:...before that, before us.EHRLICHMAN:No, he could say it now looks like it willbe several months before I would get achance to be heard before the Ervin Committee at best, and so, I'd like to makea statement at this time going Into a numberof charges that have beenPRESIDENT:...that have been bandied about, EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:Then you the way I would handle that, Iwould say, "Now let's take the Segretti matter", -uh, no "First, let's takeWatergate.&#64258; You say, "I had no knowledge,etc., etc., etc., etc.&#64258; Uh. "Let's take the Segretti thing. Now, here are the facts.&#64258; Uh. Then I would point out to(unintelligible) point out (unintelligible)self-incrimination (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:No. EHRLICHMAN:Well, we don't know that.HALDEMAN:Huh?PRESIDENT:Okay, John. Then you can go down withSegretti?HALDEMAN:Well, our view is clearly established, whichis uh, totally supported, that, that, uh, Segretti, Segretti's instructions were that he was to do nothing illegal.EHRLICHMAN:And, uh theHALDEMAN:And, uh, well in answer to the question howcould you launch a guy outPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...(unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.47HALDEMAN:That's one of the reasons that they that,the, his being a lawyer wasPRESIDENT:Now, now here's what's in thatHALDEMAN:looked into. PRESIDENT:...(unintelligible) uh, and, uh, third,there are charges of money, of, of, of moneywith cash (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:I have a whole list of the general charges. PRESIDENT:Well, the point is on the money thing(unintelligible) than that, I'd, I'd say itsays here, "The money, uh, yes, there was $350,000 left over from the campaign in1970. Uh, it, uh, it was delivered to theWhite HouseHALDEMAN:You see that ties to the same fund thatKalmbach see you get a question, how could Iauthorize the expenditure of funds forSegretti?PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Well, I've already established in theSegretti thing that Kalmbach had these fundsleft over for the campaign and that's what I would assume he would use.PRESIDENT:Right. Right.HALDEMAN:He was the custodian in spite of the fact, PRESIDENT:...that, uh, these funds, these funds were,uh, were made available for private pollingand so forth and so on. "They were usedonly for, uh $28,000 was used for $22,000 for ad, advertising and the balance of 500and 328 was returned to...HALDEMAN:They get very excited about that advertisingmoney; as soon as they find that out, they are going to track that down. And that, wehave a rocky gun zone.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.48PRESIDENT:Is it Vietnam?HALDEMAN:It was "Tell it to Hanoi".EHRLICHMAN:HmphHALDEMAN:It was a "Tell it to Hanoi" ad counteringVietnam, anti-Vietnam veterans.PRESIDENT:Was that it?HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Wasn't (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:That's good.HALDEMAN:It went to Baroody which was the turn out EHRLICHMAN:Bill or another Baroody?HALDEMAN:No, Sam or Charlie or something.EHRLICHMAN:Sam. HALDEMAN:It's not Edgar or smebody. One of theothers.PRESIDENT:That was the "Tell it to Hanoi? ads.HALDEMAN:Whatever it was, it wasn't I was scared todeath it might be something.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:A Colson ad but it wasn't. At least that'swhat Gordon thinks.EHRLICHMAN:Mitchell kept lobbing out little tidbitsabout Colson's operationPRESIDENT:Hmmm.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.49EHRLICHMAN:...about sending rioters up to the Capitolsteps and other things that he knew about.PRESIDENT:Well, that was separate from all ofMitchell's stuff, though, wasn't it? What Colson did?EHRLICHMAN:Well, he was, he was saying it's, it&#8482;sreally too bad that all this is coming out because there's so much sordid stuff that would be, that will be imputed to the WhiteHouse.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) not still sending riotersto the Capitol steps. What do you mean?HALDEMAN:They weren't rioters for heavens sake.PRESIDENT:Well, they named 'em counter demonstrators.Why do youEHRLICHMAN:Don't tell me, tell, tell it to, to JohnMitchell. (Laughs)HALDEMAN:I don't think anybody, even Chuck Colson,can tell (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:The point is that is the (unintelligible).My thought with Bob's, though, is true, isnot to make the countercharge in his in this.EHRLICHMAN:That's right.'PRESIDENT:I think he should save that for theCommittee. Now do you agree with that, Bob?HALDEMAN:I don't know. It's weakPRESIDENT:I'll even go as far asHALDEMAN:...it's weak if I don't. PRESIDENT:Yeah. You've got to sayHALDEMAN:I think I've got to make it in I don't meanmake itAPRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.50PRESIDENT:Put it in general terms, but hold, hold thewhite paper.HALDEMAN:I say (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Hold the white paper. HALDEMAN:... cite some examples and say, "All thesewere done by the others," but I hold off onthe thing that I have requested the Committee to look into, and when I&#8482;m up there I can say it's a matter of fact, youknow, there's a (unintelligible) said that,that there -PRESIDENT:I do feel that we should get this ready andreally bounce it and I think that's the dayto do it and slap 'er up there, and I'd sayHALDEMAN:It's ready. Oh, no, it isn't ready but it'sclose. But it's sure awful long.PRESIDENT:Will it be all right?HALDEMAN:I'm not so sure that matters. PRESIDENT:Perfectly all right to me. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) the d(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:And if it says if the Committee doesn't, Icannot allow, uh, I cannot allow thereputation of the (unintelligible), I meanthe, the, uh, effectiveness as an Assistant to the President will be seriously damaged.&#64258; "Eroded, uh, by, by false charges and soforth and consequently I am making thisstatement now. I will make this statement under oath. Report that I will make thisstatement under oath and answer questionsunder oath when the Ervin Committee finally gets around to hearing me.&#64258; How's that sound to you, John?EHRLICHHAN:Sounds pretty good.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.51PRESIDENT:All right. Mow I think I will say I willpoint out (unintelligible) my thoughts "I donot suggest that, uh, "I have only tried tocover in this statement questions of charges that have been made to date. That's whatI've said and it has not been, and, uh, andI am sure that others will be made. And I am prepared to answer those as well."HALDEMAN:"But I can't possibly anticipate what they&#64258;PRESIDENT:"I cannot anticipate them. I do not, uh, Icannot anticipate them, but I'd be prepared to answer them.&#64258; He won't thereby haveanswered through me questions of Watergate.'Now now the only question you have left is, I suppose, sort of the peripheral, in fact, uh Dean rumbling around here and asking youand Haldeman, "How about getting us somemoney for Watergate defendants?&#64258; God damn. I can't believe it. I can't believe they'd put you in the for conspiracy if you wereasked for that. Maybe they could.HALDEMAN:I technically, I'm sure they could.Practically, it just seems awfully remote,but maybe that's just wishful thinking.PRESIDENT:Incidentally, could Strachan be, find itvery helpful for him to say what that twenty-two thousand dollars was for beforethe Grand Jury? Why not?EHRLICHMAN:He will have to. I can't imagine that theywouldPRESIDENT:Well, they haven't asked him yet.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah but they will. Because PRESIDENT:$22,000 in (unintelligible). HALDEMAN:That makes sense.PRESIDENT:To be sure did you tell him(unintelligible)? Huh?HALDEMAN:Yeah.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.52PRESIDENT:Yeah, let's be sure. Well, you could say,uh, (unintelligible), if it wasn't my (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I probably better get up and get set up forJeb.HALDEMAN:Let me ask you if this there's that thingthere's something else,Gordon?PRESIDENT:Gordon? HALDEMAN:...that I'm supposed to ask Gordon?EHRLICHMAN:...that it was delivered in pieces?HALDEMAN:Oh, yeah.(Pause)PRESIDENT:There was forty thousand dollars in one occasion. (Banging) why did he deliver it because actually it was it was a large, uh, that's a large amount of money.EHRLICHMAN:No, they've already got him on that.PRESIDENT:Oh, is that correct? EHRLICHMAN:But it all fit in a suitcase or somethingand (unintelligible) of support(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:The reason 14 delivered in pieces wasbecause there was difficult for themobviously that, uh to figure out how toreceive back all this cash.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:And they requested that it not bePRESIDENT:Requested it in two Installments?HALDEMAN:...all at once. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.53HALDEMAN:Then delivered part of it at the time theyasked for it, and the balance at the timethey asked for it. My interest wasdelivering all of it as quickly as possible. I don&#8482;t know what their problem was.PRESIDENT:Could I just make the suggestion ofMagruder, first, get everything you can from him, Uh.HALDEMAN:He&#8482;s bringing two lawyers with him.EHRLICHMAN:Naturally. What'll we'll, what we'll doPRESIDENT:(UNINTELLIGIBLE) HALDEMAN:Probably one Jewish and one Gentile.(Laughs)PRESIDENT:Well, you know Jeb, I Mean, I don't knowwhat, w1hat about (unintelligible) they Strachan, but they want Dean. Right?HALDEMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:Just trying to get the facts and that's allthere is to it.EHRLICHMAN:I'll get back to youPRESIDENT:Be sure you convey my warm sentiments.EHRLICHMAN:Right.(21 second pause) (Sound of door closing)HALDEMAN:I think I ought to get Strachrin squaredaway.PRESIDENT:Sure. HALDEMAN:He covers.PRESIDENT:Wall, we'll see what they finally come downto here (unintelligible). I, I frankly think frankly, frankly I should say I don&#8482;tknow, but based on what Ehrlichman tells meabout the law it's a matter of withholding, evidence, as far as that was concerned. That was Mitchell's point and the matter ofmotive doesn't seem to be important.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.54HALDEMAN:Well the only sticky wicket on that is Dean.I can't understand because, 'cause -in hisinterest too, as well as everyone else's, tosee the motive for what it was. (27 second pause)PRESIDENT:I guess we're not surprised at Mitchell, arewe?HALDEMAN:No. It's partly true. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:What he's saying is partly t-rue. I don'tthink he did put it together.PRESIDENT:Hmh. He shouldn't he shouldn't throw theburden over here, Bob, on you. Now,frankly, Colson I understand, but, cause Colson certainly put the heat on over there. I don't think John would seriously havebelieved that you put them up to this thing.HALDEMAN:I told you I didn't. He knows I didn't.(Unintelligible). No question of that.PRESIDENT:I should think he knows it. He-let it allhappen himself. (20 second pause) (bangingon desk to beat of music) So he saw more, huh?HALDEMAN:That's what he says.PRESIDENT:You know he'll never he'll never go toprison. (20 second pause) What do you think about that as, a possible thing does a trialof the former Attorney General of the UnitedStates bug you? This God damn case.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)(18 second pause)PRESIDENT:He'll have to take the stand at some points.(Unintelligible) hell this has happened now.APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.55HALDEMAN:That's exactly the point. He's got nodefense witness that can deny it.(54 second pause)PRESIDENT:You know in one sense, Bob, it's better to(unintelligible) a couple of these smallthings but it's much better to hand it tothe Grand Jury. McCord may move on the theory that Mitchell will be sorry and the others too (unintelligible) that they havethe damn, the damn thing and the ErvinCommittee gets credit in the Watergate thing?HALDEMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:I don't know. Am I, am I seeing somethinggood developHALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:...that really isn't good or am I?HALDEMAN:No, No. That's, that was the thing I wastrying to get at this morning. That, uh, what that proves is the President's, in myview, is that the President's course wasright. The President wasn't covering up. The President was cooperating with theproper place and the proper place has cometo the proper result, which is to find out in an orderly manner without tarring innocent people, to find out what's goingon.PRESIDENT:You know the thing I was thinking of saying,I went around, uh, that's always the case ofthings here in Washington. Uh, MayorWashington kind of' stared, was surprised, wondered why you kidded-about nine lives. I tried to make conversation with him and soforth, damn it.RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;APRIL 14,1973 FROM 2:24 TO 3:55 P.M.56HALDEMAN:PRESIDENT:HALDEMAN:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;PRESIDENT:HALDEMAN:PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible/REMOVED) impossible.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible/REMOVED).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible/REMOVED) can you finish thisoff (unintelligible/REMOVED).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible/REMOVED) okay.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible/REMOVED)
