HALDEMAN:There's a need from, uh, a public viewpointto, uh, sort of make the, pull the WhiteHouse together I think, make things lookbetter -look like they're...PRESIDENT:Like we're right.

But,uh,...PRESIDENT:Well, there was, uh, feeler made a long timeago where everybody could come back, you know, under some -I don't know what it wasabout. Probably Congressional, thisCongressional thing.HALDEMAN:Yeah, I talked to him.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Well, let's set himself up for, uh, officeand not -even if there were...PRESIDENT:Well, I must say Haig handled himselfyesterday.HALDEMAN:He called me yesterday morning and said, uh,he said, "I've got to go out, I've got to go public today.&#64258; And I said, "Well that'syour first mistake.&#64258; And he laughed and hesays, "I agree, but I, this is a commitment I made a long time ago and it would lookworse to cancel it, uh now," and stuff. Uh,said, "If you have any guidance on anything you want me to say, let me know.&#64258; But he said, "Here is -here is my position.&#64258; Thenhe laid out that, "What I'm gonna say isthat President -I have full confidence in the President's...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.5PRESIDENT:...Sure, he had (unintelligible) and allthat.HALDEMAN:And, uh he said, "I don't think I should sayanything more than that.&#64258; And I said, "I think you'reabsolutely right." And hesays, "These bastards are trying to divideus. They're trying, uh, to push us in and the same people who have always been against us like the Brooks and Schweikers and(unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:Um hum. HALDEMAN:&#64257; ...we still have a problem with, and, ofcourse, the press."PRESIDENT:Yes. HALDEMAN:He says, "I think we&#8482;ve just got to, uh,'til the President moves an-an-and when hemoves, we got to support that track positionall the way and nothing else and not go beyond it."PRESIDENT:That's right, Bob.HALDEMAN:Goodness, that's great. (Unintelligible)going out today. Uh, the, uh, media clamor -you know, I, I don't know I, I was tryingto think whether it was some thing from thisside can be done.PRESIDENT:Just don't think there is, Bob. HALDEMAN:That, what you're hanging up on, what we'rehanging up on, now is if there, if thereshould be a move on me, it should follow or compliment, should be tied with, it shouldfollow a move&#8482; on Dean. You can't -(coughs)excuse me -you can't make the move on Dean...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.6PRESIDENT:YeahHALDEMAN:...until you have some reason for it.PRESIDENT:That's right. Basically he, he's not, heyou see, has not confessed -well, in a sense, he's confessed to me but he hasn't tothe Attorney General and officially youunderstand it?HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:They have their arm&#8482;s length of the alldiscussions. So...HALDEMAN:'cept they don't have, the basis if youdon't have the basis -it's makes you lookbad here...PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMIAN:In a sense that -because there's the publicmind...PRESIDENT:Um hum.HALDEMAN:...has Dean pretty well fixed, they haveMitchell pretty well fixed and they have Magruder pretty well fixed.PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:They keep -they're, they're, they're carefulabout fixing me. They, they say the closestto fixing we they get is, I must have known.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALLIEDIAN:Because the way we ran things here, couldn'thappen without me knowing.PRESIDENT:That's right.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.7HALDEMAN:And that imputes to the White House thecontrol of the campaign, and somewhere itseems to me that's got to be pumped on. Youknow, you controlled all of your campaigns.PRESIDENT:Huh? Before.HALDEMAN:But as President you weren't able to controlyour campaign.PRESIDENT:Deliberately did not. HALDEMAN:And I would (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:Deliberately (unintelligible). Right.HALDEMAN:...and didn't really try to, to except tokeep on top of what when on.PRESIDENT:Ehrlichman (unintelligible)...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) idea now. PRESIDENT:Hmm. HALDEMAN:Well, we got to be a little careful aboutthat because there was in the, uh, postWatergate area, era, uh,PRESIDENT:Campaign. HALDEMAN:...there was a, a political meeting twice aweek in Ehrlichman's office, with uh,...PRESIDENT:Okay. HALDEMAN:...MacGregor and, and Harlow...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.8PRESIDENT:I was referring though to the...HALDEMAN:...and Mitchell I think came...PRESIDENT:...I was referring to the, uh, thepre-Watergate thing.HALDEMAN:Yeah, and they're; uh, -really none of ushad, it's amazing, when you go back and lookthrough the papers how little any of us, you or me or Ehrlichman, was involved in any of that stuff.PRESIDENT:Talking a little about you know what I mean,we all know soon what's going to happen on that case in California, you know, I, uh,...HALDEMAN:Ellsberg.PRESIDENT:Ellsberg, right. I, uh, had filled John in.He prob--...HALDEMAN:Yes, he's told me.PPESIDENT:...(unintelligible). 11ust worry the hellout of him but, Bob, uh, he had to worry about it,HALDEMAN:That's rightPRESIDENT:...knew that was going to come out, I mean,they, uh, uh...HALDEMAN:He's not, no, he's not uptight about it atall.PRESIDENT:Let me tell you why, the, the reason thatis, as you know, that photo was in that file and they were bound to find it.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.9HALDEMAN:Yeah, I didn't know that, but, uh...PRESIDENT:Did you hear about it?HALDEMAN:No, not until I heard that tape yesterday.I, I still don't know what that means -you mean that they took a picture, when theybroke in, and that picture was in Hunt'sfile in the stuff they turned over to the FBI.PRESIDENT:That's why Dean's saying that, the uh,Ehrlichman is uh, uh, that, that Hunt'sgonna blow the whistle on him, is black mailing.HALDEMAN:Does Ehrlichman know that, that photo was inthe file?PRESIDENT:Yes, he does. But Ehrlichman, Ehrlichmansays he, he knows about the break-in.HALDEMAN:Oh yeah.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) told him, I mean the pointis that break-in, -therefore, Bob, isn't a question of the photo, it's all, it's alladmitted, no question about that beingproved -that Dean up and told 'em, all about it.HALDEMAN:Well one 'Interesting development that getsinto this whole time, time becomes one hell of a problem here and it scents to me for your sake, speed is of the essence, that...PRESIDENT:Um, hum.HALDEMAN:...every hour sooner everything can happen,the better.PPESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:But, uh, Dash told Garment yesterday thatthey want Ehrlichman and me next week at the Senate Committee, uh, in-internal. You knowthat pre-, preliminary meeting kind ofthing.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.10PRESIDENT:Um hum.HALDEMAN:Because they're doing their interviews tobuild their case for the hearings.PRESIDENT:Well, you and Ehrlichman have got to getbefore a Grand Jury before then-(unintelligible) go.HALDEMAN:See, that's what John's view was. PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEDMAN:That we can't get up there until we've goneto the Grand Jury...PRESIDENT:Absolutely. That's gonna be that should beyour view throughout, everybody here, wewill not go before that Committee until, uh,we have understood, you could say, that we were to be before the Grand Jury, as soon as we finish the Grand Jury -you've askedCongress that's-(unintelligible). Yourlawyers are, should get me a letter, (unintelligible) will get me a letter. I'll have, I&#8482;ll have that ready to go. And you,-you know, but you and John should notappear before that -at the end. Uh, well I guess you don't want Garment to tell them.HALDEMAIN:'Cause I must say now it really looks as if,uh, you have more privacy at the Senate Committee than you do with the Grand Jury. That Grand Jury thing's in credible. Theprosecutors 'apparently called Jack Andersonin...PRESIDENT:Yeah, I know. I heard about it.HALDEMAN:...and convinced him that he was disservingthe case by printing this stuff. So he's not gonna print it verbatim anymore he's gonna paraphrase.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.11PRESIDENT:Yeah. (Laughs).HALDEMAN:Which just makes it even worse. Even it'sverbatim...PRESIDENT:Except that when the prosecutors told himthat, Jack Anderson said that he was gettingit from a good Republican. What do you meana good Republican, you mean a Republican on the staff that would remain -I mean the prosecutor's staff. Who you talking about.That's ridiculous. It's somebody -I thinkit's Glasner or Glaysner or whatever his name is, but that's not very true.HALDEMAN:That's probably from one-of the court -oneof the reporters.PRESIDENT:Well, it could be. I doubt it though. HALDEMAN:How could he keep on doing that though. Ijust, that's what bothers me cause I gobefore the Grand Jury and they put it, put it...up and give Jack Anderson my minutes...PRESIDENT:Um, hum, um hum.HALDEMAN:...and he selects what he's gonna paraphraseto put out, you're gonna have...PPESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...another...PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...(unintelligible) who cares. PRESIDNET:Right.HALDEMAN:he's gonna...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.12PRESIDENT:Oh Bob, your stuff is out anyway.HALDEMAN:Yeah, it really is.PRESIDENT:Right. Oh, that, that a couple of quickthings. He said that, uh, -this is all this stuff here (unintelligible) -that uh, hetalked about Segretti, and, uh, they'retrying to get into the fact that Segretti had apparently had something to do with the Jackson memorandum on Muskie or somethinglike that. Apparently, they left the thingthat's, that's hanging on Segretti. He says Segretti's scared, and I said is that why hepled the Fifth Amendment? He said maybe so.He said also -we're trying to check through that he did in a Canuck letter Jesus Christ, I don't know anything about who did theCanuck letter. You know nothing abouteither of those. Of course, you're line with Segretti's is going to be, that he totally exceeded his... authority now.HALDEMAN:Well, yeah, in the first place that, that hedidn't have...PRESIDENT:...any authority from you, I know.HALDEMAN:...any authority from me, nor did I haveknowledge of what he did, I had a 'knowledge of the premise on which (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) he was supposed to haveHALDEMAN:...set upPRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:...and that was clearly...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and was specifically spelled out to himnot to be anything illegal.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.13PRESIDENT:Somebody, incidentally, in that connectionis preparing to (unintelligible) somebodythe counterattack that we're gonna make ontheir campaign tactics. Is that correct, or is that false?HALDEMAN:I don't know now. They were, but I haven'tstayed in touch with thatPRESIDENT:I think it is necessary if you could getbefore the Committee -that you be preparedto do that. See? The minute you get beforethat Committee, you gotta do that.HALDEMAN:Yeah. (Pause)PRESIDENT:Now Ehrlichman realizes that they may callDean up there and Dean will have to reveal what the operation was. And that's gonna be a hell of a story, of course. Watergatebuggers broke in Ellsberg's office. Boy, ohwow, huh! How do you evaluate that? Now, the bad thing -who knows, you know. There's so much now. It appears more and more thatwe're I guess (unintelligible) wrong. Here,I see where they fired some poor guy that hired a college kid for the purposes ofparticipating in counter demonstrations andI can't understand that either. (Unintelligible)...HALDEMAN:(unintelligible) why is that George Gordon.He was in here in your office on that dayReese brought the young guys in. He was the more valuable guy. (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Right. I know that Bob, but -what in thename of God is wrong with that?HALDEMAN:Not a damn thing, and it just...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.14PRESIDENT:You've got (unintelligible). Do they think,they think for one moment that thedemonstrators, that get us all over theplace, were all unpaid?HALDEMAN:Well, of course not.PRESIDENT:They were not paid.HALDEMAN:And we weren't, we -he wasn't puttingdemonstrators in to hit them.PRESIDENT:No.HALDEMAN:He was putting people into the demonstratorsthat were getting us, to find out what they were doing.PRESIDENT:That's right. We can do something aboutthis. And I don't think people like the, uh, you know, the uh, what they did. That's why I said if you could -may I just say onthe counterattacks (unintelligible) career,(unintelligible) tire to do much on that. But let's get ready on that, shall we? Another thing is that Ehrlichman and youshould put together, Ehrlic-, apparently apretty formidable thing, some thing that Ziegler could perhaps get, get out in anpolicy sense -the Presidential initiativescalling within the staff for action on this thing. You know what I mean that Ehrlichman mentioned several things I'd forgotten. Hesays that I said look for Chist sakes, getthis out, get a hold of MacGregor, get a hold of this one, get out a statement getsworn statements from, get -uh, this waslater, but all through the summer I was gonna...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.15HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Uh, or do you think that's worth it?HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:I think the record that I was not heresitting on my ass to watch my purse like ayou know pig in a poke. Or is that worth itnow?HALDEMAN:I think something is. No, I think it is.I&#8482;m, I'm not sure...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...whether you want that out separately orwhether you try to tie that into...PRESIDENT:Um hum.HALDEMAN:...something that is the next step. PRESIDENT:Right. Oh it's only part of the step. Iagree, I agree. Don't just throw it outthere and let it be tilled. But, I -theentire record has got to be put out by somebody, uh, it may be. Look it here -the way I look at it is that you, when beforethe Ervin Committee have got to be the guydefending the White House on the campaign, and also defending the campaign. Bob. Idon't mean I'd (unintelligible) in thecampaign, but what I-mean is, this, uh, if you could, you been thinking of that anyway, you know.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And I was thinking anybody else can't do it,Ehrlichman can't do it, so forth and so on.But, by God, you canAPRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.16PRESIDENT(CONTINUED):and that's gonna be a very importantfunction for you. I think, in addition tothat, there's got to be some body, I mean Ehrlichman or somebody who's got to get outthat Nixon directed the Watergate thing,which is not one of just sitting on my ass, you know -asking everybody, asking the-White House people were you involved. I nevermade a statement, Ziegler never made astatement without I don't think that Ziegler lied. I don't. I'm just not going to letanybody keep making that statement. He didnot, he never lied. Ziegler always recorded what he had been told, you know. He didn't go out there and deliberately lie to saythat somebody had been cleared. Do youthink he did?HALDEMAN:No, but, but see, that's what their(unintelligible) is, is -no. Well,Mollenhoff's hitting him that he lied He,he's sent up this screen thing. But I don't think the others buy that, but what they dobuy is that his credibility is no good,because what he told them has now proved not to be correct.PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:Not because he intentionally lied, but, butbecause he was not told the correct information...PRESIDENT:Uh, huh.HALDEMAN:...to tell them. PRESIDENT:That's all right. That's what he's got tosay. We've got to save Ziegler now, youknow.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.17HALDEMAN:Okay, but so then now they challenge him.He says -now like, like they withinyesterday -he said the White House staff,"There have been no changes in the White House staff.&#64258; Uh, and then they say, "Well,how could we believe that any more than...maybe that's what they told you, but, but, maybe there have been."PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:And, uh, "How do we know that there's any...PRESIDENT:...say of my own knowledge or gentle men, myown knowledge or something like that. Youknow what I mean. And he's got to separateit out. Ziegler's, uh -well White House press secretaries are often attacked for lying...HALDEMAN:Oh, yeah.PRESIDENT:...representatives and so forth and Iwouldn't get all spent up about that.HALDEMAN:No, and I, I think that's but I think it'suh,...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:...it's another area, that -but there needsto be more action on business as usual inhere, I think. I think that's want I'm...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...trying to say. There needs to be a, uh,uh, within the inside. Now to their credit,some of the young guys in here got together yesterday and, uh, said these are, you got;and I'll tell you, you got some shits inthis place, but you got about 90 percent of just really sterling people.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.18PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:And they on their own initiative gottogether and said we're getting hacked fromthe outside here on this crap about everybody buried himself in the White Houseand the, the you know.PRESIDENT:Well the one thing I'm (unintelligible) allthe secretaries.HALDEMAN:Well, that's the one idea that came out ofthat meeting.PRESIDENT:Another thing I'm going to do, I'm having along meeting with Shultz today, and I'mhaving a meeting with the Troika.HALDEMAN:I, uh, -you do need to do that. PRESIDENT:Oh, and I'm having a meet --, a meetingSaturday morning.HALDEMAN:Good.PRESIDENT:Uh, who with? Judge. HALDEMAN:These guys made the point -they recognize,they said it's obvious that, that some ofthe people here have got to concentrate on,on this other thing. In the meantime, it's up to us to rally to the cause here.PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:And get, keep things going right and lookingright while we're doing that. One thing they came up with as an idea, that I'm notso sure is bad, is that we haul in, uh, thestaff and the sub-cabinet for another one of these periodic briefings that we do, thatwe've done, you know, from time to time,absolutely without your participation.PPESIDENT:This time.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.19HALDEMAN:No, no they say that if, if it's aimperative fact in this that the Presidentmust not participate but where, uh,Ehrlichman gives them a run-down on the energy...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:status and Shultz gives them a rundown onthe economics, (unintelligible) gives them a rundown on the (unintelligible). Look...PRESIDENT:Right, right, right.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) run out. And I made 'thepoint that yet that -this is very delicatebut it's got to be worked out and I thinkmaybe it can be. We can't overlook the fact that the Watergate factors's here, you know...PRESIDENT:We're not overlooking it.HALDEMAN:And we're not overlooking it, but we can'toverlook the fact that all of us have far more important missions in the long track...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...than that and,... PRESIDENT:...and the President is (unintelligible)doing everything we can to get to the bottomof this. Believe me, uh, every individual here is expend --, is expendable, uh, in the event that the Watergate thing is, uh,touches him, even, even innocently, you knowor something like that.HALDEMAN:Yeah. I just gotta make this point andget...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.20PRESIDENT:Very good.HALDEMAN:...and get everybody sorta...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...snapped back into, uh,... PRESIDENT:But could you do that? Could you do thatsoon?HALDEMAN:I, I think so. PRESIDENT:Well, I'm all for it, I'm all for it. HALDEMAN:And I think it's probably a good thing todo.PRESIDENT:Well, I don't think I'd try to do it maybeFriday night or this status thing.HALDEMAN:First of the week maybe.PRESIDENT:Tomorrow -well do it Monday, why don't youdo it Monday. Put it down, Bob let&#8482;s follow it. Let's kick, kick hard.HALDEMAN:Good.PRESIDENT:Let me come back now to our tapes ofyesterday, our --you, had you -let me ask you two or three questions. Uh, have you,you haven't had a chance to listen to therest?HALDEMAN:No, I'll do it after the lawyers meetingtoday.PRESIDENT:Um. When will that be? HALDEMAN:We're meeting with them at 10:30. I don'tknow how long that'll take, but as soon aswelfare through with that I, you know.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.21PRESIDENT:What you have for the rest is the rest ofthat day.HALDEMAN:Yeah, but I can check forward and backward alittle bit and see whether you'd have anything.PRESIDENT:Hmm.HALDEMAN:It's just, you justI don't meant to be, uh,slow on that, but it's...PRESIDENT:I know.HALDEMAN:You got to understand (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I know. HALDEMAN:...like looking at a piece paper where youcan skim through it...PRESIDENT:I know, I know. HALDEMAN:...have to listen to the whole thing, youcan't skim...PRESIDENT:I know. What did happen after that, thatday, the 21st? Did I see Dean again that day?HALDEMAN:Yes sir. Well, not alone, I don't believe.PRESIDENT:That's one. I didn't see him alone is theimportant thingHALDEMAN:You saw him with Mitchell and us and thenyou saw him with John and me. You saw himtwice more that day but, but...PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.22HALDEMAN:...groups. No. No. No. No. Wait I&#8482;mwrong. Let me get my book. Bring me in thegreen, uh, Presidential log book. You knowthe one I mean? Uh...PRESIDENT:When did he go to Camp David?HALDEMAN:Friday, I believe.PRESIDENT:Huh? HALDEMAN:Friday, I think. PRESIDENT:When was the, the 21st?HALDEMAN:Wednesday. Let me get the log book. Let'sbe sure, 'cause, I'm, I'm...PRESIDENT:Isn't it your-view thatthat basically iswhat Dean's talking about with regard tothis bomb -big playHALDEMAN:Maybe, but I don't see how. I think, it'ssome, I think something else and just tryingto go back through the Deanstuff to seewhat it could be. I think, think-(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:The reason I asked is that Petersenmentioned to Higby the fact that, uh, "Don'tlot the President get into the position of obstructing justice." Well, hell, I don'tknow what the hell he means.HALDEMAN:Uh, he may mean the business of you, uh,saying, "Don't give immunity."PRESIDENT:Uh, I've changed. We've covered that base.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.23HALDEMAN:Okay. You, that was your last meeting withDean.

So you had ten minutes with Dean and Mitchell either before or after John and I.PRESIDENT:Well, I had Mitchell alone, I don't knowwhether Dean...HALDEMAN:This shows Dean was there. PRESIDENT:Uh huh.HALDEMAN:It can be wrong, this you know, there can bemistakes in this log.PRESIDENT:I recall that I had Mitchell stay back, aminute, remain back, I don't remember Deanout there.HALDEMAN:You see he may have waited in the outeroffice, you may have kept Mitch-Mitchell inyour inner office and Dean may have waitedin the outer office for Mitchell to come out.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.26PRESIDENT:Uh, that's more likely...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). But then the girlwouldn't know. She doesn't know until theycome out of the outer door. Then that afternoon was when you had your meeting withEhrlichman and Shultz when Shultz yourhelicopter landed and Shultz went on talking.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:And-you wrote that memo about--it was one ofShultz' better moments. And then you left for Key Biscayne at six o'clock or 6:30.PRESIDENT:Right, so I must have called Dean from KeyBiscayne then.HALDEMAN:Well, if you did, we wouldn't have a tape. PRESIDENT:What date is that?HALDEMAN:That's the 22nd.PRESIDENT:By that time, Dean was... HALDEMAN:Dean went to Camp--I'm not sure whether Deanwent to Camp David on the 23rd or the 24thbut, uh, somewhere in there, he went to CampDavid. I, I'm told it was the 23rd. Then when he came back...PRESIDENT:And he stayed until when?HALDEMAN:The 26th. PRESIDENT:Um hum. Of March.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.27HALDEMAN:But then you never met with him again.PRESIDENT:I didn't.HALDEMAN:See on the 30th we went to California. Wegot back here from Camp David the 28thPRESIDENT:Oh, I made my speech the 28thHALDEMAN:...you came back from Key Biscayne onMonday night, the 26th.PRESIDENT:Right. Then I worked on my speech.

Then you went over to look at your new bowling alleythat evening.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:With Julie. PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Then the next morning, Wednesday, wasa--well you were working on your speech and you saw me for a few minutesPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...in the morning, for about an hour at noon, and for...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...twenty minutes at the end of the day.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:Thursday you met with Shultz for a fewminutes in the morning and Kissinger for afew minutes, me for a 'Lew minutes mid day.Then you did have Ehrlichman and me in on Thursday.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:For two hours.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.29PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:2:30 to 4:30 and Ziegler in for a little bitduring that. And that was--I've the, gotnotes on...PRESIDENT:Something must have developed that day.HALDEMAN:Yeah, it was getting Ziegler to putsomething out.PRESIDENT:Oh, oh, Ziegler was making--that's right.

You made the speechthat night and then the next day you were just up to your ass in alligators.PRESIDENT:I know, I know, John, uh, I know, Bob.HALDEMAN:Uh, State legislators and some fellowfrom...PRESIDENT:Right, right. HALDEMAN:...Shultz,(phone rings)a jillion things. And then we left for California that evening at 6:00 or 5:30.PRESIDENT:6:00 the 30th?APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.30HALDEMAN:You met with Ehrlichman and me for an hourhere before we left.PRESIDENT:That was, that was, that was the week inCalifornia.HALDEMAN:That's right, that was. The next night wasthe John Ford dinner.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:And you spent a lot of time with us thatmorning.PRESIDENT:Yeah. We were still talking Watergate then.That was under you...HALDEMAN:Ehrlichman's going to work on Watergate.PRESIDENT:That's how we were trying to get out thatwhole business...HALDEMAN:And... PRESIDENT:See why I had Ehrlichman do this I don'tknow, what, I mean we, you could try toreconstruct it and say, "Well, I lost confidence in Dean.&#64258; I don't think it was that so much as that Dean was under so muchheat, I just figured...HALDEMAN:...You just weren't getting anywhere. Youwere getting, you were--it was a s-, typicalmove where you weren't getting results oneway and you started attacks in another way. It wasn't so much lost confidence ...PRESIDENT:Right. That's it. Right.HALDEMAN:John's (unintelligible) really lostconfidence it was just lost, uh...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.31PRESIDENT:Just gotta get more...HALDEMAN:You weren't getting results.PRESIDENT:Wasn't satisfied with results.HALDEMAN:And Dean was saying, "Now I can t get thisthing down."PRESIDENT:That's when we talked about, having the,making a public statement with, with Miller in California and all the rest.HALDEMAN:That's rightPRESIDENT:That's a long time ago. All right, I've gotthat ticket pretty well in mind. Now let's look at this business. First with regard tothese tapes. I don't know how you canreconstruct it, but I think that the, for, for your information, the directive I've given you is, uh, its been customarywithout, and I, I don't think it should everget out that we taped this office, Bob. Have we got people that are trustworthy on that? I guess we have.HALDEMAN:I think so.PRESIDENT:If it does, the answer is yes. We only, butwe only taped the National Security, uh,information. All other, all other, allother information is scrapped, never transcribed. Get the point? That's what I want you to remember on these, if you will.See my point. That's just a memorandum foryour file basically that you make, that you are, but, uh,--I think that's veryimportant, very important You never want tobe in a position to say the President taped it, you know. I mean taped somebody.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.32HALDEMAN:Well, the whole purpose of this was forNational Security.PRESIDENT:That's right, I uh,...HALDEMAN:The reason they were... PRESIDENT:You mean...HALDEMAN:...other steps were taken...PRESIDENT:Yeah. I know, I know. HALDEMAN:...for taping other places. PRESIDENT:I know but I just don't want this to be-Ijust don't want that tape for example, Idon't want you to, I don't want you to disclose that to Ehrlichman or anybody else,I mean that's just something--I know whatyou can tell Ehrlichman. Just say you went over it and it's about the same as...HALDEMAN:I've, I've already, what I said to him is,is that the tape--he knows I...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...went over it of course. Uh, I said, "It,it basically says what the President recalled."PRESIDENT:That's right. Now, with regard to the... HALDEMAN:Which it does. It's--your recollection ofthat was almost, almost verbatim,(unintelligible).APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.33PRESIDENT:Not very, not completely. The question iswhether or not--did I at that time, orderDean to pay off Hunt, "Go to work, Dean...&#64258;HALDEMAN:No. PRESIDENT:&#64257;...the money to pay him off.&#64258;HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:Not at the point that (unintelligible).You're sure I didn't. Didn't I say, "Well, now what ought to be done is to put the corkin the bottle," or some damn silly thing. Idon't know. I thought IHALDEMAN:Yeah, but if it was, that was rescinded andit was a, and it was a, it was a, "shouldn'twe do this, we at least have to do that.&#64258; You were drawing him out. You did not order him to.PRESIDENT:With regard to clemency, if the subject evercomes up, you could say it uh must have, quite (unintelligible) obviously, it, uh,-- you can say it and, "The matter wasdiscussed (unintelligible) the people." Andthe way it came up, is that, I there talk about uh, doing it before Christmas, youknow, doing it at Christmas. And I said,"Well, you couldn't even consider it until after 1974. We do it without the elections.&#64258; You understand?HALDEMAN:Yeah.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.34PRESIDENT:I mean couldn't even consider it, I meanthat's the point, because, because that putsit more in the context of the crime, seewhat I mean?HALDEMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:I don't know, do you?HALDEMAN:I don't... PRESIDENT:What troubles me is whether Dean, Dean hasmade a memorandum of this. Well, the factthat he had memoranda is irrelevant withwhat (unintelligible)...HALDEMAN:Well, let's, let's look at this pointthough.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:That area is totally privileged until youcome to an impeachment proceeding. There'sno way that that can be brought out becauseit--there's no way that, that the Presidential, there's no forum for going into Presidential, uh, guilt, except animpeachment.PRESIDENT:I know. HALDEMAN:And they have got to impeach you firstbefore the proceeding starts and they aren'tgoing to impeach you.PRESIDENT:No, I, I slept a little on that and it'sgood for John to look at it that way. MyGod, what the hell have we done to beimpeached?APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.35HALDEMAN:But John doesn't believe you have either andJohn doesn't believe you can be impeached.PRESIDENT:No.HALDEMAN:Or, or will be. What he believes is... PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:...that's, that's the game Dean is trying toplay.PRESIDENT:That's right. That's what he's talking. HALDEMAN:Does not believe it's, uh, it's a game ofany potential.PRESIDENT:Uh.(Pause)I made a call, that's the thing you have toremember, sometime about what the hell we going to do about--what's been done about Hunt, money he's asked for. You know what Imean?APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.36HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:That's a possibility, Bob. Now how wouldyou, how would we talk about that problem.(Unintelligible) trying to find out what...HALDEMAN:What he was up to...PRESIDENT:What, what this thing, how deep this thingran. I had to find out. All right now, the big question: when I learned this on the 21st -why didn't I go running right over tothe Attorney General and say, "Look, I foundoutthat Hunt is, Bittman's asking for, for money." It is a question of how long ittook me to, to reach the, the, theconclusion that we reached, you know, that Dean (unintelligible) 14th, you know, Ehrlichman went over to give his report.(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Hmm, you didn't know what the facts were. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:You didn't (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Uh, you didn't know where, where they stoodon it, they were still...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:talking to Hunt and all that and it wasn't,there wasn't a timely problem there anyway. I mean it wasn't a matter of something, thatwhatever Hunt knows or doesn't know, he'sgonna go on knowing, or not knowing.PRESIDENT:No, no. The question is whether or notthat, that Hunt, (unintelligible) didn'tknow, but the fact that an overture had been made by Hunt's attorney for, for payments.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.37HALDEMAN:But you didn't know what the nature of thispayment business was. You didn't know whatthey were talking about in terms ofpayments. 'Cause you were trying to smoke it out.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:That's right. Then you were trying to smokeout whether that involved other payments and you know, was this the first time and thenDean in this conversation logged in a, it'lltake a million dollars over some, over the next year.PRESIDENT:I, I remember that I logged that in...HALDEMAN:Okay. PRESIDENT:...I can recall... HALDEMAN:Okay. Right. Was that a million dollars toHunt or to all of the defendants and the,it, it, it comes to your attention that somebody has been working something out with the other defendants. You logged that in.Well, you said, what about the CubanCommittee? And, uh,...PRESIDENT:Yeah, I said, uh, I said, "How will you dothis?"HALDEMAN:You didn't, you didn't know,... PRESIDENT:...Cuban Committee... HALDEMAN:...you didn't...PRESIDENT:I had read about the Cuban Committee in thepaper that's true.HALDEMAN:That's right. Well, then you didn't knowthen and I submit that you don't know now.PRESIDENT:That's right. Who did it. Well, I didn'tknow then...HALDEMAN:Where's the line drawn between a legitimateeffort to provide legal fees and anillegitimate effort to buy off defendants.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.38PRESIDENT:Then the question comes, "Mr. President, didyou know the effort was even being made tobuy -pay legal fees?&#64258; And the answer is, Ididn't. I did not know that, I didn't know...HALDEMAN:Not til this point.PRESIDENT:I didn't know about the 350. HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:I didn't know about the launching ofKalmbach.HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:You remember.HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:I, I did not know, uh, I had read, I hadread stories to that effect, but I didn't frankly look into them. But basically, Ifrankly had this -I said, "Well, it must bea bunch of Cubans, or something like that and I thought of (unintelligible). (Both talk at once)PRESIDENT:I didn't know about La Costa. My point isand I'm not trying to be selfish, but I, the point is, the story is very true that Ididn't know a thing. Now there's only oneweakness in that, that, the Pappas thing, the Pappas thing, where he said, "Yes I know about Pappas.&#64258; But...HALDEMAN:Oh, but that was right in that same timeframe.PRESIDENT:I know, I know-But he said, "I understand--" Did I say, "I understand that Pappas ishelping," or, he said, "Pappas was helping?"HALDEMAN:He said, "Mitchell has talked to Pappas.&#64258;You just quickly logged it in,...know.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.39PRESIDENT:Yes, yes, I know. Well, the point was whatI was referring to only was not thatMitchell had talked to Pappas, but thatPappas never mentioned that here in this office. Never mentioned that, I know. Allhe said is that, I'm helping uh, helping,uh, uh, uh, John's special projects," and I said, "Well thank you very much. I appreciate it very much." He didn't tell methat it was about.HALDEMAN:Okay. PRESIDENT:So after that conversation...HALDEMAN:Okay. Now that -See...PRESIDENT:You see what I mean. (Unintelligible)... HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) all this stuff.HALDEMAN:Yeah. But it's, again, you're a long waysfrom having to make this case. You need to know what John has, but, uh, that was, that, that Pappas thing was so, you know, just,just--your "I know" was almost lost in thething, he, he was going on, you injected, I know&#64258; He he to be damn alert to haveremembered that and put it down.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:And you gotta assume that maybe he was, but,but the odds are very much against it.PRESIDENT:Well, that's what they were.HALDEMAN:Unless he's got a tape or something else.But I just don't -tape. I do not acceptthat as even a remote possibility.PRESIDENT:I just can't believe that anybody, that evenJohn Dean, would come into this office with a tape recorder.HALDEMAN:And I think if he did, that's one morediscrediting thing on him. I mean you just make the point that that's inconceivable,that a man...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.40PRESIDENT:...tape recorder, puts that out in thepress.HALDEMAN:But then that indicates he was coming in totry to trap the President. So what was his motive, what were your motives, what werethe Justice Department's motives andprosecutors' motives at that point? They didn't know there was, that -you look at the things in the context of the times. Therewas no -at that point, there wasn't any realfeeling that there was a cover-up thing, that's come out. That's just(unintelligible) out of Dean's thing, Deanreport.PRESIDENT:Well, I think there had been hush money talkJohn, Bob.HALDEMAN:It was a story, there was a hush money storyand James McCord...PRESIDENT:McCord, McCord remember, said "Hush money,"didn't he...?HALDEMAN:I'm not sure when. Somewhere in there hedid...PRESIDENT:Before March. But, uh, there was a hushmoney story.HALDEMAN:I don't know. PRESIDENT:Oh, yeah, sure. Well anyway it doesn't makeany differ-that's, uh, that's what it is.But, uh, he was practically saying thatHunt's, uh, -he said, "Look, Hunt needs money here. Bittman has said that. Hunt'sgot to get money here or he'll blow all theseamy help -the seamy side.&#64258; Wasn't that the story, this is (unintelligible)...HALDEMAN:"Bring Ehrlichman to his knees."PRESIDENT:"I'll bring Ehrlichman to his kneesimmediately."HALDEMAN:&#64257;...&#8482;Cause I'll put out the seamy thingsthat I did for him and Krogh."APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.41PRESIDENT:Basically, basically the Dean, uh, the Dean(unintelligible) might be, that he said hetold the President that he was going to dothis. The President, as a result, said to him(unintelligible). There, and so that is thePresident being engaged in. Dean told me when I called him on Sunday, I recol-, Irecollected this. He said, "You know I knowhow that statement with regard to no immunitygot into your st-, into your statement.&#64258; Andhe just, he logged that out, this is a guessof course, he (unintelligible). Remember theApril 17th tape. But, I'm just trying to look at things as he may (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:He told Larry, that. That whoever, that hisstatement you know, that," I'm not gonna be ascapegoat and all that. "He put that out -hesaid7That, that reached the right place."PRESIDENT:That it reached the right place.HALDEMAN:And he said, "The people that I was talking togot the signal, something to that effect.PRESIDENT:Um hmm. HALDEMAN:Said' I'm not out to get anybody, I'm not, Iwas just thinking...PRESIDENT:It's true the signal (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:It got through.PRESIDENT:Huh?HALDEMAN:He said, "I was sending a signal and-it gotthrough." And that, "The people I was sending it to under stood."(Pause)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) meant that it got to me,understand. 'Cause we said, "He's not gonnabe a scapegoat.&#64258; (Unintelligible) all thefacts. (Unintelligible) thing, that's beengood. That's been proper. This is because ofhis threats that he -he never made any threatsto me. Meaning, you know, about, uh, he said, "Hunt was gonna blow the whistle," -not thathe was...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.42HALDEMAN:He had a tough problem though, I think that, that the one thing that he put out on your conversation is unfortunate saying,"You're still my counsel."PRESIDENT:I didn't say that.HALDEMAN:But, he says you did.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:And, uh, that's his -and that was the headline: "Nixon Calls Dean, Says You&#8482;re Still My Counsel.&#64258; That gets to this thing that I keep saying and I, I...PRESIDENT:...that, he has to go. But let me say...HALDEMAN:...and that you shouldn't express confidencein him.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah. All right. I know, I agreewith that, but, but you're still myassistant. Ehrlichman's still that, this andthat, but my point that, I make there is that all, every move I make with Dean I check with Petersen. I said, "Now anybodyis to leave here...&#64258;HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:&#64257;...I want to know."HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And I said. "Are you dealing with Dean?"&#64257;Yes, we&#8482;re still talking to him in terms of...&#64258;HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:No sir, I can defend that -not confidence. It's up to...HALDEMAN:Well, it gives the appearance, the public appearance if not so, because he put it out. You doing it privately to Dean is fine. his...PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.43HALDEMAN:putting it out publicly is not, because itputs you in the problem then of when you dohave to move on Dean, whichis inevitable-I would assume. I mean, they have to either indict him or give him immunity andyou've got to move on Dean if--either way.Uh, when you do...PRESIDENT:One thing you and Bob--John got to work onis the game plan on how you handle JohnDean. I mean the uh, you see. Let's faceit, you uh, you and Bob remember, the only reason I put the immunity thing in thereBob, John, I mean Bob,...HALDEMAN:Um hum. PRESIDDENT:...&#8482;cause John insisted it go in there, do you recall?HALDEMAN:Yes, I sure do.PRESIDENT:I think Colson did too as I recall. ButJohn was the one. But say&#352;be sure that you say that nobody gets immunity and tellPetersen nobody&#8482;s to get immunity &#338; that itis.REEL 2 BEGINSWhether that was a good move or not, I donot know.REEL 1 ENDS (Unintelligible) as far as the individualsare concerned.HALDEMAN:I don't know, I think... PRESIDENT:On the other hand, giving him immunity, he'sgonna always have something hanging overyour head anyway, isn't he? If you got that kind of guy.HALDEMAN:Well,...PRESIDENT:The only thing is...HALDEMAN:...Also...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.44PRESIDENT:...Dean&#8482;s gonna be (unintelligible). It's a question really, Bob, which I(unintelligible) with your attorneys, Ishould look -how is he going to to be most vindictive. He knows a lot of ambitiousthings. He's gonna be most vindictive as awitness, with immunity, or most vindictive? And they say well yes, he's got to prove a lot because you know, uh, well, he's gotenough to prove. No problem there. But asfar as the President's concerned, he's got to be most vindictive, because -we reallygot to put the (unintelligible) out. Comeback to that once again.HALDEMAN:Well, the problem you got... PRESIDENT:Let's leave out Ehrlichman and Haldeman,but, here's Dean -how's he gonna take on thePresident. The President's kindness.HALDEMAN:Okay, then how do you, how do you... PRESIDENT:...live with it?HALDEMAN:How do you live with that? And how do youlive with the knowledge that other people have?PRESIDENT:Oh, well, no, no. The immunity doesn't,doesn't get, doesn't mean that he (unintelligible) doesn't know that he has a crime. It only means that you don't, don'thit him for it. Because he talked.HALDEMAN:Yeah, but the only reason for grantingimmunity, to any witness, is to nail a moreimportant defendant.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:Immunity to the defendant is to make him awitness for the purpose of nailing a more,more important defendant in terms of someonewho...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.45PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Well it goes back to their citing youbecause in your crime message you, youpushed for new immunity laws, apparently. Uh, so that we quit nailing the little guysin the Mafia rings and start nailing the bigguys.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:Okay, and that's the theory of immunity,obviously.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:And they're making a big thing out of that.So that if you give immunity to Dean...PRESIDENT:Well, they don't think I can crack him onthat.HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:Not this case.HALDEMAN:No, but the point is if you give immunity toDean...PRESIDENT:He's a major guy.HALDEMAN:Then what you're doing is saying he is alittle guy.PRESIDENT:Oh, yes, I know.HALDEMAN:And, therefore, there are major guys. Nowthey don't need Dean's immunity to make Mitchell. There are no other more major people than Mit--, than Dean, exceptEhrlichman, Haldeman and you,...PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:...in the White House and Mitchell at theCommittee.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.46PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:They've already got Mitchell. So the onlything you can give him immunity for and theonly reason they can justify immunity is if they nail someone above him. Other- wisethe immunity was a cover-up.PRESIDENT:A cover-up. Wait a minute. Cover-up forthe President maybe, but not for Ehrlichman and Haldeman? (Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Or someone within there. It's a cover-up-no, it's a cover-up to, to, uh, keep -no, no, that's right, 'cause if he talks, it'sgonna nail somebody. Okay, then it's not acover-up, it's an inducement for lying.PRESIDENT:Inducement to get somebody. HALDEMAN:Or does he get Dean off of this count,because he could get you on something, else-me, which is the fact.PRESIDENT:Me, yeah. Or something he might not be ableto get me on, but he could embarrass me.HALDEMAN:Yeah. Could make an attempt, I don't thinkhe can get you and I don't think he'll even make the attempt.PRESIDENT:Yeah, but, Bob, but, but why all thesethreats, veiled threats that he's making, John, uh,...HALDEMAN:To play his game now. Same as Magruder madeall kinds of veiled threats about lying.But when he gets down to the crunch he isn't doing it. He's, he's telling the truth.Magruder was over here saying he is going toinvolve me.PRESIDENT:Did he tell you that?APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.47HALDEMAN:Sure. He didn't tell me, he told otherpeople. He told Dean.PRESIDENT:He's gonna involve you?HALDEMAN:Sure. It was to get me lined up. He toldLarry that, I think, at some point to, uh,get the word to me. That was involve me instuff he knew it wasn't true.PRESIDENT:Magruder is supposed to lie like hell. HALDEMAN:Yeah, but I'm not sure he is now.PRESIDENT:Yeah. You're...HALDEMAN:I don't know what he's doing now. PRESIDENT:You're damn sure now that Strachan doesn'ttell...tell the truth.HALDEMAN:I've told him to. PRESIDENT:I don't want him to get in trouble. HALDEMAN:Consistently said that he's got to tell thetruth and, uh...PRESIDENT:I think he is. HALDEMAN:I assumed that he is. PRESIDENT ANDHALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:...on such materials as to whether a budgetcame over to whether lie did this or that orthe other thing.HALDEMAN:He's sure a budget didn't. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:As I understand it, he's sure that a budgetdidn't.PRESIDENT:Right.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.48HALDEMAN:He is, he does have this concern about thesethree...PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah.HALDEMAN:...pieces of paper or these three documents. PRESIDENT:But, it did not indicate that they weretelephone taps. That's true.HALDEMAN:No, they didn't and as I understand,Magruder's thing, he says they weren't identified either.PRESIDENT:Well, he said, uh, I think he's trying...HALDEMAN:And the interesting thing is all thetestimony that's come out so far indicatesthat those taps were identified by Gemstoneas a code name. Whereas the material that he had, he says was identifired as Stage Coach Two--or whatever. I don't know.That's a, it's a kind of curious, maybeirrelevant discrepancy, but it's, it's kind of -the secretary Who says that she typed this stuff up on special paper that wasidentified as Gemstone.PRESIDENT:This is on the taps. HALDEMAN:And Gordon, way back when he said, you know,there, there may be a problem becausethinking about it afterwards there are these three things that came over, these three Stage Coach Two I--, items that, uh, maybe,uh, looking back on it-may be the result ofthe Watergate.PRESIDENT:But he did not think so at the time.HALDEMAN:Not when he got it, because he didn't knowthere was a Watergate.PRESIDENT:Did he report to you that he thought thiswas tap material?HALDEMAN:No, sir.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.49PRESIDENT:And, uh, you never -you may have seenHALDEMAN:What, what he says he thinks he reported tome was that--he thinks he may have given oneof 'em to mePRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...in a stack of a lot of other stuff and that in that he may have--I-, in, in, he, he said he probably identified it as Attached Tab H or something is a, uh, is a, uh, co--,sample of the intelligence operation thatthey've got going.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Or of the output of the intelligenceoperation they've got going or something like that. Everybody says it produced nothing so, you know, it was the kind ofthing nobody was very interested in.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:And that would be the way he would do it.He, like he would send me the wholetelephone operation kit and say attached isthe, is the plan for the telephone operation, operation telephone, thing and Iwouldn't look at it.PRESIDENT:You say that as far as your precaution isconcerned that the, that Dean conversation and all you have so far the part where youhave come to, into the room, but no more.You've got, you've got, how much more would you say you've got to go on that?HALDEMAN:I would guess I have another ten or fifteenminutes maybe to go. It isn't--I don't think it's very much.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:I'm not sure, there's no way to tell.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.50PRESIDENT:Well, you've got to do some(unintelligible). I don't remember. Idon't, God damn it, until this day rememberwhat hap--, I don't really remember, do you? Whether you were told after that, well lookfor Christ sakes get this money.HALDEMAN:No, I don't think so. PRESIDENT:You don't think so? HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:'Cause (unintelligible) remembered thatmuch, Bob.HALDEMAN:And if I, were, I said that we can't.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:And I know we didn't. PRESIDENT:But I would say we'll do what you can do tohelp Mitchell but -I might of said to him.get this, this to Mitchell.HALDEMAN:Nope. PRESIDENT:Get this message to Mitchell. HALDEMAN:No, I don't even think that. I&#8218;ll--you maybe right, 'cause you've been right on therest of it and pretty accurately, but I sure don't remember that.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I remember as much as I hadthought about (unintelligible) I, I, we've got to keep the cork in the bottle and so forth. Well, even looking at all of that,looking at it, looking at it, at its worstand, let's face it the-it was not some thing that he just came in and said first reaction(unintelligible) of the White House(unintelligible) there's a cancer and he says well, it's growing daily and so forth and so on. He says there is theAPRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.51PRESIDENT:problem, for example, of the pay-offs(CONT&#8482;D)(unintelligible) recount the payments andI'd say why is that. He says well, for anexample, uh,-he's got Kalmbach in this memorandum, hasn't he. The call was made toKalmbach and then Kalmbach raised the money.Got a little on Pappas but that's almost coincidental, isn't it? It's almost incidentally. It's...HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Mitchell--Pappas is helping Mitchell, didn'the say?HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:I don't think we can... PRESIDENT:I said, Iknow about that. Now wait-goahead (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Well, I was gonna say I don't think that we"can pretend that, that we didn't know there was, was an interest on Mitchell's part inraising money for the defendants.PRESIDENT:'S right. Well, I... HALDEMAN:But I sure as hell don't know what it wasfor.PRESIDENT:I, I-wait a minute. Start... HALDEMAN:I mean, you didn't know about it, I gave you(unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:I know that. (Unintelligible) went throughthis. I really didn't.HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:I didn't know, you know, I mean I didn't. Ideliberately got--the staff protected me from it for their credit and I just wasn't getting involved.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.52HALDEMAN:It wasn't even a matter of protection. Itwas, it was not-something that was necessaryto, to get to you.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:It didn't involve you.PRESIDENT:That's right. That's right.HALDEMAN:It wasn't (unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Then, then he did (unintelligible) Bittmanis talking to O'Brien and so forth and soon. I said, well, my God, there's about$1,000 sitting beside a road and so forth. Do we go into what the seamy side was atall? The conversation didn't go on too much?HALDEMAN:No, not really. PRESIDENT:Yeah, then I said well... HALDEMAN:Little bit on the fact that it was NationalSecurity. It was--no--well, yeah, he saidit was the, uh, break-in on the Ellsberg.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Right, right. Then he ques--... HALDEMAN:And he said and some other things.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:That was the only specific he cited... PRESIDENT:And some other things and I said...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...&#8482;cause I said well, that was NationalSecurity that was involved. Yeah, but there were some other thing as. What the hellthey were I don't know.HALDEMAN:He didn't seem to either.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.53PRESIDENT:Yeah, and I said well, uh, I said alright.See, they're gonna get Hunt up and I supposeHunt could have told, told about otherthings he did. I wonder what the hell that means, though, Hunt says, well, if the WhiteHouse had, had to do that or the otherthing. It just shows the White House has a bad foul up, doesn't it.HALDEMAN:The point came up that you knew that hehad--Dean said something about, you know,you well, he had done some stuff on the, on the, uh, the ITT, the Dita Beard thing andyou said, "Oh yeah, I know that.&#64258; And thenyou said, "I didn't know," you said, you said, "I didn't know Hunt had done it, but I knew that they're working or something onthat."PRESIDENT:It's in the papers. HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:That's a fact. We (unintelligible) there.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:That's a Colson operation. Colson(unintelligible) Hunt. Iwas--(unintelligible) idea was Hunt's(unintelligible) all about. He told me that somebody had gone out there and so forth and so on. That was the last-then I wasn'tconcerned about it--I mean what the hellthat was a common--I mean in my conversation with Dean...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Are you? Not on this thing. HALDEMAN:No. PRESIDENT:It was in the papers. Yes, I remember that,I, you know -I didn't know the White Housewas involved in it and so forth. Colson never said he was. You know, heAPRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.54PRESIDENT:never told me. He told me about what was(CONT&#8482;D)going on. Held give me daily reports aboutwhat had happened to Dita Beard and so forthand so on, but you know how he was. He's, thank God. Then I said, well I said, wellnow, how about this money and he'd say well,I've got--it's gonna blow it. And I said well, we gotta, at least we oughta, at least get that much, didn't I? Or what did Isay--or we ought to keep the cork in thebottle that much or some damn phrase like that.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Is that what I said? HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:And I said, uh, how much would it cost-- amillion dollars. I said, well we can getthe money but how do we get it to the defendants? And I said, well we can do it through Cuban Committee. Right?HALDEMAN:And he said no. No, you know, that was(unintelligible)...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.55PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) way we&#8482;re doing it now.The way it's being done.HALDEMAN:No, he didn't say that.PRESIDENT:LaRue said it. (Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:No. He said, he said,. "Mitchell has LaRueout getting money," which I told him was avery bad thing to do, he shouldn't, he shouldn't be doing that.PRESIDENT:No. All right, how do you, help me, howwould you have me explain the, the(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:See, that's the other thing. If you giveDean immunity he can go into all that. Hecan't make any case but he can sure, as hell make a lot of embarrassment. If he doesn't have immunity, he, he has no incentive toget into that, area, because he is deeplyimplicated when you get into that.PRESIDENT:Oh, in other words, he's deeply implicatedso he's gonna go down and so, therefore, heturns madman and says, "I'm gonna take thePresident on, destroy this Administration, because they wouldn't give me immunity."HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:There's the argument, Bob. (pause) Right.(pause) But come back to the, put the, uh, uh, the cork in the bottle, at least we'vegot to take care of Hunt. How would youexplain that?HALDEMAN:That's exactly what you were doing. Youwere drawing him out. We're running thisthing out all the way trying to get a, trying to get a fix on what, what he thought the limits were, the parameters of it, whatoutta, you know, what at least ought to bedone or what at most ought to be done, where it was gonna lead to--because he was makingthe caseAPRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.56HALDEMAN:that this is, a, an ongoing problem that'll(Cont'd)go on not only through the, uh,Administration but after you leave.PRESIDENT:Yeah, I, can, I think I brought out thepoint that it would be used. He said thatit wouldn&#8482;t-and he said it wouldn't matterthen.HALDEMAN:He said &#64257;It&#8482;ll hurt in history, but it won'tbe significant.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Actually, what it really was, you've got torealize, it's like the La Costa conversation we had. It was really not a question of, ofsetting something up or something likethat-it was, it, it created awareness of a problem and a brainstorming on the problem and no condoning of the problem...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:...except for the fact that I said well... HALDEMAN:It was agressively doing recognition. Butthe problem was different than what wethought.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:We thought there was a, a matter of taking care of these people's fees and stuff.PRESIDENT:Yeah, that's what you thought. HALDEMAN:Then... PRESIDENT:I...HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Then...PRESIDENT:I thought...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.57HALDEMAN:...it gradually, though, later, as thisdevelops and as these pressures build up andthe Hunt thing comes into pretty much focuscause it's this big demand for, you know, "this or else" kind of thing--which is thefirst time I had ever heard of "this orelse" sort of a, of a threat, or whatever you want to call it, raised in this regard. Up until then it was "we need money forthese people to keep, you know, all thisthing on the track. Keep their attorneys in...&#64258;PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:"...in place." PRESIDENT:One thing we did do, I remember, I did giveDean the business of what the legalramifications were, I think he did andcertainly (unintelligible) . Uh, uh, uh,--I said, "What, what about the legality of payments? I mean that for fees and support.(Unintelligible)I understand that--isthat illegal? Is that obstruction of justice?"HALDEMAN:He said, "No."PRESIDENT:I don't know. HALDEMAN:Did he say, "No"? PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:I think that's in there. I think you raisedthat question and this point, this payment of legal fees and so forth--'cause that'swhat he was talking about, was paying legalfees. He said no.PRESIDENT:Then how did the blackmail stuff come tip?APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.58HALDEMAN:Well, that's because then it's the Hunt thingand, and. I guess other stuff was building upto the point of, you know, we're beingblackmailed now and as, wetalked aboutit--he, he even mentioned that as a defense.PRESIDENT:Yes, I know. Said that, "Our defense isblackmail". I think at that point I almostlaughed because I, the, President could say,"We, we paid money because we're beingblackmailed.&#64258; After saying, "We won't beblacklmailed to the Cubans,&#64258; to the others.But we did raise that point, didn't we--but Ithink I've raised it other times though, with DeanHALDEMAN:But, you see, there was, there--I don'tthink...PRESIDENT:It would indicate other knowledge of the factthat some payments were being made because Imust have had some knowledge, I mean, uh, aswe got into the, as I got into theinvestigation Vob, in February, when I firstgot into it. It was after the Viet Nam announcement, after the 23rd, after theInauguration. I never got any, any of thiscrap about defendants or attorneys&#8482; fees oranything at all here remember with you oranybody else. At that point, I first began totalk to (unintelligible) the Ervin Committee.At some point, the question of probably in addition to this conversation, and I don'twant you to need to go back to read that over,not at this point--but at this conversation onthe real question was oh, "what is the legalsituation with reqard to the payment of feesand so forth," and he said, Well you can bepaid fees, but you can't pay support.&#64258; Ithink I heard that on that case. I don't knowwhether it was support. Support...HALDEMAN:That may have been our lawyers talking to you&#8218;cause...PRESIDENT:No. No.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.59HALDEMAN:...they're, they made the point that thesupport thing doesn't, doesn't hold up atthat point in time because the defendantswere out on bail and, therefore, were able to earn their own support.PRESIDENT:When are they out on bail?HALDEMAN:They're out on bail all the time, which Ididn't know. I thought they were in jail all the time.PRESIDENT:Oh, I see.HALDEMAN:They were arraigned and let out on bail acouple of days later or, you know, theysaid.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) out all summer. Hunt andall the rest.HALDEMAN:Apparently.PRESIDENT:"Well, I've got to support these attorneys'fees-that's Mitchell's line. (Unintelligible)...HALDEMAN:No, 'cause the support thing--they thoughtthey were gonna go to jail. They wereplanning to plead guilty, they were worried about support of their families in the longhaul. I'm not, I'm not talking aboutimmediate support needs. You're looking at a guy looking down...PRESIDENT:What do your attorneys, say, uh, forexample, you say, the motive, you, John asto what makes you (unintelligible) the conspiracy thing on the support fordefendants, in other words...HALDEMAN:We didn't, we didn't... PRESIDENT:...the launching of Kalmbach and so forth. HALDEMAN:We didn't have any have any motive and wedid not launch Kalmbach. We didn't takeinitiative on any of this stuff.PRESIDENT:Okay, fine.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.60HALDEMAN:Our, our thing was passive, uh, non, nondisapproval reallyPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:and because Mitchell said there was a need,we didn't--and Dean said there was a need,we...PRESIDENT:Well, talk to, Ehrlichman did make a call toKalmbach, you see.HALDEMAN:No&#352;-talk...PRESIDENT:That's sort of, that's what at least theU.S. Attorney says.HALDEMAN:I think it-went the other way. I thinkKalmbach called Ehrlichman.PRESIDENT:Allright, whatever it is, fine. HALDEMAN:...Because Kalmbach had an agreement with usthat...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...he didn't do stuff, unless he had an okayfrom here. Because he didn't want to get into Stans' fund raising. So when Dean...PRESIDENT:Kalmbach was gonna say certainly that all hewas doing was raise money for the defendants.HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:That's right. For their attorneys' fees. HALDEMAN:That's right. Well, no he says for hu--,humanitarian purposes.PRESIDENT:That's right. Well, isn't that true?HALDEMAN:It is, I'm told. PRESIDENT:What did your attorneys say on that?You've...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.61HALDEMAN:It is.PRESIDENT:...asked them that haven't you?HALDEMAN:They're--yeah.PRESIDENT:The critical question they'll ask you, well. HALDEMAN:That&#8482;s, that&#8482;s-I've gottago 'cause Igotta get some stuff put together. That'swhat I've got to--that's one of the areas we&#8482;re gonna cover today. (Unintelligible) all that out. See we, they studied thisstuff and then they looked to the problemsand then worked backwards on them.PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:Where they see--oh, so far, they're, they'resatisfied everything they've come up with. They're satisfied with.PRESIDENT:Well, have they ever zeroed in on this, thisis subject A. I, I'm satisfied on(unintelligible) that they can't make a case. I'm sure, I'm satisfied and, uh, all the stuff in, in between. They can't make acase. The point is, except for the raisingof the money and the tran--, transaction of money for the purpose of so-called "hushmoney.&#64258; That is obstruction of justicedepending on intent. You must have discussed this with him in some language, Bob.HALDEMAN:Oh, yeah. And they're, they're, they'vebeen researching the statutes on the, on the question. They're...PRESIDENT:The question is corruption is the word.HALDEMAN:Well, one, one of them is corruption, theother one is willful. Uh,...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.62PRESIDENT:Uh, just a second. Now...HALDEMAN:And, and they say we're, they think we're onvery sound ground because of that. Theywere concerned at one point that there's a circumstantial chain and that if, if intentor willfulness is not required, that wemight have a problem because of the circumstantial chain, but their research of the statutes as of yesterday, convinced themthat that either corrupt...PRESIDENT:Corrupting. HALDEMAN:...corrupt or willful. One statute is corrupt and the other is willful. Onesection. Uh, that, uh, uh, those are required and that they have a very sound case on that basis. They thought, theythought they could carry, they thought theyhad the case even on the circumstantial that they were concerned about it.PRESIDENT:What is the situation with regard to whatDean actually did? You don't even know thathe...HALDEMAN:I don't know.PRESIDENT:I don't think he hid anything with regardto...HALDEMAN:Well, it sure (unintelligible) that hedid-by McCord and some of those people.PRESIDENT:Well, that he meet with then, and deliveredmoney to them?HALDEMAN:He, he had $175,000 that he delivered.PRESIDENT:He did?HALDEMAN:Well, I don't know. That's what McCordsaid. Now, I must say that everything that McCord has said has proven to be accurate orvirtually everything he's said.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.63PRESIDENT:Accurate?HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:And we can get him on the fact that it'shearsay. That it's hearsay seems to...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...from what we pick up the otherdirections, it doesn't seem to be erroneous hearsay.(pause)PRESIDENT:So McCord, McCord says that John Deandelivered him $175,000.HALDEMAN:No, it isn't, it, that isn't that clear. Hesays John Dean--didn't deliver McCord-McCordhas nothing on first hand. It would be that McCord says that Hunt told him or Liddy told him or something like that.PRESIDENT:How Dean, being a lawyer, so smart as he isnow, could have not, have not just--tell everybody not to do this or that or the other thing. S-, he could have gottenhimself so involved in that is more than Ican figure out.HALDEMAN:Maybe he didn't. McCord maybe has awrong...PRESIDENT:No, no. HALDEMAN:...pitch on that, too. PRESIDENT:Right. But how Dean, uh...HALDEMAN:Well, you see Dean told me when he wasworking back through this stuff, he said, "If I can just get--send me to the GrandJury and give me immunity and we have noproblem, because I'm the only one in the White House who has any real problem on this and they--it, itAPRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.64HALDEMAN:would stop at me and if I'm immune it(Cont'd)doesn&#8482;t matter." He said, "It would meanI'd have to leave the White House."PRESIDENT:When did he say this? HALDEMAN:Hmm?PRESIDENT:When did lie say this?HALDEMAN:Somewhere in this period, when we weretalking about the strategy of Dean going to the Grand Jury which was in thatPRESIDENT:Before the 21st (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:No, after. PRESIDENT:But I was not there.HALDEMAN:No, sir.This was probably on the telephone while hewas at Camp David when he was spinning out different routes of how you could work thisout. At least that is what I think. Andhis point then was, "Nobody else has any problem on this but I do. And if I can get immunity, and I can still spin it out whichwill clear everybody else and it stops at meand I have immunity so I don't get hung.&#64258; And then the thing that worried him aboutwas that he said, "I guess that would meanI'd have to leave as counsel.&#64258; But, at that point, he was trying to spin out a plot that would keep him on as counsel.PRESIDENT:No way.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.65HALDEMAN:And as it turned out what he was working onwas a--not a factual thing for you, but anelaborate case of how to pull John Dean outof the soup.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Which is understandable 'cause he was...PRESIDENT:Then he got his attorneys in--his attorneyto go to see the U.S. Attorney. When did his attorneys, (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:I don't know.PRESIDENT:When...his attorneys go to see the U.S.Attorney?HALDEMAN:I don't know...I don't even know if we canfind out.PRESIDENT:When, in other words, did Dean start, uh,--it must have been, uh, uh, March 21st,when we were in California.HALDEMAN:He didn't have an attorney then. It was, itwas on, it was past March 28thPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...when I, had that very long call with him.He didn't have an attorney then.PRESIDENT:Not then, not then--March 28th, then. Wewere in California 'til when? April,uh...Hell. We were in California on March 28th to...HALDEMAN:March 30th to April, uh, 7th, something-9th.PRESIDENT:Yeah, April 9th.HALDEMAN:April 8th, we came back.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.66PRESIDENT:April 8th.HALDEMAN:We were back in the office here then on theninth. And the ninth is when you gotGarment going on--'cause you met with him for a few minutes that day after you metwith Ehrlichman and me.PRESIDENT:When was this, on the ninth? Yeah. Gonnahandle the Committee hearings.HALDEMAN:See that's what we were worrying about.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)still concerned about theCommittee?HALDEMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:Shows on my schedule here John Dean on the16th.HALDEMAN:Of April? PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:That's correct.PRESIDENT:What the hell was that about. HALDEMAN:Well, that was after,--the 15th was the dayyou met with Kleindienst and everybody.PRESIDENT:Oh, that was the resignation.HALDEMAN:You met with Dean the night of the 15th also.PRESIDENT:Un hum.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) in.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:And that was the resignation deal...APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.67PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) the 16th.PRESIDENT:The night of the 15th I guess was when hereported that he had talked to the U.S.Attorneys (unintelligible). April the 16th heshould go, he ought to resign, you know what I mean, that's--you see, let me put it this way,one thing has got to (unintelligible). Bob,you and John are not--there's no way in myopinion that Dean can do a God damned thingmore to you than (unintelligible) fact.(Unintelligible) do anything. I think Dean isgonna do everything he can (unintelligible) anyway. You get my point?HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:So John&#8482;s theory, the President should fireDean's ass out of here, etc., has to beexamined in terms of does that--and this isnot in terms of accepting blackmail. I'm nottalking about immunity. But does thatunnecessarily, unnecessarily, uh, give Dean amotive where he'll go wild against not only Ehrlichman and Haldeman, which he already isdoing, Bob, and will do again, but, to try todrive the White House to account, thePresident. That we've got to look at all theparts and do the best we can not to let thathappen. You see, that's the reason why theidea of, of firing Dean's ass out of here and, frankly maybe put the blame on him for what hedid and didn't do, uh, but it, it wouldcertainly, it would certainly serve areasonable and justified purpose in engagingJohn and you, although it would help one wayor the other, mind you. Well, I mean I don'tthink, I don't think, except for discreditinghim. On the other hand, uh, treating Dean,uh, in and also, in a different way. I mean, not, not in the way in which we give immunity,because we can't. We can't be blackmailedinto immunity from Dean. You know what Imean, he is a (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Yeah.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.68PRESIDENT:And, and the prosecutors don't want to givehim immunity now. That's their decision,not mine. I've told(unintelligible) that.that's up to them. What the question is, the question is, how do you get him to leaveHALDEMAN:Well, that...PRESIDENT:The human factor... HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...(unintelligible)...HALDEMAN:You can't, you can't make an overt move onDean, un--, unless there&#8482;s a, a reason which is a better reason than you have now.PRESIDENT:Let me say, there's a, also (unintelligible)Dean is--I asked Petersen, I said, "What the Christ is the matter with Dean? That he seems to be after you.&#64258; Petersen, ofcourse, said he had (unintelligible) youknow, about Grand Jury leaks and so forth and supplying everything he can.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible),PRESIDENT:I know, I know. But, but, Bob, it's, uh,you know what I mean, it's...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...it's not what a big bomb is in myopinion. Don't you agree?HALDEMAN:I don't know. PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:I don't know. He may have, he may, if he'sgonna see Petersen about a big bomb, it may be a big bomb on Petersen.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.69PRESIDENT:No, but he told me that he would like to seeme in Florida before he made his finaldecisions about pleading self-incrimination,"or whatever I'm gonna do" and but he did say this--he say "I may want to see youbefore I make it.&#64258; I said, "Well John, Ijust I (unintelligible) I said, "Well John, let's see what, how the situation evolves.&#64258; I told Petersen about that, of course, andPetersen's, Petersen said, "Don't see him Isaid, "Fine.&#64258; I says won't see him.&#64258; I said, "Let me worry about that, that's myjob.&#64258; You know what I mean. 'Cause hefigures (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:John. PRESIDENT:And so on and so on. And he--that's it.Right. I can't bring John in. The onlypurpose of bringing John in is--very important. There's a human factor involved here which you've got to bear in mind which,Ehrlichman, you understand, better thanEhrlichman (unintelligible). You got the human factor. Dean's says, and I think, Imean,--according to Petersen, he said, "He'snever gonna be able to express anything but the greatest respect for and even affection for the President.&#64258; Now, I don't knowwhether that is the case that is with othersor not. But, uh,--was Higby's report...HALDEMAN:Same thing.PRESIDENT:What's Ziegler say he said on that?HALDEMAN:Same thing, that he has no, and, you know,that he was trying to give advice to the President a the sense in this thing anddon't let the President get caught in theobstruction of justice type stuff and all that.APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.70PRESIDENT:He told him "Don't let the President get(unintelligible) in obstruction of justice.What do you think he meant by that? I know Iasked you this earlier, but...HALDEMAN:I don&#8482;t know. I, I think that was workingor, his own ass but not in the way of tryingto hurt, trying to hurt the President. I, I think he will use everything he's got except that. I don't think, unless he becomes amadman that, that, is the danger that Iguess you do have to have to possibly contend with but--so the argument there isyou don't want to do anything to to drivehim to becoming a madman but you, in the same point cannot let a record be made of you protecting him.PRESIDENT:No, no. Oh, no, no. But Bob, I am, uh, in,I am in a totally defensible position.HALDEMAN:I think that... PRESIDENT:Everyday I asked Petersen I say, "What dowant me to do with regard to Dean?&#64258; I askedhim what he wanted me to do with regard to Magruder.HALDEMAN:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;PRESIDENT:Huh?HALDEMAN:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;But, that's...PRESIDENT:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;HALDEMAN:Well,...PRESIDENT:I think.HALDEMAN:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.71PRESIDENT:I know.HALDEMAN:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;PRESIDENT:I mean, I, I, I have, I, I don't have, I,I agree. I like your counsel. I agree thathe's a counsel and a friend. But the point isor Dean said that...HALDEMAN:Our lawyers don't even agree with him as acounsel. Our lawyers totally distrust Petersen.PRESIDENT:Yeah, I know. They distrust him. Theydistrust him. But I, but he's all I got Bob,and, uh,--I think though, that Petersen on theother level, other hand, I, I had repeatedthat so often to him I never failed to(unintelligible) we just, we'll just say, "We got that taped, Henry.&#64258; You know, "The EOB'staped, isn't it?&#64258; Okay, I (unintelligible)that way time and time and again. Now, I, Ijust want to understand what the situation ishere. I have not--I'm treating them all thesame. But, I,--I'm gonna wait until I hearfrom you now you gotta get me furtherinstructions, you let me know. That's why Iasked for the report on you and John. And I said, "As far as Dean is concerned," he says,"Well, we're still having talks with him atarm's length.&#64258; I said, "All right," I said,"I, I'm, I'm I just can't make a move, fromthe arm's length (unintelligible)...&#64258;HALDEMAN:Yep. Immunity.PRESIDENT:So, what I'm getting at is--there's the humanfactor. Now the other point that I made isthis. Dick Moore was up to see (unintelligible) today. I went to end theMoore assault. He likes Moore very much,everybody likes Moore. And he said, "Mooreis, who we, we don't see him as a defendant,we see him as a witness.&#64258; He also seesKalmbachAPRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.72PRESIDENT:basically as a witness, rather than a(Cont&#8482;d)defendaant, except on the money stuff. Onthe money he says--the money, uh, anaberration and so forth. But, Bob, everybody&#8482;s gonna be convicted of somethingon the money and that means they're gonna befined, rather than imprisoned. They don't send you to prison, for say violation of campaign laws--spending laws, do they? Yeah.Well, I think that's the case anyway. That'swhat the situation may be or it may not be. Coming aroundHALDEMAN:As I understand it the only person you canhang on violations of campaign spending laws is the treasurer of the campaign. He has the total liability.PRESIDENT:Who is that? Sloan?HALDEMAN:It was Sloan and then it was Glenn Sedam, Iguess.PRESIDENT:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;and Kalmbach spent some money and so forthand so on and so on, but anyway, my point is this, speaking of Moore, there's that and soI'm gratified.RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;HALDEMAN:Right. You can't do anything with that.That's just...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) recollection. HALDEMAN:That's what it is. I--no, no, no, I'm notsuggesting he lied ubt...PRESIDENT:...My point is if you had felt La Costa wasimportant, you could have told me that. It wasn&#8482;t. I mean, you didn't discuss thematter with (unintelligible).APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.73HALDEMAN:Passing...PRESIDENT:A passing reference at La Costa...HALDEMAN:And it was in the same (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:...to the fact--what, that, uh, that, uh, apassing reference to what, to the...HALDEMAN:...need for money.PRESIDENT:Yeah, for the defendants. And how was itleft (unintelligible)?HALDEMAN:I don't remember, I don't remember. I&#8482;m noteven sure I was in on the thing 'cause Idon't remember at all.PRESIDENT:Moore's recollection was something about thefact, well--oh, Rocher-, or JohnEhrlichman's supposed to have said, "Well, let Rockefeller, Mitchell, get Rockefeller, give him half a million dollars, "a typicalEhrlichman crack, you know.HALDEMAN:Which is not bad. PRESIDENT:Not bad. In other words, the money wastalked about and they said, "Gee, that's theway it is," but we're not gonna get into it.HALDEMAN:That's exactly right. That's the line wehad always taken.PRESIDENT:The line, the line we had, uh, you'regetting into except for the fact that my conversation-you better keep the cork in the bottle on this.HALDEMAN:Yeah, but we didn't.PRESIDENT:Huh? HALDEMAN:Yeah, but that they didn't go any further.(Unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:You mean the question (unintelligible)... HALDEMAN:...(Unintelligible).APRIL 26, 1973 FROM 8:55 TO 10:24 A.M.74PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) The other point is that,that on Moore-'I'm gonna ask you--Moore hasbeen very close to Dean. Is there anythingout of the way, I mean. See there's nobody that can talk to him. I can't let Petersengo over-and, how 'bout Moore gets backhaving him just have him say that have a talk with Dean. Keep us there. See what the hell he has in mind. Would it beuseful?HALDEMAN:I don't know. I don't, I don't know whatuh, Moore's position is...PRESIDENT:...position, the position that, uh, uh,that, uh--let me tell you, the only thing we got (unintelligible) Dean (unintelligible). We have one (unintelligible). If he doesn'tget immunity, if convicted, then there'sonly one place where he will ever get any possibility of clemency.HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:That's the other point.HALDEMAN:But I sure wouldn't say that to him. PRESIDENT:Oh, no, no, no. But, I mean, after that,that's gonna be in the back of his head.Absolutely. All right. When we see you again (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:I don't know, I don't know.PRESIDENT:Well, ok...
