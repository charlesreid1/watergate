(Unintelligible) spying. I...PRESIDENT:That's why, uh, that's why, uh, they hiredthis guy in the first place to sweep therooms, didn't they?COLSON:Yes sir. Frankly sir, I haven't got intothe, uh, ultimate details that we want to onthis. But I assume he was hired to protecttheir own offices.PRESIDENT:Well, they better, better have somebody youknow, the, uh, uh, Bob gave them 340 on thechopper. (Unintelligible). The chopper had some guy with McGovern, aides that they have are--they hope the committee bugged--I justhad Bob pick it up.COLSON:Yeah.

You've got a God damnperson over there that's ratting on us.What do you think?COLSON:I think its undoubtedly, O'Brien's group.PRESIDENT:Do you?COLSON:You never know. PRESIDENT:You say who... I don't know who the hell itwould be. Some disgruntled (unintelligible)or somebody planted it.COLSON:Or it could be his secretary. PRESIDENT:Well, secretaries do it, not that you paythem any (unintelligible).COLSON:Sure. There, there's no way you can guardagainst that kind of thing. The only thing you can do is be...PRESIDENT:Be sure the White House has told, youknow...COLSON:Well, I think--oh sure, I mean, that's thekind of thing (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:At least the ones we're going to investigateare. (Unintelligible).COLSON:Oh yeah (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I mean like, ah, the ones we have over thereaccording to (unintelligible) and uh, the Yates girl, Buz Yates, Yates (unintelligible) both worked for Johnson.That's sort of a key that, uh,--Oh, hell,uh...COLSON:Those, those kind of people, I think you cantell a person from the way...PRESIDENT:I, I think so, they don't look that--Well...JUNE 20, 1972, FROM 2:20 TO 3:30 P.M._4COLSON:Yeah. I don't quite know if--might be ableto do it long enough to (unintelligible).(Tape noise) that's the kind of thing youcan never be sure of.PRESIDENT:On this thing here, I, uh, I've got to,well, it's a dangerous job.COLSON:Well, Bob is pulling it all together--thusfar, I think we've done this, I think, I think we've done the right things to date.PRESIDENT:I think the real question is whether, uh, wewant to (unintelligible) the charge-(tape noise) (unintelligible) to hold up.Basically, they all pretty hard line guys.COLSON:Yes, sir. PRESIDENT:If we are going to have this funny guy takecredit for thatCOLSON:You mean the one with the--Hunt?PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible). COLSON:Course I, I can't believe he's involved. Ithink (unintelligible) he's, he's, he's toosmart to do it this way, he's just toodamned shrewd (unintelligible/REMOVED) toomuch sophisticated techniques. You don'thave to get into (unintelligible with tapenoise) heavy equipment like that, put it in the ceiling, hell of a lot easier way.PRESIDENT:It doesn't sound like a, a skillful job.(Unintelligible). If we didn't know better,would have thought it was deliberately butched.COLSON:Yeah, uh, I thought of that this weekend.And, uh, then I, then I figured, uh, maybe it's the Cubans that did it. Organizing it on their own, because you know they had, uh,(unintelligible). (Coughs)PRESIDENT:I just, just feel very strongly.JUNE 20, 1972, FROM 2:20 TO 3:30 P.M._5COLSON:Oh, Jesus. I just talked to Clawson. He saidyou know we should (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I saw a paper when I was in there--it says,Kennedy, uh, public enemy number one forCubans (unintelligible).COLSON:Oh, they're violent. Well you know, Mr.President, most of them keep(unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:I'm anxious to get that, why don't you getthat paper of ah, Rebozo had it on his, uh,desk. It's the last published, the lastissue, I think to the paper. Published, hadto be published (unintelligible) public enemy number one.COLSON:They hate him, of course they hate McGovernbecause they're not used to Kennedy(unintelligible). You know, if we were torecognize Castro and he was the man whoreturned the Cuban Nationals. A lot of theseguys who were, who were, would be consideredfugitives from Cuba--they don't know where toget political asylum.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).COLSON:That's right.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) these days...Jesus Christ.COLSON:Well.PRESIDENT:We pay a price. McGovern would do it in aminute.COLSON:You, he, put yourself in their shoes, when youthink that, uh, that they're sitting herethinking--God that's not what(unintelligible). He may be taken back to afiring squad in Havana. (Unintelligible)resort to some further (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Or the Post, obviously, would be in a hell ofa fight on that, and it will rub off on someothers. I cannot believe that the press is asvicious as it is. Be able to make this an issue, that's uh-- Stay relaxed, you know whatI mean (unintelligible).JUNE 20, 1972, FROM 2:20 TO 3:30 P.M._6COLSON:The Post story is the front page in Bostonthis morning, in the Boston Globe. They'vegot some (unintelligible) large pictures soI called a few people up here this morning, and nobody's seen it. And those who hadseen it said, "Look, (unintelligible).'' I,I don't think people pay attention.PRESIDENT:I read the story. (Unintelligible). But,uh, of course I (unintelligible). What thehell does it prove? That he had-somebody hadyour number in a book, so that's, what the hell does that prove?But...(unintelligible). Probably had mine.COLSON:They had Howard Hunt's number, not mine.(Unintelligible) telephonePRESIDENT:That's right, but Hunt was, uh...COLSON:But you read that story in the paper and youthink they had mine. Now, that was a brilliantly written piece of, uh, political knavery because the first time you read ityou think they had my number and then youread it again and it's Howard Hunt's.PRESIDENT:Know about Howard Hunt's, but how did we getyou in there?COLSON:Well, Howard Hunt was here as a consultantand I wrote an (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Oh yeah. Well, I said to him I don'tsuppose any lawyer from (unintelligible) theguy will get a Pulitzer Prize for this...COLSON:Probably.PRESIDENT:(Laughs). No, no, no, you know what I mean,the guy that broke in...COLSON:Oh, oh. PRESIDENT:...for Christ sakes, they gave the Times thePulitzer Prize.JUNE 20, 1972, FROM 2:20 TO 3:30 P.M._7COLSON:They gave Anderson a Pulitzer Prize. Inother words, stealing documents(unintelligible) for (intelligible).PRESIDENT:Belonging to the Government, top secret,shit, uh, who, did, did any of these peoplesqueal about that then?COLSON:Yeah, isn't that true. PRESIDENT:That's my point. Did McGovern, did theTimes, did the Post squeal about that then?Now here was an attempted theft that failed,against a political party, not against the Government of the United States. They givePulitzer Prizes for publishing stolendocuments. Now let's get at a, I think a hell of a tough speech. (Unintelligible). An article, I mean, let a, a...COLSON:...that's right, if, if you steal classifiedGovernment documents and print them in a newspaper you get a Pulitzer Prize.PRESIDENT:Right. And don't...COLSON:(Unintelligible) political partyheadquarters, uh, you get pilloried.PRESIDENT:That's great, great. Well, and then, too ofcourse, we are just going to leave thiswhere it is, with the Cubans. I hired a detective as being, happens to be the most (unintelligible). Now--COLSON:I think that's (unintelligible) when he wasyounger. (Unintelligible) the picture said he's good. The fact that they had Hunt'sname was the most logical thing in the worldbecause he ran and trained the chief of brigade that went to the Bay of Pigs. He's the fellow that came up and, and cried atJohn Kennedy's office to win such and such awaiver.JUNE 20, 1972, FROM 2:20 TO 3:30 P.M._8PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).COLSON:Bill Buckley is his children's Godfather.He's a very hard, right hard running guy.PRESIDENT:Buckley's the kind to write the story. COLSON:Buckley's the guy who just (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I hope to Christ that he's got(unintelligible) they get Hunt for trying? (Unintelligible) double standard (tape noise). (Unintelligible) I'm not gonna worryabout it. I've (unintelligible) sh-, thehell with it. Well, let me say it flatly&#352; we&#8482;re not going to reach to it that way.we're gonna, we've worked hard on that(unintelligible). What else could we overlook?COLSON:They'll feel sure (unintelligible). Nobasis for that. O'Brie-, O'Brien has suedfor invasion of privacy. That's that's, that's libel in my book. That's libel. That isn't--PRESIDENT:When will that get up?COLSON:Well, they, they brought the suit today, itwas announced they were bringing the suittoday that the attorneys. I don't thinkthat be dismissed for lack of a (unintelligible) But the, the, uh, you know, it's a great Washington story, becauseWashington just thrives on intrigue, andspys and suspense.PRESIDENT:Well, as you know...COLSON:...the political (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Where in the hell (unintelligible), wherethe hell are all these leaks from our side coming from? Now let's put that aside for(unintelligible) Jesus Christ we've got ourplace replace. You know damn well, there, you're, you're either bugged or disloyal orthievery are common par for the course. Youdon't have to deal in proving a bugging count.JUNE 20, 1972, FROM 2:20 TO 3:30 P.M._9COLSON:Of course, the thing we have to guardagainst, Mr. President, is the idea of(unintelligible) on ITT mistake. Now, wewere riding so damned high and I guess we couldn't do much about it but they draggedus into it, but--the press, the media andthe Democrats are so God damn desperate that any issue that they can lay their hands on-- that it's something which normally wouldn'tamount to that much. They're just going toblow their cool out because they haven't got any other place they can lay a glove on US.And that was the case with ITT, which cameafter China, the economy was picking up, wage-price controls were working, they had nothing so they went into ITT viciously.PRESIDENT:Sure. (Unintelligible/REMOVED).COLSON:(Cough) I think they'll try to. You can't,you can't make a case out of this the way you could out of ITT. The weakness in ITTwas that it fed the public suspicion thatthe Republicans are dedicated to big business.PRESIDENT:Yeah, I know, it's $400,000 and all that andso forth. But here it is, they're just trying, let the Committee try to find out what the others are doing (unintelligible).COLSON:I think people expect it. I really do. Ithink they expect it. The trouble isPRESIDENT:Mistake would be what? (Unintelligible).COLSON:Mistake would be to get all of them zeroedin on it.PRESIDENT:Oh. COLSON:Make a big case out of it.PRESIDENT:Oh shit. (Unintelligible) I couldn't agreemore.COLSON:Go after it day in and day out.PRESIDENT:Yeah.JUNE 20, 1972, FROM 2:20 TO 3:30 P.M._10PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:Follow the every--uh, I'd say the hell withit, believe me.PRESIDENT:Yeah, gotta--, and keep your people all awayfrom it. (Unintelligible) like this and I copout. (Unintelligible).COLSON:This is good. This is a (unintelligible).This get's into the media in a way that theywould have acceptedPRESIDENT:That's right. It couldn't be very hard.COLSON:Sure these fellas are just in there trying towin the Pulitzer Prize. He's going at thispretty well--it's going to be a damned effective speech. Apparently was on a T.V.program out in California, state-wide hookup,state-wide program. And, uh, (tape noise)Ellsberg, he didn't know he was having it onEllsberg, and they asked him to comment onEllsberg today and come here today prepared todiscuss the wholesale price of(unintelligible) (laughs and coughs) And Igave a very good opeech and said, "Look, I, that the President is monitoring it himself(unintelligible). Actually, Mr. President, inthis area we've been making, I think, somepretty good progress with the media. It's(unintelligible with tape noise). Now, wellit has taken hold really. And the interestingthing is that the press office, every week, come around asking questions about who's moneywe are (unintelligible) the media this week.PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:It shows they're ner-, I'd say it shows theyare nervous about it. They're, they're...PRESIDENT:Here we have meetings and so forth and so on.So they'll know better next time.COLSON:We, we too, but(Laughs)PRESIDENT:That's right. (Unintelligible). I'm notsaying about itJUNE 20, 1972, FROM 2:20 TO 3:30 P.M._11COLSON:You know, I, I picked up just earlierthis,-- I guess it was yesterday--run downof oral (unintelligible) and published themaround the country as a result of Ken Clawson's attack on the New York Times. Andit's really, ah, it's ah, fascinating, uhstudy, the Dallas Editorial...PRESIDENT:Great. COLSON:...the Detroit News, the, it's run all overthe country, little syndicates picked it up,uh, media critics picked it up, Newsday featured it. He caught them on that one.He really--and this, really hurt them.They're still stinging over that Anthony Lewis story on Vietnam.PRESIDENT:They're still writing that same lousy line,but they're stinging about the story.Your1re right.COLSON:And they're also stinging now about thatimpeachment ad in the New York Times.PRESIDENT:Are they?COLSON:I don't know whether you've noticed it butbut that Common Cause (unintelligible) upagainst, uh against the New York Times andthe sponsors of the impeachment ad.PRESIDENT:On what grounds? Common Cause. COLSON:Yes sir.PRESIDENT:Why?COLSON:Because they, this is their chance to provethat they're (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Fair?COLSON:Fair. PRESIDENT:On what a, what ground?JUNE 20, 1972, FROM 2:20 TO 3:30 P.M._12COLSON:Well, the Times violated the new, the newcampaign spending (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:How did it violate it?COLSON:Because they didn't, they didn't require thepolitical disclaimer which, uh, says thatthis ad is, was paid for or not paid for onbehalf of...PRESIDENT:My guess is the Times would be pretty-- COLSON:No, no they'd have, they'd have to, tocharge them for it.PRESIDENT:What look, well, you know what I mean. COLSON:Oh yeah, yeah.PRESIDENT:That's what they believe.COLSON:If that comes out, uh, we'll, we'll have acase against the New York Times on that quick. The GAO is now investigating theTimes on that... Would be a lovely twist...PRESIDENT:The GAO is... COLSON:...basically... PRESIDENT:Because of this?COLSON:...because of a violation of the campaignspending section.Yeah, they're on, the Times is on very weakground, I think...PRESIDENT:What're they arguing? They just, theyjust-oversite...?COLSON:No, they're gonna argue that it wasn't apolitical ad, yet right in the body of thead was a request for funds for candidates who would vote to impeach you as President.So, they, they don't have much of a defense.Then they'll have to disclose whoJUNE 20, 1972, FROM 2:20 TO 3:30 P.M._13COLSON:paid for the ad. And if it turns out that(cont&#8482;d)that may be traced back to McGovern people,you, you can make this bugging incident lookpuny by comparison, because that ad was placedthe day you left the Soviet Union. And hereyou are coming back from negotiating with a, one of the most important, criticallyimportant meetings in modern history andthey're placing an ad to impeach the Presidentof the United States. If that can be tracedback to McGovern, I think it would, make, uheavesdropping at the Watergate Hotel look likechild's play.PRESIDENT:At times, uh, I just--stonewall it, they'renot gonna...COLSON:Well they haven't, they haven't yet been, uh...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)COLSON:They've just been served now, with the, uh,the request for information so they will haveto start answering. The B6ston Globe, youknow, refused to run that same ad. Uh, that shows you how far out the Times is, Jesus(tape noise). The Times and the Post(unintelligible) they're not supposed to doit. That's different.PRESIDENT:Is anybody over at the Committee--goodintentions I'm sure. All that work, gets upon (unintelligible)--McGovern crowd I suppose.COLSON:It's gonna be a lot of bitterness coming outof the McGovern crowd before it's over. Idon't think we have to go looking for it.(unintelligible) (tape distortion) he, hereally does, a lot of people (unintelligible)that are frightened to death that he could getelected.PRESIDENT:I noticed in reading the news summary today,I, uh (unintelligible/REMOVED) some of thesegoddamned politics are gettin' a littleworried.COLSON:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I don't know. I, uh (unintelligible)JUNE 20, 1972, FROM 2:20 TO 3:30 P.M._14COLSON:It's a, it's a...PRESIDENT:I mean they're worried because they hate myguts so that so. That, that they'reworried...Second ExcerptCOLSON:Keep the (unintelligible) up on our troops,Mr. President.PRESIDENT:Oh sure, and as I said, my goodness... COLSON:We won't let this one bug us, uh,PRESIDENT:Dumbest thing. My God, there are going tobe all sorts of things in the campaign.(15-second unintelligible/REMOVED). Wecan't let this (unintelligible) worldscoming to an end.COLSON:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). This is a development.Nothing loses an election. Nothing changesit that much. (unintelligible).COLSON:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Sure. (Unintelligible/REMOVED).COLSON:(Unintelligible/REMOVED).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible/REMOVED) washes away(unintelligible). And you look at this damnthing now and its gonna be forgotten afterawhile.COLSON:This'll be forgotten and I hope a lot fasterthan ITT.PRESIDENT:Oh sure, you know who the hell is going tokeep it alive. We&#8482;re gonna have a court case and indeed,...the difficulty we'll haveahead, we have got to have lawyers smartenough to have our people de-, delay (unintelligible) avoiding--depositions, of course,JUNE 20, 1972, FROM 2:20 TO 3:30 P.M._15PRESIDENT:uh, are one possibility. We've got--I think(cont'd)it would be a quite the thing for the judgeto call in Mitchell and have a deposition inthe middle of the campaign, don't you?COLSON:I do. I don't think he would. Of course,I'd love to have a deposition, I love tohave a de position taken around here. I'm not--, because nobody, everybody's completely out of it.PRESIDENT:Yeah, I know.COLSON:But--this is, this is once when you'd likefor people to testify.(Unintelligible/REMOVED).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible/REMOVED).COLSON:(Unintelligible/REMOVED).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible/REMOVED).COLSON:(Unintelligible/REMOVED).PRESIDENT:I don't think you should (unintelligible)...COLSON:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:...you&#8482;re an inside man.COLSON:I shouldn't. I'd love to but...PRESIDENT:I'd just stay out of it, uh, all there is toit.COLSON:(Unintelligible). I want (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Oh, should be (unintelligible). COLSON:Yeah. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) could kill him. But I justthink, ya know, sometimes the uh, you mayhave your chance later on. (Unintelligible) how we (tape distortion). The Press(unintelligible) they know goddamn well.(Unintelligible/REMOVED). Well, go rightout and answer these questions for now(unintelligible).JUNE 20, 1972, FROM 2:20 TO 3:30 P.M._16PRESIDENT:"Well Ron, isn't this a terrible thing.&#64258; Shit.COLSON:You know, Mr. President (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I, I tell ya, I didn't have that much to(unintelligible).COLSON:The greatest lesson, uh, those of us aroundyou learn from you. I just, I, I wonder how in other Presidencies (unintelligible) the guts to stay with it. Because it gets toyour morale, personally. (Unintelligible)it does.PRESIDENT:Ya.COLSON:And after it does--I put up with it a dozentimes in the last three years. Every time I do I stop and think "My God, look at what the President has gone through...PRESIDENT:Well...COLSON:...over the years. PRESIDENT:One thing I do...
