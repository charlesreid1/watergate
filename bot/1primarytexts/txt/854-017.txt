Would you keep Gray?COLSON:Yes, sir I would now.PRESIDENT:Now you could send him to the Senate forconfirmation.COLSON:Ah, yep. I would. PRESIDENT:Why?COLSON:Well, because first of all, I-I could backhim up with a very strong Deputy. Ah, because I think if you took Gray out now,with all of the turmoil in the Bureau andevery ah-, the- the everything that's goin' on in that Bureau is being leaked out.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well, how could we stop it?(Unintelligible)COLSON:Ah, by creating certainity. You see, I'mafraidone of the problems of it is that there isn't anybody who knows they'reinsured. Ah, now...PRESIDENT:Who's the Deputy you have in mind? COLSON:Well, I'd suggest that Bill Sullivan is ahhe's ahPRESIDENT:They say he's (unintelligible)... COLSON:oh, he is.

Ah, Haig is very high on Sullivan. Idon't know Sullivan- but I know of so manypeople who do think highly of him, and that those are all the people I.PRESIDENT:In what way (unintelligible)COLSON:No, sir. I don't think so. PRESIDENT:Did they also make your reflection on Gray--Vesco--(unintelligible) investigation ofWatergate appearance?COLSON:Yeah. I think in a way it is. And ah, youmight want to move Gray at the end of theyear, but ah, I'd get through this yearwithout, without rockin' that boat and I would try to got in ah, confirm Gray he's after all-, Gray's loyalty to, to you...PRESIDENT:TotallyCOLSON:Totally. So, give him the strength and backhim up with som- couple people and ah, make sure he- make sure he understands what hehas to do. I mean there- ah, the mostimportant thing over there is to be God damn sure th-that the Department and that Bureauunderstand that ah, we've got enoughtroubles with the Hill without creating any more for ourselves.PRESIDENT:RightCOLSON:And this is a partisan game. This is nolonger Law Enforcement or Investigation. This is part of...PRESIDENT:Sure. What'd you mean, Watergate?COLSON:Watergate. PRESIDENT:Oh, hell, yes. COLSON:And ah, I-I read this.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) partisan press news neverheard of (unintelligible) Ehrlichman. God damn racist. (Unintelligible) everything.(Laughs)FEBRUARY 13, 1973, AT 9:48 TO 10:52 AM3COLSON:Hysterical. But they're gonna make a,they'll have a political circus. Ah, but itis...PRESIDENT:Remember how they built up that poor jackassRalph Landers?COLSON:YeahPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) When he--McCarthy built himup as a great saint, poor bastard. Well, he's an idiot.COLSON:Well...PRESIDENT:He's a sweet guy, Ralph. Landers.(Unintelligible)COLSON:Well, no, lie was nothin'.PRESIDENT:But he took McCarthy out. COLSON:McCarthy's great comment about bring thebutterfly net (unintelligible) (Laughs)PRESIDENT:Oh, God, I wish we had, I wish we had moreof Pat Gray's. Well any way, that's that. Oh, so long- I got (unintelligible). I feel that there's a couple of good guys who workaround here, everyone around here forgetsthe God damn thing in the White House. (unintelligible) (noise). (cough) You justfigure you're gonna have s-, leaks,television, press- and just say that's underneath us. (cough) Ah, ah, how do you feel? Is there anything else you could do?COLSON:Well, the only thing you can do Mr.President.PRESIDENT:I mean if you can't, you've got to get forexample Magruder's operation, lialdeman, andEhrlichman and the rest, Dean,COLSON:Yes PRESIDENT:if they all get into this, they're gonna gothrough the ITT thing (unintelligible)FEBRUARY 13, 1973, AT 9:48 TO 10:52 AM4COLSON:Well, of course, that's what they want to doto us, you know? That's-the whole point ofthat ex-exercise...PRESIDENT:To burn some others COLSON:Correct. Correct.PRESIDENT:Now don't you agree we should stay away?COLSON:I think we have to- I don't think there'sany choice but to, but to go up there and tough it through. And ah, I do think -wehave to be very, very hardnose to thatcommittee. And ah, if they want Haldeman, Ehrlichman, me, I'm sure they will, ah wehave to limit the areas that they're gonnago into, and I mean.PRESIDENT:Well, I'm not sure. The best thing there(unintelligible) you can let them have lowerpeople like, ah, Chapin and Strachan and therest- Hell, I never talked to Chapin and Strachan and the rest- Let them have them, and ah, but in terms of the people that aredirect advisors to the President you can saythey can do it by written interrogatories, by having, uh, Ervin and (unintelligible),ah majority, the two counsel, majority andminority leaders do it- written interrogatories but don't go up there on television.COLSON:Umm hmmPRESIDENT:I'll bet some feel that's a possiblecompromise.COLSON:I think it's a good compromise. Ah, there'sa risk, ya know, but ah...FEBRUARY 13, 1973, AT 9:48 TO 10:52 AM5PRESIDENT:They may not-they may not accept it. Butuh, I don't think- I had thought that maybewe ought to j-just harden and say nobody cango. I'm afraid that that gives an appearance of total cover up, which wouldbother me a bit, ya know, I should just sayno, you can't have Chapin, you can't have Strachan, you can't have, ya-know, and since the White House won't allow anybody-you maylet them have some others. I don't know. Imean maybe we could think about it. I, I Can't get him to talk about it just totestify. That'll break it down toKissinger-break it down to Haldeman and Ehrlichman-can't do that. And ah, of course that's why you can't go- the people thatare, who have direct access to the Presidentcan't- go.COLSON:Well you know the difficulty with it Mr.President? Ah, I've been thinkin' about thisover the weekend, I tried talkin' throughwith one of my ah perceptive law partners, who's a brillant, brillant trial lawyer andhis point was, which I thought was a Goddamn good one, he said, you can't go at all. He says there's nothing in the facts of the Watergate, the Segretti, that you had anyinvolvement in, at all. But they're gonnastart asking you other questions, and and...PRESIDENT:That you were involved in also.COLSON:And, they're gonna com- well, somethingthat I may not even be thinking about right now. But, ah...PRESIDENT:In the campaignCOLSON:In the campaign, sure. Or in the, in thepre-campaign period, and ah, things that have not a damn thing to do with Watergate,or Segretti but, but ah.FEBRUARY 13, 1973, AT 9:48 TO 10:52 AM6PRESIDENT:Well, their license ah, apparently, ah is togo on everything in the campaign.COLSON:Yeah, that's right.PRESIDENT:That's the problem. COLSON:But why should one, wh- ya know, that,that's an area where y-you don- don't, youdon't know where to draw the line. You can't be a little bit pregnant, and ah...PRESIDENT:Well, we'll decide (unintelligible) crossthat bridge till we get to it.COLSON:No. I think you're right in terms of tryingto limit those who have had direct access toyou, because th-that creates a problemAnd...PRESIDENT:I'm sure absolutely. COLSON:I would ah, ah...PRESIDENT:But even there, I mean, based on the(unintelligible), I don't think you can (unintelligible) alone as a certainity at the Chapin and Strachan level, I don't thinkI would go that low.COLSON:No, and I don't think you need to. PRESIDENT:(unintelligible)COLSON:Sure. That doesn't make any difference, letthem do it. And let them take the whole damn committee apparatus. Ah, of course, the other point which I'm gonna mention toHaldeman before I take off is that if- whoever did- order Watergate, ah- if it's gonna come out in the hearings, for God sakes, letit out...PRESIDENT:Step out nowFEBRUARY 13, 1973, AT 9:48 TO 10:52 AM7COLSON:Least get rid of it now, take our losses.PRESIDENT:Well, who the hell do you think did this?Mitchell? He can't do it, he'll perjurehimself so he won't admit it. Now that's the problem. Magruder?COLSON:Ah, I-I know Magruder does.PRESIDENT:Well then he's perjured himself, hasn't he ? COLSON:Probably PRESIDENT:Alright. What'd you say then? Let's takeour losses- who the hell's gonna stepforward and say it? See my point? . You've got it set-Liddy ah, Liddy of course is ah,he directed Watergate. But ah, who do youhave in mind? I mean I'm afraid that can't risk it, Chuck, unless you have somebody in mind.COLSON:No! I-I, w-wellPRESIDENT:My advice, my advice - would you suggestMitchell, go in and say why (unintelligible). This must've occurred, Idid not realize it at the time, but ah...COLSON:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Mitchell seems to have stonewalled it up tothis point (unintelligible).COLSON:Well, he's- ya know, John has got one ofthose marvelous ah, memories that I don't know. I don't remember what was said. Ah.PRESIDENT:I was busy at the time.COLSON:Yeah PRESIDENT:(unintelligible)COLSON:I don't know.FEBRUARY 13, 1973, AT 9:48 TO 10:52 AM8PRESIDENT:That's his point.COLSON:I haven't seen anything yet, related to thiswhole, incident that has not come out oneway or another. And it's just that slow painful process of pulling it out piece bypiece. Ah,PRESIDENT:Of course I want you to believe me on this,Chuck, although it s just being repetitious.COLSON:Oh hell!PRESIDENT:When I'm speaking about Watergate though,that's the whole point of the election this tremendous investigation rests. Unless oneof the seven, begins to talk. That's theproblem.COLSON:But, you never know. You never know. PRESIDENT:Well then the question is as far as theseven, that the only ones that really know,Hunt knows, I would imagine, I imagine Liddy would know. McCord?COLSON:Probably.PRESIDENT:Alright. Go for (unintelligible).COLSON:Well, what my perceptive partner, who knowsSirica very, very well and has tried manycases in front of Sirica, what he thinksSirica will do, at the critical moment is, call in one of them and say, O.K., you don't go to jail if you tell me everything youknow. And ah...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) immunity? COLSON:Make a deal with them, before he sentencesthem.PRESIDENT:Would they accept this?FEBRUARY 13, 1973, AT 9:48 TO 10:52 AM9COLSON:Would they accept it? (draw deep breath) Idon't think Hunt would. Ah...PRESIDENT:You don'tCOLSON:No. No, I really don't, no. I mean I thinkhe's a...PRESIDENT:Extremist?COLSON:Yeah. He's too much of a believer. On theother hand, who knows, ya know. He's lost his wife which was a great source ofstrength to him. He's ah, got four kids.PRESIDENT:Trouble in Hunt's case, which is that, hehas contact with you, Ehrlichman, on othermatters.COLSON:Sure. PRESIDENT:That's the problem you see? COLSON:Sure. But it- but they're not matters thatI'm really concerned about. Ah, so we wentand interviewed someone on ITT, but that's per-perfectly logical as...That's what ya have a fellow like available for.PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:But the, the, ya know, the whole, th-the,the unfortunate part of it is, andyou-you're, it's imperative that people herenot get bogged down in it.PRESIDENT:Yes COLSON:The unfortunate part of it is, that it is adiversion. Ah, th-there's no limit to whatthey can do with it if they wanted-- and the reason you have to hard line it with certainpeople...FEBRUARY 13, 1973, AT 9:48 TO 10:52 AM10PRESIDENT:Umm hmmCOLSON:...is that there is no limit to what theycan do to it in terms of- well, hell, yaknow, even arranging the Democrats for Nixon ads, ah, yeah, we had some technicalviolations of the statute. Ah, a fewmailings that were done by ah, different committees outside of here. Yeah. Those were technical violations of the statute.Somebody (unintelligible) can't. But yaknow, if you wanted to make them into capitol cases, you can.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)COLSON:Sure. Sure, but... PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) COLSON:But the, certainly, but the problem is thatthey're, they're just gonna get the if theycould get Ehrlichman, Haldeman or me, to say under oath that we were aware of anything that was a violation of the statute, thenthey've got a circus on their hands.PRESIDENT:Umm hmm, COLSON:And, ah, either you have to have a JohnMitchell type memory or, (laughs) or notappear.PRESIDENT:Your (unintelligible) would be to letStrachan go, let Chapin go.COLSON:My view is all wrong, always(unintelligible). But, but, but in the case of Haldeman, Ehrlichman and I, ah, the onlythree you can probably do this with, ah,that they should be either written interrogatories or appointive type things where they, they list out some highlyspecific areas. And that's it and notbeyond that. And if they try to get beyond that, you just, you hard-you stonewall it oryou, ah, (sighs) or you just don't remembersomething when you have to.
