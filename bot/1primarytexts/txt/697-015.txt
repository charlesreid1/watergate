3/30/72 NX + HRH 11:52 to 12:15000 PRESIDENT: I must say it's quite different HALDEMAN: I believe it is PRESIDENT: Anyone who believes a thing like that deserves  HALDEMAN: Just been unbelievable. Y&#8482;know. Built himselfup as a little kid. Dedicated. And has become end up the greatest swimmer in worldhistory PRESIDENT: Really? HALDEMAN: Oh. Yeah.and all the rest.  PRESIDENT: Yeah. Well - I was going to suggest that afterI finish these knick-knacks around 12:30, I think it would be good to get Colson and McGregor to come in after you have HALDEMAN: Well, I've--  HALDEMAN: Well, I've covered it with McGregor. I'vetalked to Kleindienst PRESIDENT: Yeah  HALDEMAN: And I've talked to McGregor  PRESIDENT: What'd you say to Kleindienst? HALDEMAN: Well I went through just exactly what we talkedabout with Kleindienst and he said oh hell I didn't mean to imply to McGregor in any way that he should talk to Eastland. Now - I think he did it PRESIDENT: Yeah HALDEMAN: But he backed off of it PRESIDENT: Yeah, yeah &#338; but  HALDEMAN: An I think is that it's just-- in making thedeal with Eastland I can do a better job because, because he likes me better and moves me more-- PRESIDENT: Yeah-2- HALDEMAN: --to put it in its simplest terms PRESIDENT: Yeah, yeah, Right  HALDEMAN: And what I felt that I ought to do that. Ithought it was best understood. PRESIDENT: Yeah  HALDEMAN: But we have a problem that if you want this tobe a relationship where nobody's allowed to talkto Eastland butthat's, that's kind of a problem. PRESIDENT: Yeah, right.  HALDEMAN: And he said o hell no and Clark should be goingwith him -- PRESIDENT: Yeah. HALDEMAN: -- on the.vote counts  PRESIDENT: Yeah, right  HALDEMAN: -- and the technical  PRESIDENT: Right  HALDEMAN: -- all that  PRESIDENT: Good let me call Clark HALDEMAN: No problem on that and when he said I-- thatthere was a story that Marlow Cook was going for a compromise on this thing. And he said I've talked to Marlow Cook about that to see what he's talking about and Cook says that he's solid for a, a, complete termination vote but he feltit would be a good strategy for him to saypublicly that maybe we ought to look into sane compromise on the thing. He&#8482;d certainly think that was a good idea so that it doesn't look like the Republicans are trying to cover up. He said in executive session he would voteuncompromisingly for total termination and hesaid there'll be no problem because the compromise that Teddy will seek will be so outlandish that we can, probably we can just reject that out of hand.I&#8482;ll just say unreasonable.-3- PRESIDENT: Right25  HALDEMAN: Whatever it is  PRESIDENT: Right  HALDEMAN: And so he at least and and McGregor brings thistoo, does, it not concerned about the&#352;- wh-- PRESIDENT: Right. Right HALDEMAN: Wh--  PRESIDENT: Good. That covers the thing  HALDEMAN: his being directly obese and when notMardian being with them and he said I understand that and I willin there PRESIDENT: Good HALDEMAN: And ah I said now tie only other problem thatwe've got to clear up is is there's apparently some thought on Eastland's part that ah ah it would be a good idea for you to continue through the rest of the year as acting Attorney General. Somehow he can't be allowed to go on having thatproblem. And he said I understand that and Idon't think PRESIDENT: Yeah  HALDEMAN: Y' know he's understands it-- misunderstands theoverhand and all that PRESIDENT: Yeah. All right HALDEMAN: But anyway I got that PRESIDENT: You got that and you got  HALDEMAN: I got that  PRESIDENT: Great  HALDEMAN: So he knows that. I said obviously as thePresident made very clear yesterday that'sthat's just a potential that we can't rulepolitically and ah---4-PRESIDENT: Right HALDEMAN: -- he said oh I understand that. And--  PRESIDENT: Right,  HALDEMAN: -- so I went in and talked to Clark.Kleindienst had already talked to Clark on the phone PRESIDENT: Yeah HALDEMAN: -- before I got to him. He had not talked toEastland yet, so this, this PRESIDENT: Right  HALDEMAN: Eastland. Kleindienst  PRESIDENT: You talked to Clark. HALDEMAN: I talked to Clark and Clark said there's ah, Iunderstand all that and that's fine. And he said and there-- we talked through the whole thing. I said this what Klein-- Kleindienst and he said I agree. Kleindienst is the better guy to cut the deal with Eastland. Eastland does, is suspicious of me. On the other hand ah if myhands are to be tied and I'm not to do anythingexcept be anI said they're not to be and said the President -Oh. I hit Kleindienst on that pretty hard. I said that, see, Clark's problem, Dick, is that it's his view that he's the President's Congressional PRESIDENT: Right HALDEMAN: -- that he has an assignment from the President- RRight  HALDEMAN: -- which is to deliver the confirmation  PRESIDENT: That's right  HALDEMAN: That&#8482;s where we&#8482;re crossed. PRESIDENT: Right HALDEMAN: Now there're some prices which we can take indelivering that but you don't know a goddam thing about it-- PRESIDENT: Right-Right HALDEMAN: -- and shouldn't and never will  PRESIDENT: S&#8482;right  HALDEMAN: We've got a Senator who wants a Veteran'sHospital and we may give it to him. PRESIDENT: S&#8482;Right HALDEMAN: And we've got another Senator who wantssomething else-- PRESIDENT: Right  HALDEMAN: -- wants something taken out of the record, andwe may take it out PRESIDENT: Right HALDEMAN: But that&#8482;s nothing to do with justice-- PRESIDENT: Right  HALDEMAN: -- you don't know a damn thing about it?  PRESIDENT: Right&#8482;s time  HALDEMAN: But Clark does  PRESIDENT: Right  HALDEMAN: -- and do you really wanta pull Clark outa that?And he said well-- and I said I also understandthat you talked to Clark last week and made the point that you were counting on him to deliver the ah, PRESIDENT: Yeah  HALDEMAN: ...confirmation... PRESIDENT: Yeah HALDEMAN: ...and he says that's right  PRESIDENT: Yeah. Rightj  HALDEMAN: Absolutely  PRESIDENT: Good  HALDEMAN: So that's all cleared. I covered that all withClark. He said fine. I he says maybe I over-reacted but I&#8482;d&#352; PRESIDENT: Yeah- Yeah  HALDEMAN: I said well it probably woulda but I'll get itcleared up. I just want you-- And he said I'm not asking-- I said-- I'm not asking you to do anything I just want you to know what my problemis here so that you're PRESIDENT: Good  HALDEMAN: has to go down the track on that  PRESIDENT: Great. Great.  HALDEMAN: -- and I'll take care  PRESIDENT: I just don't want Clark to feel we-- we'retrying to-- HALDEMAN: When we finish when I finished with Clark I saidhe said ah I don't wanna rush you out but I do have the President's 12 o'clock appointment waiting. Maybe I oughta go catch him and ah, ah PRESIDENT: Sure. Yeah 59 HALDEMAN: I said, ah, fine but ah, maybe ,maybe we oughtto go down and see the President and just make sure this is all cleared up. He said, if the President wants to that's fine if there's any concern in his mind.-7- PRESIDENT: Right, right HALDEMAN: But, he said you clear everything up I have no need to see the President. PRESIDENT: Right  HALDEMAN: So that&#8482;s where that is. Now, in the meantimeyou should note, MacGregor just told me this,that Colson after McGregor, Colson and I metthis morning, Colson got McGregor aside and said I want you to join with me in a private memo I'm sending the President urging that Kleindienst withdraw now. And McGregor said, I will not join in that, I don't want to be on record andthat it isn't any of my business and Colson saidyeah I noticed you waffle in (?) the President's office on that point the other day. And, ah, McGregor said well waffling(?) may be what you'd call it, I hadn't thought about it. My assignment is to get the nomination confirmed and that's what looking at and I haven't-- myfirst assignment was get the ah, the hearingsterminated and that&#8482;s what I&#8482;m working on. PRESIDENT: Right  HALDEMAN: I ambeyond that as to what ought to bedone and when the President asked me I said I hadn't thought about it. PRESIDENT: But does Colson have a new scheme(?) HALDEMAN: I don't know. I'll see his memo that, ah PRESIDENT: Well, we don't need to have memos written toeach other. HALDEMAN: This is this is a point. PRESIDENT: Yeah HALDEMAN: And McGregor said, I don't, he said McGregorsaid look PRESIDENT: Is McGregor, will he  HALDEMAN: There are numerous...  PRESIDENT: Kleindienst out and oh Kleindienst right now canwithdraw. HALDEMAN: Well, I can&#8482;t-8- PRESIDENT: Do you think so? HALDEMAN: No  PRESIDENT: Does Colson think so?  HALDEMAN: I think  PRESIDENT: I asked this point, I asked about  HALDEMAN: Colson's back on his scare tactic again of thememos that, from, there's a memo from, ah, ahMcLaren to Ehrlichman er, all those things, we've heard about &#8218;em before. PRESIDENT: Yeah  HALDEMAN: And he said, he told Clark about &#8218;em, he said Ihadn't told you about them before 'cause Ididn't think you should know they were there andI haven't told the Attorney General or Kleindienst because if they're called on the witness stand they shouldn't know these exist PRESIDENT: Right, right  HALDEMAN: But they're there and we've got to terminate thehearings in order to avoid these things comingout. And then, I think he's now arguing thatmaybe with the hearings terminated, that Kennedy in his frustration will find some way to get these out if he or find out about them if he doesn't know about them if he doesn&#8482;t know about them which I can't imagine that he does, and get&#8218;em out some other way. Ah PRESIDENT: Yeah  HALDEMAN: If we can keep Kleindienst up for confirmation.Now, my answer to that would be, they don't give a shit whether Kleindienst is confirmed or not PRESIDENT: They'll take what they're going to get(?) HALDEMAN: They're going to get those out, they're going toget them out anyway.-9- PRESIDENT: Well, the fact that weColson forgetsKleindienst is not the issue. They want to get this stuff out. They, they're going to get it out one way or the other anyway-but they have the information. HALDEMAN: If they know about it, they'll get it out andour terminating the hearings isn't gonna stop&#8218;em-- withdrawing the name just isn't gonna stop &#8218;em PRESIDENT: Yeah. Well, can't I can't urge you to do thison Colson. You get him immediately while I'm going through the rif-raf today, 'cause you knowhe's been a hell-of-a loyal soldier here, saynow Chuck, you're to take off 3 days and, there's another thing too you've got to get understood here that either whatever he called you memoranda and so forth and a lot of things these days, mideast and so forth that HALDEMAN: Um hum PRESIDENT: Bob, I'm spending an inordinate amount of mytime talking to Colson, talking to McGregor, talking to you about these goddamned hearings. It's wrong. There isn't a thing that I can do that's gonna effect and also I shouldn't knowthis much about it. HALDEMAN: Sure.  PRESIDENT: I just feel that I shouldn't. Now you know whatI mean is that I, ah I think that, I think what oughta happen here is that everybody oughta do their goddamn best to, you know, to to work outa strategy and then if I have to be brought in &it, I will do it but HALDEMAN: yeah  PRESIDENT: I think what is happening is that it's partly myfault, I gave Chuck a call once or twice-10- HALDEMAN: Well, you're interested. PRESIDENT: I'm interested butgoddamed thingbut Ithink we're too close to it. I think Chuck's too close to it of course [phone rings] there's stuff out there. So it comes out that he wrote him a letter. So, so far example Kleindienstsubmits that people are going to be worriedabout whether he, what his letter to Larry O'Brien said. They aren't going to give a shit. HALDEMAN: That's the point.  PRESIDENT: You see the point?  HALDEMAN: Yeah, and if all that comes out it's gonna comeout anyway. PRESIDENT: But Chuck, but Chuck's point is that what--Kleindienst now resign or, or withdraws his name, on what grounds? HALDEMAN: There's no way.  PRESIDENT: On what grounds?  HALDEMAN: Before the Committee terminates, he can&#8482;twithdraw. If the Committee terminates, he sureas hell can't withdraw. PRESIDENT: That's right  HALDEMAN: The only place that he can and may have to, isif the Committee bogs down or if the Committee continues PRESIDENT: If the Committee continues, then he should sayit's clear that I can not be confirmed. I withdraw my name. But I don't want Chuck leaking that to the press. You understand? HALDEMAN: Yup  PRESIDENT: That's what we've got to avoid here. HALDEMAN: Yup PRESIDENT: That will, that will get it to a place whereKleindienstas a matter of face. Has to stay in, Chuck has got to, he's can't, he can't talk toso many people. HALDEMAN: yeah  PRESIDENT: Ah, now can I ask you to, now, I'll talk to youat 12:30. I want you to talk to Chuck and say, you're doin' a great job here, we're on exactlythe same track, but we've got to work it outbetter. Does Chuck now that we&#8482;ve been, can he guess is that's what the hell I was talking to Kleindienst about? HALDEMAN: But he knows it.  PRESIDENT: About his withdrawal? HALDEMAN: Sure. Because they know, you know, we, youtalked to (P & H talking at same time)P...writing a memorandum  HALDEMAN: They both know that's what it was about.  PRESIDENT: What's the purpose  HALDEMAN: I made the point to both of them  PRESIDENT: What's the purpose of the memorandum? HALDEMAN: They just don't wanta know what it was about,obviously they do but they don't want to so they forget about it. They don't know. PRESIDENT: In fact (?) the meeting never took place.That's what they should know. This meeting never took place. No, you can't say that. HALDEMAN: Well, it doesn't matter. There's no reason PRESIDENT: But my point is, I do feel, I do feel thatChuck, there's got, you've gotta get him off the kick that he figures he's a lobby (?), you know he's, you know, he's a fighter. God bless 'em but. He's fighting Mardian on this too. He'salso fighting Mitchell. You see what I mean,and he thinks that other people are taking different views.-12- HALDEMAN: Well they are. PRESIDENT: Mardian may be. I think though thatKleindienst now knowsvery damned well what we have to do. Doesn't he? HALDEMAN: Yes.  PRESIDENT: Does he know HALDEMAN: He laid the groundwork for doing it. He, he putinto thewhich I kind of explained this to McGregor, I said the other point here is, we're better off with Kleindienst knowing that these hearings have to be terminated, it's his ass too now. PRESIDENT: yeah. HALDEMAN: Cause he is commited that they will beterminated. PRESIDENT: That's right.  HALDEMAN: That he's to cut the deal with Eastland to getit done. Now that's up to him to do. PRESIDENT: That's right. HALDEMAN: Now obviously that doesn't preclude you workingin every possible... PRESIDENT: No  HALDEMAN: way you can to get &#8218;em cut off.  PRESIDENT: I want you to talk to Chuck and say now that'swhat we're trying to do. If the hearings arenot terminated, Chuck, it's another game. Butnobody's to breathe a thing. But we haven't got a provacation whereby Kleindienst can say today that he can do it. And tell Chuck that that, that he's got to know that HALDEMAN: Chuck'swith that line. PRESIDENT: Is, huh, what well Chuck's got to know that hisidea is full of shit. That he says they aren't, if I'm not confirmed in two weeks, or three weeks I will resign. That will not work. That I know is wrong. I mean it's a game which will not play. You agree with that?-13- HALDEMAN: yup. I do.134  PRESIDENT: But he doesn't, right?  HALDEMAN: I don't think he does  PRESIDENT: Ah right  HALDEMAN: I hit him on that again this morning. I saidthat is out of, out of the ball park PRESIDENT: yeah  HALDEMAN: We're not -That's not under consideration at allHe didn't argue with me PRESIDENT: It just can't work. On the other hand, in otherwords, when it's gotta be done, it's gotta bedone searchfully, you can't say I'll do it inthree weeks. You've gotta say I am out. HALDEMAN: Uh--  PRESIDENT: Y'see, so he's a lame duck when he says threeweeks. HALDEMAN: Chuck--  PRESIDENT: Now-- HALDEMAN: Plus he gives them three weeks PRESIDENT: yeah  HALDEMAN: ...of high level attentions to throw all theirshit out at him. PRESIDENT: That's right. S&#8482;right. Now that's the otherthing. So I say to them, that's --I say, nowthe second thing is we&#8482;re gonna now he can&#8482;t cutlistening off. If it isn't cut, then Kleindienst may have to move, and I'm perfectly prepared to do this. In other words&#352; HALDEMAN: And you told Kleindienst-14- PRESIDENT: Yeah. I really think that we're gonna have toreally rub John Mitchell's nose in this. Uh we&#8482;ve really got to get Kleindienst if if if they screw around this, in this hearing and we don't get it cut off, then Kleindienst has to go. Now the point that Chuck has if, if, ifthey do cut off the hearings he said wellthey've gonna get it out anyway as long as Kleindienst's name is up there. The point is that, they&#8482;re going to get it out anyway whether his name is up there or not if they're going to get it out. HALDEMAN: If they have it and they want it out they'll getit out. PRESIDENT: That's right.  HALDEMAN: Kleindienst is not a factor in it,  PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right.  HALDEMAN: No question.  PRESIDENT: On the other hand, I think that I should be onestep removed now. I think you'll agree-- HALDEMAN: Yeah  PRESIDENT: -- from this whole goddam controversy. I, I'vegot to have Kleindienst-- I've got to the word here, I don't want to see the damn memorandum on this damn thing. I don't want onefloating around in here, this memorandum. It'llbe in the Washington Post in a few days.Probably and might well be. HALDEMAN: I'll tell them not to send the memo--  PRESIDENT: Yeah.  HALDEMAN: (directly) PRESIDENT: Yeah, yeah. Tell them HALDEMAN: -15- PRESIDENT: (Right/write) a memorandum on it. We knowexactly what we're doing here. We know what we have to do. But we must-- there's too much talk. And, and ah, now do you think I should get Chuck in? 0h that? Ah right. You get him in now and you have a good talk to him and say,look, we've all in the same track here. Thequestion is: What are you gonna do, put in the memorandum? We don't want one filed. He's gotta give it to a secretary and he'll show it to Wally Johnson. You know how it is&#352;- he-- muscle up, he-- HALDEMAN: Yeah PRESIDENT: You agree?  HALDEMAN: Yep  PRESIDENT: I don't need to see that. I know what thesituation is. I don't think that Kleindienst can be confirmed either, I don't think his(Vrick)is going to work. But on the otherhand-- HALDEMAN: You don't know it isn't.  PRESIDENT: Yeah, there's a chance. Lemme tell you theother thing. And this is you realize. If I dump Kleindienst over his objections and over Mitchell's objections... HALDEMAN: So what? PRESIDENT: ...the difficulty is, and over Eastland'sobjections, and his friends?-- he's got friends too. A hell of a lot more friends then the White House staff has got, Bob. That's the thing we've gotta realize. That's-- HALDEMAN: That&#8482;s... PRESIDENT: Now--  HALDEMAN: ...that's natural.-16- PRESIDENT: -- you understand? Now if I do that, then I'm ina hell of a bad spot. If, on the other hand-- HALDEMAN: You won't get an Attorney General.  PRESIDENT: Yeah. They aren't going to approve anybody.  HALDEMAN: That's right.  PRESIDENT: They'd say well screw you. Why should we getMcGregor, if we're gonna send McGregor HALDEMAN: Or whoever it is  PRESIDENT: That's right. The second part. If on the otherhand I set it up so that Kleindienst himself concludes as a result of some prodding from me, that his staying in the race&#352;--17- HALDEMAN: S&#8482; right PRESIDENT: is going to cause more problems than it solves.The whole thing changes. Y'see the point? HALDEMAN: Sure.  PRESIDENT: If this is what Chuck is blind to...  HALDEMAN: There's no rationale that you could set that upfor him to take any action now. Plus if it'sdesirable, we just PRESIDENT: That's  HALDEMAN: look ridiculous if we pulled out now  PRESIDENT: This week what's the hurry? How can he do itthis week? HALDEMAN: The Committee's already PRESIDENT: And also  HALDEMAN: It's gonna terminate its hearings next week  PRESIDENT: That s right. Well. Then they'll vote. Butthe point is if he did it this week do you think they're gonna say, they're gonna say he's doing in (crying) and so forth. And also it wouldmean an enormous public reaction and so forth and so on HALDEMAN: Sure  PRESIDENT: He's gotta do it at the time that there is someaction. First, the committee may not terminate. Then Kleindienst should say I'm getting out, I,I think, that's what has to happen. If thecommittee does terminate and then there is an inordinate delay in the C-- Senate and Kleindienst --&#352;we&#8482;ve gotta set the date in own mind. It's got to say after two (or) three weeks, it&#8482;s clear that I cannot be confirmed andwill not be confirmed because they will notallow a vote and under the circumstances I am asking the presidant to withdraw my name. Fair enough. Is that to handle it? HALDEMAN: Yes.  PRESIDENT: Then Kleindienst is out. If, if for example Ihear this Hoover(type) it wasn't somebody else--it was I who raised the point Bob, that we should, Dick, maybe, maybe, Kleindienst oughta get the hell out. Now you remember at the meeting. HALDEMAN: Yeah  PRESIDENT: And uh HALDEMAN: You were convinced of it at one point. PRESIDENT: And, and, well then nobody said  HALDEMAN: Nobody felt that. Nobody else...  PRESIDENT: Nobody thought so. Well, the more I think aboutit, that will not work unless it's set up so that he, uh so that his friends will be ,let meput it this way, he's got to have a fair shot&#352;-18- HALDEMAN: Right PRESIDENT: -- at the chance of confirmation. Do you agreeor not? HALDEMAN: Right and then he's gotta be a true martyr--  PRESIDENT: I think he's gotta be a time martyr  HALDEMAN: and his friends have gotta rally behind us PRESIDENT: Right. HALDEMAN: -- who rallied behind him  PRESIDENT: S'right, But we've got -- up to this point.  HALDEMAN: Sure. PRESIDENT: And as far as Chuck'sit'stoexpect that getting Kleindienst out is going to make any difference in terms of whether this information comes out. HALDEMAN: S&#8482;right  PRESIDENT: If the information (that comes --) Getting himout will, it won't, it won't mean, mean it won'tget as much publicity if he's out of thepicture. You know what I mean? HALDEMAN: S&#8482;right.  PRESIDENT: They'll say, well, what the hell, They'rebeating a dead horse, that sort of thing. HALDEMAN: I agree with that. PRESIDENT: On the other hand, right now, the whole Kennedycrowd is working on this thing. HALDEMAN: I think that's right-- all the way.  PRESIDENT: Would you talk to Chuck now?  HALDEMAN: yup.  PRESIDENT: And, and, tell him about the-- the main thing isto, they all gonna been shakey and they want tobe reassured. They worked their ass off, HALDEMAN: You mean they're, they're--  PRESIDENT: They're soEverybody is, and they do.They worked and they've been slaves and they're been loyal, so you tell him, goddamit, thePresident is counting on you for help on a lotof things other than this thing. And because we feel there's a hell of a lot and he'll say this is the biggest thing and this is gonna be-- y'know, if, if we stop &#8218;em on this we may stop'em on other things. Forget it,-Stennis is gonna be investigating the War Power,you know that. That's,that's politics, nothing&#8482;sgonna stop them. Not a goddam thing. Now, in, infairness too, we&#8482;ve gotta say this about Chuck&#8482;s new.We've really given him his head in the last three orfour, three weeks on this. And this is going to break, that's gonna break HALDEMAN: Nothing's definite. PRESIDENT: We got all this, and he says we got this thing here.Dita Beard's testimony will break it, which suggestedmaybe that'll break and that&#8482;s not all? And, ah, we got thisAnd that's gonna change it and-- HALDEMAN: Exactly like him. He was always right on the brink-- PRESIDENT: Yeah HALDEMAN: -- of ending the Vietnam War, for years. PRESIDENT: That's right, And basically none of them has met notan issue HALDEMAN: That'; right, PRESIDENT: But (this exterminates)--it happens to be that this is the case where wehaven't gotten a break and we arn't gonna get one,and you know it and I know it. Isn't this true? Onthe other hand-- HALDEMAN: Oh-- PRESIDENT: I--  HALDEMAN: I'm not convinced that we won&#8482;t get the final break.I still think it could very well be that this gets tothe Senate floor they may end up confirming it PRESIDENT: But let me say this. The other thing is this that looking at it basicallythe job that Colson and I and you have and McGregorhas, when we're fighting on their battleground HALDEMAN: Only lose. PRESIDENT: We&#8482;re not losing, We don&#8482;t make any ground. We&#8482;vegot to get the word out. Now I know Colson probablyread the news summary this morning and says ohChrist. The two networks had stuff on it and T. Sothey did. HALDEMAN: Wasn't that--  PRESIDENT: Was about Geneen, right? HALDEMAN: That was all right. It was pretty good. PRESIDENT: But the point that I make is this-- what was moreimportant was that three networks had Connally in thelead and how the hell do we set that up? I set that up with Connally, by sitting down and standing (inthe top) as I should have with him, and suggestingthat he meet with these people and he went out andhad a press conference and he put all those-20-meat packers out there at 6 O'clock at night andevery network ran it. Now what do you think of that? HALDEMAN: That's a matter of much more concern to muchmore people-- PRESIDENT: Exactly HALDEMAN: than PRESIDENT: And Charlie Colson knows that, you see what Imean? Now he's, we've got to work on these things, just gotta quit worrying about this thing and that thing and how this is affecting us, you know what I mean. HALDEMAN: That's, uh-- great PRESIDENT: And also it affects, basically it it defers allof our offensive actions. Remember I said, we oughta hit, ought hit the lost of thing, food price thing we ought to hit the bussing thing, and we oughta hit the President's demand HALDEMAN: We oughta be hitting Meany, too, now. PRESIDENT: And kicking Meany in the ass and that has reallytaken by the wayside, hasn't it? HALDEMAN: No.  PRESIDENT: No, but I mean as far as we are concerned  HALDEMAN: What I'm doing now that's right.  PRESIDENT: They&#8482;re editorials hung high HALDEMAN: That&#8482;s right, but we'll get to PRESIDENT: What about our people? I mean By God, we oughtabe-- the people that some of those guys should be writing speeches kicking Meany in the ass HALDEMAN: Right, PRESIDENT: I mean, and let's break ass about it HALDEMAN: We got, we got a, on Meany they re pulling allthe AFL-CIO people off of the productivity council so that's fine. And not only don't want to help stop the price rise, they don&#8482;t want to even help increase labor's productivity. PRESIDENT: Well, they did say. I noticed for example, uhChuck had four people come into the uh the same dinner and none of them had HALDEMAN: Oh, really?  PRESIDENT: Yeah. However uh, is the building trade issuestill sitting around HALDEMAN: Not much more PRESIDENT: No more than that's all you ever had-21- PRESIDENT: All we ever had HALDEMAN: on the average  PRESIDENT: All we ever had was...  HALDEMAN: You take a stab but you lost on that you got agood ending and you gotta use it, PRESIDENT: That's right but after you finish with Chucklet's do that little talk on it HALDEMAN: OK  PRESIDENT: -- and, let's say look we're on the same, butkeep me one step removed from it, uh, did HALDEMAN: Yeah  PRESIDENT: -- that I have been spending more time on itthan I should HALDEMAN: Yeah, but I think you oughta say that,  PRESIDENT: Yeah  HALDEMAN: -- that you, that, that...   HALDEMAN: ...we're getting to the point where we just--you better take a step back from it, and... PRESIDENT: Yeah, HALDEMAN: then, then we all oughta be moving on to some ofour ground.
