IN THEOVAL OFFICE1MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT NIXON, MITCHELL AND EHRLICHMANON OCTOBER 8, 1971, FROM 10:40 A.M. TO 10:46 A.M.MITCHELL:Mr. President, two other quick things if youhave another moment.PRESIDENT:Sure. MITCHELL:We have those, uh, tapes, logs and so forthover in Mardian's safe on that backgroundinvestigation, wiretapping we did on Kissinger's staff, the newspapermen and so forth. Hoover -uh, those were given toMardian by Sullivan before he left.EHRLICHMAN:We have all the FBI's copies. MITCHELL:Yeah. Uh. Hoover is tearing the place upover there trying to get at &#8218;em and, uh, ofcourse the defense is that Mardian, Mardian has them because you directed him to have them. The question is, should we get themout of Mardian's office before Hoover blowsthe safe or, and bring lem over here and put lem in John's custody -I think John's custody, which I think would be theappropriate thing to do because they're partof the overall investigation of uh, the Pentagon Papers and this whole mess.EHRLICHMAN:My impression from talking to Mardian isthat. Hoover feels very insecure without having his own copy of those things because, of course that gives him leverage withMitchell and with you...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...and because they're illegal. Now, hedoesn't have any copies and he has agentsall over this town interrogating people, trying to find out where they are, -He's got Mardian's building under surveillance -PRESIDENT:He doesn't even have his own, uh --2MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT NIXON, MITCHELL AND EHRLICHMANON OCTOBER 8, 1971, FROM 10:40 A.M. TO 10:46 A.M.EHRLICHMAN:Now, see, we've got &#8218;em. Sullivan sneakedTem out to Mardian.PRESIDENT:Now why the hell didn't he have a copy, too? EHRLICHMAN:If he does, he'll beat you over the headwith it.MITCHELL:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Oh. MITCHELL:I think that it's very well structured whereit is, but the imp--, the...EHRLICHMAN:He's got (unintelligible) MITCHELL:...crunch, the crunch is that they shouldn'tbe in Mardian's hands because he wouldsuspect what Mardian might do with them vis a vis Hoover.PRESIDENT:Mardian's in Justice, you've gotta get themout of there. Do we have them in my hands,then?MITCHELL:Sure, sure. PRESIDENT:Why don't we just say the President wantsthem in his own hands and I'm getting,trying to get some from Helms in my own hands. Why don't we say it that way? AndHoover knows damn well I'm not going to doanything.MITCHELL:Well, Hoover won't come and talk to me aboutit. He just got his, uh, G-, Gestapo allover the place.PRESIDENT:Yeah. MITCHELL:If, if he does, I'm just gonna say they'reover here.PRESIDENT:Who will, who will, who will do this.You've got in mind?3MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT NIXON, MITCHELL AND EHRLICHMANON OCTOBER 8, 1971, FROM 10:40 A.M. TO 10:46 A.M.EHRLICHMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:Just say that we want them. Put them in aspecial safe.EHRLICHMAN:I've got, I've got a place I can put &#8218;em.PRESIDENT:But not to mention, you tell Hoover.EHRLICHMAN:No, I, I would say that if we don't tellHoover anything. If Hoover comes to John which is what Mardian's been telling him todo...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...then John can say the President has themand, Justice.MITCHELL:That'll, that'll turn him off. PRESIDENT:RESTRICTED-&#64257;B&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:PRESIDENT:MITCHELL:Mr. President, Mr. Hoover is tearing up thatdamn place over there and, uh, we have, as I know it's a difficult problem. Uh, but Iwant to tell you that I've got to get himstraightened out which may lead to a hell of a confrontation unless we find another say...PRESIDENT:Yeah.MITCHELL:...because he has practically shut offMardian from the Bureau...4MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT NIXON, MITCHELL AND EHRLICHMANON OCTOBER 8, 1971, FROM 10:40 A.M. TO 10:46 A.M.PRESIDENT:I understand.MITCHELL:...and uh,, I don't know how we go about it,whether we reconsider Mr. Hoover and his exit or whether I just have to bear down onhim. Lead to a confrontation or what, uh --PRESIDENT:Well, as I told you, I will start off thatpractice. He says think it's right. He says I know whenever you -you've gotta getre-elected (unintelligible). If you thinkthat my presence is going to be really harmful, he says, I will resign. That's apretty, pretty nice way of saying I don'tthink I am harmful. He was talking about his support on the Hill and so forth and so on.MITCHELL:Well, sure.PRESIDENT:Uh, as of the moment that is true that heoughta resign, for a lot of reasons he oughta resign, in my view is he oughtaresign while he's on top, before he becomesan issue in the current, the least of it is he's too old.MITCHELL:He's getting senile, actually.PRESIDENT:He should get the hell out of there. Now itmay be, which I kind of doubt, I don't know, maybe, maybe I could just call him in andtalk him into resigning.MITCHELL:Shall I go ahead with this confrontation,then, on this uh availability of the agentsand their material?PRESIDENT:Sure. MITCHELL:...and the Secret Service. PRESIDENT:I think you should --MITCHELL:I think we should.PRESIDENT:And then -well, let's, let's run that by(unintelligible, with noise) then. Well,5MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT NIXON, MITCHELL AND EHRLICHMANON OCTOBER 8, 1971, FROM 10:40 A.M. TO 10:46 A.M.I mean, I'm willing to take it on if we haveto do it. There, there, there're someproblems in it I mean, the day Hoover goes, why he goes out -you see, it's like allthese people that say, well, the hell, theyhave got Agnew, change and, and a certain area poll shows that Agnew at the present time would be liability more than an assetat a certain period of time. We know thatAgnew can't leave that ticket unless he does. Can&#8482;t do it. And the same is true ofHoover -if I fired Hoover, if you thinkwe've got an uprising and a riot now (unintelligible with noise) would be terrific Edgar Hoover has got to go. If hedoes go, he's got to go of his own volition-that's what we get down to, and that's why we're in a hell of a problem. And at the present time, I don't think, John, I thinkhe'll stay until he's 100 years old. Ithink he loves it.MITCHELL:I think he's just a --PRESIDENT:He loves it.MITCHELL:He'll stay til he's buried there.Immortality. The way he's, the way he's handling that department -uhPRESIDENT:Yeah.MITCHELL:...this, this stuff's gonna break... PRESIDENT:Yeah.MITCHELL:...around it.PRESIDENT:Well, can I, uh, can we do, uh(unintelligible) I'm willing to fight him, but I don't. You see, I think we've got toavoid the situation where he -he could leavewith a blast that is (unintelligible) I don't think he will. I think he's so damnpatriotic and he knows very well that(unintelligible)...MITCHELL:He's not, he's not gonna blast us.6MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT NIXON, MITCHELL AND EHRLICHMANON OCTOBER 8, 1971, FROM 10:40 A.M. TO 10:46 A.M.PRESIDENT:...for us, but I'm, on the other hand, youcan't have him go out of there mumbling.What do you want to do? I mean, if you think you want him out, I'll play the game withyou, to get him in here and --MITCHELL:You feel that he, he will not take thescenario that we've talked about for the big hurrah on January 1,...PRESIDENT:Well.MITCHELL:...let's say, with somebody in there in themeantime.PRESIDENT:I sorta, I went all round with him. I saidit might be better to do that, trying to start at the other end. Just couldn't run the risks with the election.MITCHELL:Maybe we oughta let, maybe we oughta letsome of these Indians loose over there and start tearing &#8218;em up a little bit.PRESIDENT:Well, maybe a friend of his in the pressoughta write that. They've got the guts todo it. A Dick Wilson, people like that. Hoover oughta do this at the peak of hiscareer. In other words, it's like LouGerhig and all the great guys you know -Bob Feller -the ones that you remember, are the ones, you know, who didn't play that extrayear. They struck out. They got out TedWilliams didn't (unintelligible)MITCHELL:Is there any such person that's that closeto Hoover?PRESIDENT:Damned if I know. EHRLICHMAN:The, uh -our, our time frame,- I think, isvery tight because of Sullivan is sittingout there and with a hell of a lot ofinformation.7MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT NIXON, MITCHELL AND EHRLICHMANON OCTOBER 8, 1971, FROM 10:40 A.M. TO 10:46 A.M.MITCHELL:I wonder if DeLoach could go and talk tohim.EHRLICHMAN:There's bad blood there, I'm told. MITCHELL:No.EHRLICHMAN:Isn't there?PRESIDENT:I don't know. I don't know. I don't knowthat there's anybody. Dick Berlin? Want to try him? He's been awfully close to Hooverthrough the years.MITCHELL:I didn't realize that. PRESIDENT:Oh hell yes. Close friends. Dick alwaysuseful and that he, he just oughta get outof there and John, in the meantime, I don't think John oughta handle the confrontation. What do you think?MITCHELL:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:You start it, you start it, and then maybe Ican step in and tell him that this (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:I got (unintelligible with noise)MITCHELL:One last point that (unintelligible) no(unintelligible)UNIDENTIFIED:Short, short, brief.MITCHELL:One last point. They're going to meet withPeterson and, uh...PRESIDENT:Yeah.MITCHELL:...Flanigan.PRESIDENT:Right.
