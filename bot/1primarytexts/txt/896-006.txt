TRANSCRIPT OF A RECORDING OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND JOHN EHRLICHMAN, ON APRIL 15, 1973, FROM10:35 TO 11:15 A.M.(Phone rings)EHRLICHMAN: (Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Poor guy. Who all have you seen thismorning?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I have Strachan up there right now.PRESIDENT:Yeah. I had a call from Kleindienst.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. I heard you did and I thought youought to take it. HePRESIDENT:Oh sure, sure, I didn't, I didn't refuse.He said "I shouldsee you, and I'd like to see you alone thisafternoon. Today.&#64258; I saide fine. He's coming tothe churchservice.EHRLICHMAN: Yeah. PRESIDENT:So I'm going to see him in the EOB. He saidhe had been up most of the night with Titus.Who is Titus?EHRLICHMAN:U.S. Attorney in the District. PRESIDENT:And, uh, whats,the other fellow's name?EHRLICHMAN: Silbert.PRESIDENT:No, not Silbert. EHRLICHMAN: Glanzer? PRESIDENT: Petersen.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, Petersen.PRESIDENT:See if he wants (unintelligible) Dicktogether. So I would see what he has tosay.APRIL 1511973p FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 2EHRLICHMAN: Okay.PRESIDENT:I assume it's the special prosecutor thing,among other things, among other things, butwhat else I don't know.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know either. Uh, heldobviously--get Titus in to find out what theprogress is in the Grand Jury; so he's now,he's now better posted than he has been, I'm sure, and he's probably a little bitter withTitus for not keeping him better posted, ifin fact he wasn't.PRESIDENT:With regard to this, this special prosecutorthing, what line do you want to take?EHRLICHMAN:Well, let's, let's think about it. Uh, hewants a special prosecutor so that...PRESIDENT:... he can stay on as Attorney General.EHRLICHMAN:... he can stay on and so that he doesn'thave any, so that he personally doesn't taint the process by reason of his closeness to Mitchell. And that, that makes sense.Sneed does not have that problem, and Sneedis controllable, within limits, and I think he's credible. I may be wrong about his credibility.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) this, I think he'scredible. The reason I think he's credible is something else, is that the Grand Jury, Iassume, is going to come through with someindictments. I mean, suppose they just indict Magruder and Mitchell until they're the least.EHRLICHMAN: Yeah.PRESIDENT:Well, Christ Almighty, that's the fish. EHRLICHMAN: Yeah.PRESIDENT:The big fish.APRIL 15, 1973, FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 3 EHRLICHMAN: Yeah. PRESIDENT:God damn it, what more do they want? ...EHRLICHMAN:The Spec...PRESIDENT:Now what's the problem with the specialprosecutort as I see it, it just putsanother loose cannon right there rollingaround the desk.EHRLICHMAN:Well, the special prosecutor...PRESIDENT:Reflects on-- EHRLICHMAN:will second-guess Silbert. Uh, I assumewill feel that his mandate is to--.PRESIDENT:Tear the hell of the the place?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Yeah. PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And, that's just a, that's just anadditional risk which you wouldn't have with the Dean who's been part of the, part of the process. Uh, I just, I don&#8482;t thinkPRESIDENT:I think we've had enough of the damn thingmyself, now I'll have to hardline it. Dick has not been, let's face it, he hasn't beenvery helpful throughout this thing.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. . PRESIDENT:And as to Mitchell-- EHRLICHMAN:He stood as far away from it as he couldget.PRESIDENT:And Mitchell, and Mitchell let it get awayfrom him. A little bitter, don't you think? is that what he said to you?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. He expressed real bitterness*PRESIDENT:Uh, you didn't get Colson yet? APRIL 15, 1973, FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 4EHRLICHMAN:Not yet. No. He's at church apparently.Ziegler will be here at church, then he's coming over. So, I'll see him while you're seeing Kleindienst.PRESIDENT:I told Colson this is about, uh, well, Iguess, uh, Hunt and Bittman, which, of course, could tie Colson in, right?EHRLICHMAN: Yeah.PRESIDENT:Up to his ass. There's not a God damn thingyou can do about that, is there John?EHRLICHMAN:No, really not, not at this point. You haveto depend on Hunt's natural secrecy andsecretiveness.PRESIDENT:John, there's nothing in it for Hunt. Letme ask you this, if you were to go back over everything he's done prior to that timeEHRLICHMAN: WellPRESIDENT:There might be something?EHRLICHMAN:Well, he's, he's, uh, up on, apparently, hehas perjured himself a second time. See, heperjured himself at the trial, then he wasgr4nted immunity, came back into the Grand Jury, and perjured himself again. The U.S. Attorney is looking down his throat andcould say to him, "Look, I can forget someof these counts if you're a good boy now."PRESIDENT:Yeah, but the point that I make is thii, isthe, is really, of course, you know, it'sthe limits of his testimony.EHRLICHMAN:Uh huh. Uh huh. PRESIDENT:If he testifies just on Watergate, that'sfine. He isn't going to get a damn thingmore than anybody else.APRIL 15, 1973, FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 5 EHRLICHMAN:I don't see any incentive for him to gobroader, and I haven't heard a whiff ofthat. (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) other, it was the last hewas involved in, will they give him immunityfor that? I suppose, or would they?EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. I don't think they can givehim immunity at this point.(Pause)PRESIDENT:How long did you talk with Strachan? EHRLICHMAN:Just, got started about ten minutes ago.And I've been doing all the talking so far.PRESIDENT:Is he trying, trying to talk with, uh... EHRLICHMAN:What Magruder had said about him and soforth. So, uhPRESIDENT:A-, Any chance for (unintelligible)?EHRLICHMAN:Not yet. Not yet.PRESIDENT:He's a good man, good man.EHRLICHMAN:I think he, I think he'll do fine. You seePRESIDENT:Do you expect anything better or worse(unintelligible) I was cogitating last night, and we've got the people that can, Imean on the obstruction of justice thing...EHRLICHMAN:That's right... PRESIDENT:... which I think is our main problem atthis time, well of course it is the mainproblem because it involves the other people.EHRLICHMAN: Yeah.PRESIDENT:Otherwise it's just Chapin.APRIL 15, 1973, FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 6 EHRLICHMAN:Yes, Chapin.PRESIDENT:And Mitchell, Magruder.EHRLICHMAN: Yeah. PRESIDENT:Possibly Dean, but if, uh-- EHRLICHMAN:Mardian and LaRue.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) on arraignment of the case?EHRLICHMAN: LaRue. PRESIDENT:They got him on that too? EHRLICIIMAN:Yeah. Yeah.PRESIDENT:You mean Magruder has?EHRLICHMAN: Yeah. PRESIDENT:That's going to be God damned hard to, thisfellow's lied twice too, lied once.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. That's -true. PRESIDENT:(Sighs) The people you've got withobstruction are Hunt and Goldblatt andBittman, right?EHRLICHMAN:Oh, Rothblatt the lawyer. PRESIDENT: Rothblatt?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, right. Well, I don't think Bittman isgoing to testify. I would be very surprised if he did.PRESIDENT: Why?APRIL 15, 1973, FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 7EHRLICHMAN: Well... PRESIDENT:Get him involved in obstruction of justice. EHRLICHMAN:Well, I just don't think, I think, I'm justguessing here, my guess is that he's workedhimself out a haven in all of this.PRESIDENT:Wouldn't serve his interests to get involvedin the obstruction of justice. He's a, he'sbasically almost a bag man, uh, not a bag man, but a message carrier, isn't he?EHRLICHMAN:No. No. He was a, Bittman was aninstigator of the, of the whole thing. Hewas concerned about his fee. And, uh--PRESIDENT:Oh, really, John?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Yeah. So he was one of the activepromoters' of that as near as I can tell.PRESIDENT:Spell out for me what, what you can best sayon the obstruction thing. What, uh, what,uh, was involved? I mean, the, uhp just fromour side, from our guys.EHRLICHMAN:Well, you had, you had defendants who wereconcerned about-their families and that'sunderstandable.. You had lawyers who wereconcerned about their fees, and that's less understandable.PRESIDENT:Oh yes. It's understandable.EHRLICHMAN:You have, you have, well, I mean in terms ofthe end result, you had a campaign organization that was concerned about thesuccess of its campaign...PRESIDENT: Yes.APRIL 15, 1973, FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 8EHRLICHMAN:and didn't want these fellows to sayanything in public that would disrupt the campaign.PRESIDENT:Is that, is that legitimate to want peoplenot to say it out in public which(unintelligible)?EHRLICHMAN:I think so. I think so.PRESIDENT: Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And then you had a-- PRESIDENT:No, but I mean, they'd say something inpublic that would disrupt the campaign orbecause it would embarrass people?EHRLICHMAN: Sure. PRESIDENT:Cover up, you mean?EHRLICHMAN:Sure. Sure. It would, uh, it would, uh,impeach the campaign in effect.PRESIDENT: Ah. EHRLICHMAN:All right, but at the same time, a lot ofthose same people who had that legitimatemotive... -Hello Manolo.SANCHEZ:Good morniniz, sir.-, (Door open and closes)(Noise)EHRLICHMAN:...they had the same people who had thatlegitimate motive had an illegitimate motive because they were involved in protectingtheir own culpability and here we're talkingabout LaRue, Magruder, Mitchell possibly.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) they wanted the defendantsto shut up in court?EHRLICHMAN:Certainly, certainly.PRESIDENT:So you, you, you would say, you could say,uh, -APRIL 15, 1973, FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 9EHRLICHMAN:You have here...PRESIDENT:In other words, you have Dean, we'll say,now let's take Dean...EHRLICHMAN:All right.PRESIDENT:... as a case in point. This sayssomething that Dean was not, we could get him out of it, he, he could weasel out ofthe, I say weasel out, he says he's notinvolved in the perjury.EHRLICHMAN:Well, see, Dean's problem is that he was intouch with these committee people who couldto Dean express a benign motive and at thesame time, had a corrupt motive. If I were Dean, I would develop a defense that I wasbeing manipulated by people who had acorrupt motive for ostensibly a benign motive. And, uh, in point of fact--PRESIDENT:Well, some did have a benign motive.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. That's right. You take afellow like Shumway over there for instance...PRESIDENT: Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:... uh, who has to think about the PR ofthe campaign.PRESIDENT:Making statements. Well, for example, it'sthe, it's like in the very tangential, andit's only tangentially that it touches you and Bob, uh, you know what I mean, that somebody came to you.EHRLICHMAN: Yeah.PRESIDENT:Good God, I mean you said go talk toKalmbach. If you were talking about keeping(6nintelligible) if you knew the defendantswere guilty, and if you didn't know who the hell else was.APRIL 15, 1973, FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 10EHRLICHMAN:That's correct.PRESIDENT:And you just thought that they were sure ofHunt.EHRLICHMAN:Well, you know, the thing that ran throughmy mind...PRESIDENT: Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:-was Howard Hunt has written 40 books... PRESIDENT: Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:... and Howard Hunt was worried about thesupport of his family. And I could see Howard Hunt writing an inside expose of howhe broke into the Democratic NationalHeadquarters at the request of the Committee to Re-elect the President.PRESIDENT: Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Now, if I had a choice between gettingcontributions for the support of Howard Hunt's family...PRESIDENT:Yeah. And that'sEHRLICHMAN: ...and that was pretty easy. PRESIDENT:And I suppose they would say though, that,uhEHRLICHMAN:Oh, I didn't care what Howard Hunt said tothe Prosecutor. He could've said anything he wanted to the Prosecutor in a secret, in a secret session. That didn't hurt us.PRESIDENT:It was all secret then.EHRLICHMAN:The Grand Jury was secret. PRESIDENT:The Grand Jury was ill operative at thattime.APRIL 15, 1973, FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M.EHRLICHMAN: Sure. PRESIDENT:It hadn't come to trial?EHRLICHMAN:Sure, it didn't come to trial until afterthe election.PRESIDENT:Yeah. That's what I see.EHRLICHMAN:So, uh.PRESIDENT:I think John wasn't, it was, the, nobody wastrying to keep him from telling the truth to the Grand Jury, to shut him up to the GrandJury.EHRLICHMAN:I can, I can say in truth and candor thatDean never explained to me that there wasany kind of a deal to get these guys to lie or to change their stories or to refuse to testify to the, to the, uh trial of theaction or anything of that kind. That wasjust never discussed. So, I don't feel too uncomfortable with this.PRESIDENT:Another thing, if Kleindienst resigns.EHRLICHMAN:If Kleindienst resigns, that says there'ssomething wrong with the Justice Department.PRESIDENT:So you'd keep-him?EHRLICHMAN:At this point.PRESIDENT:Even if he disqualifies himself? EHRLICHMAN:That's right, which wouldn't be anything toonew.PRESIDENT: Sure. EHRLICHMAN:Now he may have some-- PRESIDENT:Other information?APRIL 15, 1973t FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 12EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, or technical reason or something ofthat kind.PRESIDENT:Dean may have some information aside fromthe Grand Jury that I don't know if Deanwould want to have.EHRLICHMAN:I have a call in for him and the operator'sleft it over here. The reason that I do isthat he never did pin down for me what it is that he wants me to do. Now I've tendered to him as I think I had to.PRESIDENT:Good.EHRLICHMAN:And he said, "Well, I'll check it and, uh,be in touch with you tomorrow.&#64258; So fine, Ileft word over there that I am here. That'sthe only, the only reason for my call.PRESIDENT:Good. EHRLICHMAN:And you might ask him if there is anythingwe ought to do here in the light ofdevelopments, but I do feel that--thank you (coffee dishes clattering)--I do feel thatthere is nothing new in what I have beyondwhat Magruder has already told me, ...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:so, uh, I think it's largely academic.(Pause)PRESIDENT:On another matter, well, did Sloan(unintelligible) Magruder?EHRLICHMAN: Yeah.Titus would have told him last night whatMagruder said, and so, uh, he will, this morning, have, I think, as much knowledge about this thing as we have. There may beone or two, one or two details left.PRESIDENT:But Magruder said that they are hot afterColson--APRIL 15t 1973, FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 13EHRLICHMAN:On the suspicion-- PRESIDENT:Magruder's attorneys say that. Magruder hadnothing on Colson.EHRLICHMAN:No. The one phone call is the only incidentthat he has to relate.PRESIDENT:His attorney says I think they're hot ingoing after Colson.EHRLICHMAN: Yeah.PRESIDENT:The reason there, of course, is the, uh, isHunt.EHRLICHMAN:Right, the association.PRESIDENT: Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:And that's natural. You've got a guy in thecase thatPRESIDENT:Well Hunt is in deep with Colson.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Hunt has to know it. PRESIDENT:What do you do about Colson, John?EHRLICHMAN:I don't think there's much to do at thispoint. He's, uh, he's building his own defenses. I assume that he's doing whatever has to be done with Hunt, that only he coulddo.PRESIDENT:So, but,but--EHRLICHMAN:Well, you know, he's, he's, I'm sure, hashad surreptitious contact with Hunt.PRESIDENT:Yeah. He says (unintelligible) take care ofyour kids.EHRLICHMAN:And I think Chuck's natural proclivitieswill, will...APRIL 15, 1973, FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 14PRESIDENT:Do everything. EHRLICHMAN:do anything we can possibly do. You see-- PRESIDENT:With regard to defendants, uh, there isn't ahell of a lot more they can tell us that,that Magruder hasn't told (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:In other words, there isn't a hell of a lotthey can gain by, what was the, what could Liddy (unintelligible) to corroborate Magruder?EHRLICHMAN:That's all he could do. At this point,Magruder gives them everything they could have hoped to get from Liddy.PRESIDENT:And, let's see, how the hell do you getLiddy's sentence cut down under thosecircumstances.EHRLICHMAN:It may be too late for him.PRESIDENT:I wonder if it is. Huh? Or is it?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. He was only, uh-- PRESIDENT:Why the hell didn't he talk then, what doyou think?EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. I really don't. I don'tunderstand him at all and Magruder paints him as really weird, really weird.PRESIDENT:The thing with the gun...EHRLICHMAN:And all kinds of things. And, uh, there allkinds of Liddy stories running around.APRIL l5 1973, FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 15(Pause)PRESIDENT: Well, how did you feel when I called youdown here? I want to see what Kleindiensttold (unintelligible) and since he's asked, I will.EHRLICHMAN:I'll be here and if you want me foranything, why just holler.PRESIDENT:Well, look, I'll just listen to him. He hascome in so often. (18-second pause) I cansay on ITT, of course, we didn't my basicresponsibility (unintelligible) get that God damn McClaren to settle this case or something like that, and a--EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Yeah.PRESIDENT:But that's what he should do. EHRLICHMAN:No, that wasn't to settle the case.PRESIDENT:No, not settle.EHRLICHMAN:That was a, not to file an action. Youremember they were about to file a law suit andPRESIDENT:How did we know about it?EHRLICHMAN:Flanigan found out about it. PRESIDENT:You came and told me? EHRLICHMAN:I came and told you about it.PRESIDENT: Why,&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:You may have forgotten the details. PRESIDENT:why didn't we think they should file anaction?EHRLICHMAN:Well PRESIDENT:I am sure it was a good reason. APRIL 15, 1973o FROM 10:35 To 11:15 A.M. 16EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. We had a runa-, we had a runawayantitrust division at that point.PRESIDENT:Yeah, and I had been raising hell withMcClaren...EHRLICHMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:...on all this, and I said, now this is aviolation of the rulesEHRLICHMAN:On policy, not on--PRESIDENT:Basically that's the point, it's a violationof rules that I had laid down with McClaren.EHRLICHMAN:And, and, uh, I will, I will testify to mydying day that our approach to anti-trustcases has virtually without variation, onpolicy rather than the merits of an individual case.PRESIDENT:Wasn't that case (unintelligible)?EHRLICHMAN:There was one exception to that and that wasthat Granite City Steel case where we criticized an analysis the Council ofEconomic Advisers did.PRESIDENT: Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:And we, we went back on them on the specificcase rather than just the, the, uh, generalpolicy. That was on a, on a factual issue.PRESIDENT:What the hell was it, John, that(unintelligible) Kleindienst ticked. I don'tknow. Here's this guy, you know, who isreally good hearted and worked hard and all that sort of thing and went down to the, down to the wire and so forth. His advicehas been just wrong as hell on it.APRIL 15, 1973, FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 17 EHRLICHMAN:I think he felt, and I have not talked tohim about this, but I think he felt that ifhe involved himself in this case at all,uh, in Mitchell's behalf, that eventually it would have tainted the whole proceeding andmaybe redounded to Mitch6ll'sdisadvantage...PRESIDENT: Right.EHRLICHMANand...PRESIDENT:Oh, I suppose that's (unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:and that Mitchell's best chance-- PRESIDENT:Not Dean, but Mitchelll.s behalf that I'mjust thinking of, just so that we would be(unintelligible), God damn it, or try to know how to (unintelligible) and cover theson-of-a-bitch up.EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's true, that's true.PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN: He-- PRESIDENT:All you were ever asked was the generalquestion, "What's going on?"EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. He, well, this is kind ofinteresting. I may have told you about this, but the U.S. Attorney now feels thatDean overreached them by providinginformation out of the Grand Jury to the Committee for the Re-election. I think that may be legitimate criticism if he, in fact,did that. On the other hand, for him toprovide us with information inside, in the, for the orderly operation of the government,is another matter. That's two quitedifferent things. If, if you peddle information from a Grand Jury to the outside, or if you peddle it inside topeople who are responsible.APRIL 15,1973 FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M.PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:Oh, that was, uh, let me think.PRESIDENT(Unintelligible) Grand Jury at that point.EHRLICHMAN:He had information on,, uh, who was going tobe called as witnesses so that apparentlyMardian was able to get around and coachwitnesses.PRESIDENT:Did Mardian coach them? EHRLICHMAN:In some cases, Mardian, I guess, was veryheavy-handed about it, and uh...PRESIDENT:Well, is there anything wrong with that? EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, well there's something wrong with--PRESIDENT:He was not their attorney is the problem?EHRLICHMAN:Well, no, the problem, the problem is heasked them to say things that weren't true.PRESIDENT: Oh.EHRLICHMAN:When I say coach, I use the word loosely,and-PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Well, no, a fellow over there named Porter,Bart Porter, for one.PRESIDENT:Where is he now, in jail? EHRLICHMAN:No, he's in business somewhere, and, uh, he,he'll probably be indicted.PRESIDENT:They coached him to what, did he say? EHRLICHMAN:Say, uh...PRESIDENT:Was he, he was one of the buggers overthere?APRIL 15, 1973,FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 19EHRLICHMAN:No. No. Oh no, he worked for theCommittee.PRESIDENT:Worked for the Committee, well...EHRLICHMAN:But they asked him about higher-ups andabout whether there was any (unintelligible) and so on and so forth.PRESIDENT:How was he in the deal? How would he knowabout it?EHRLICHMAN:He worked over there in the, uh, inMagruder's office, and uh, he apparentlypassed money to, uh, Liddy, uh, from Sloan,and was privy to quite a lot of the information.PRESIDENT:I thought John wanted Liddy to take moneyfor that (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Apparently he did. Well, I don't meanafter, I mean to pay for equipment and toPRESIDENT:Oh. He was in on the whole deal.EHRLICHMAN:That's right.. PRESIDENT:Why the hell didn't the Grand Jury indicthim, then?EHRLICHMAN:Well, because they didn't have the, theydidn't have the evidence. There was,-there was a cover story which Mardian and otherscooked up, and, uh, Porter, corrorboratedthe cover story, is now indictable forperjury. He's a little fish who got caughtin the net.PRESIDENT:Poor son-of-a-bitch. It's wrong. It'swrong.EHRLICHMAN:The whole thing is just monumentally tragic.PRESIDENT:It is. We're not going to let it get usdown.EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's right, that's right, and it'llpass.APRIL 15, 1973, FROM 10:35 TO ll:15 A.M.20PRESIDENT:Dean is concerned, and it concerns me. EHRLICHMAN: Yeah.PRESIDENT:I don't think he could have been I thatactive in the pre, in the post yes, in the pre things, Magruder, Magruder and he played it a little wildly in some of that stuff.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I've got to get him in, and I hope youcan probably see him today.PRESIDENT:He would not help Dean. That's yourevaluation of Dean. According to Dean'sstory about those meetings, which he told meis about 180 degrees (unintelligible) Magruder's.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. That's right.PRESIDENT:He says, he says, "Look, we shouldn't betalking about such things,...EHRLICHMAN:I know.PRESIDENT:particularly not in the office of theAttorney General.&#64258; Magruder says he approved the million dollars and that'sabout right.EHRLICHMAN:And that Mitchell was the one whodisapproved it.PRESIDENT:Well, this could be a move I Magruder/Dean(unintelligible)?EHRLICHMAN:Could be 'cause Dean shows up veryprominently in the whole Magruder thing.PRESIDENT:And Dean was in Florida you said on someoccasion? Remember the Florida trip you told me about?APRIL l5j, 1973fFROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 21EHRLICHMAN:No. The three people there, Mitchell wasalready down there, Magruder and LaRue wentdown.PRESIDENT:For what purpose? EHRLICHMAN:Brought him the final Liddy proposal. PRESIDENT:The two fifty?EHRLICHMAN:With the Watergate and the Fontainbleau andthe McGovern headquarters spelled out.PRESIDENT:How did Dean find out? Dean find out thatthere was a three thing, three things on alist? He knew that, and went up and told Mitchell about that.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, and I--PRESIDENT:How did Dean know that?EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. I don't know how he knewthat. I assume that at some point in time, Magruder told him that.PRESIDENT:Oh, I see. Magruder talks pretty much,doesn't he?EHRLICHMAN:Uh huh.PRESIDENT:Likes to talk.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. And in a lot of these things, ofcourse, he had a lot of different versions of everything, but, uh, I think it'sreasonable to assume that he passed thatalong to Dean.PRESIDENT: Sure.EHRLICHMAN:Mitchell phoned me this morning to say thatDaniel Schorr had been on the shuttle when he rode back to New York.APRIL 15,1973, FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 22PRESIDENT:CBS caught him?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, and,, uh, well, no, they saw himhere,...PRESIDENT: Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:... and then they sent somebody out to theairport.PRESIDENT: Sure.'EHRLICHMAN:And so, he said to Schorr, he didn't knowanything about the Watergate, and he didn'tthink anybody cared about the Watergate andhe had just been down to the White House and he hadn't seen the President. That was all that he said. He is looking forward totestifying before the Ervin Committee, andso forth. So he called me this morning just to say that...PRESIDENT: Really?EHRLICHMAN:... he wanted us to know what he hadactually said in case there was any press report to the contrary.PRESIDENT:Well, Ziegler should simply say yes he washere to see you (unintelligible) it's true routine.EHRLICHMAN:Don't have any comment on that.PRESIDENT:No comment, that's such and so. What do youthink?EHRLICHMAN:I think that's the only way to handle it.PRESIDENT:I don't handle most of it. I have noinformation on the subject. I have no information on the subject. Seriously, I don't know, don't know,...EHRLICHMAN:That's right...PRESIDENT:I have no information on it. APRIL 15, 1973, FROM 10:35 TO 11:15 A.M. 23EHRLICHMAN: Right.PRESIDENT:Ziegler was great on that. EHRLICHMAN:I'm glad you complimented him last night.That'sPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) stay right at the(unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN: Good.PRESIDENT:He is a good man. They know it. They knowit. You've got to give them their stories.
