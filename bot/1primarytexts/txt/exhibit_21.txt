HALDEMAN:It's hard to believe, but it's uh, PRESIDENT:One thing that occurs to me, Bob, is thisand as I reflect a little on Magruder'sstuff.HALDEMAN:Um, huh. PRESIDENT:I'll be damned if I don't think that some ofthat could be, you know, uh, uh, exaggeratedbut I, I just don't knowHALDEMAN:I think that's right.PRESIDENT:&#8211;I, I don't know, I can't tell. He's uh,he's been so, uh, he's, he's uh, obviously flailing around like a wild man at the present time, but &#8211;APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.2HALDEMAN:No, no, he's not really. I think I, I thinkhe was earlier trying and er-, he was frantic but once, once he figured out wherehe was going I think, I think he'sPRESIDENT:He thinks that this is what he remembersnow.HALDEMAN:Yep. Um, huh.PRESIDENT:But he could not HALDEMAN:He does. PRESIDENT:&#8211;I'm not sure that his interpretations onvarious things are to be tr--, I mean to beinterpreted either way, you know, like his interpretation on Dean, his interpretationon, on Strachan, for example.HALDEMAN:Yep, yep. PRESIDENT:Certainly is&#8211; HALDEMAN:That's right end there &#8211;PRESIDENT:&#8211;I don't, I just don't know how it's gonnacome out, though, that's the whole point and I &#8211;HALDEMAN:I justPRESIDENT:&#8211;I just don't know as I, when I was seriouswhen I said to John, uh, at the end there I says God damn it, all these guys that p--,participated in raising the money and soforth have got to stick to their line that they did not raise this money to obstruct justice.APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.3HALDEMAN:Well, I sure didn't think they were.PRESIDENT:Hmm? HALDEMAN:I didn't think they were and I don't thinkthey did.PRESIDENT:Well&#8211; HALDEMAN:With maybe some exceptions.PRESIDENT:Right, right, of course, they will if they,I suppose there they will say that, uh, I mean, uh, uh, uh, I me--, like, like, Like Mc Cord has said it was the purpose, thatwas the purpose but that Dean-- thatsomebody told him that, and that so that didn't mean anything.HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:And the question, of course, is there, isLiddy and, and, um, the others, but&#8211;HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:&#8211;We shall see. You know it's the word ofthe, of the felons against the word of the men that raised the money, huh?HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:And, um &#8211;(Pause)HALDEMAN:Well, you just, 'cause you, you don't knowhow much will come &#8211; in out what way either,I mean thatAPRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.4PRESIDENT:Now we, we have, uh&#8211;HALDEMAN:We could get &#8211;(unintelligible)&#8211;PRESIDENT:At least, at least I think, I think (laughs)now we pretty much know what the worst is I, I do I don't know what the hell else theycould have that's any worse, you know what Imean, unless you know&#8211;HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Unless there's, and I mean, I don't knowthat uh, unless somebody's got, uh, somepiece of paper that somebody signed or some God damned thing but&#8211;HALDEMAN:Well&#8211;PRESIDENT:&#8211; that I doubt. HALDEMAN:Doesn't appear that there is such a thing.(pause)I mean, there's been no hint of that, what'sin here is, is all stuff that, that, uh, has been hinted at. It goes further than, than what was, uh, found in some areas but it's,obviously it's totally consistent basicallywith what everything John had developed.PRESIDENT:Let me ask you this. I wonder if if isn'tnot only fair but in our interest, uh, foreither you or John, now not going into too much detail, to fill him in on Magruder I mean, having in mind, uh, could Colson, uhcould, uh&#8211;HALDEMAN:I told Ehrlichman&#8211;APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.5PRESIDENT:&#8211;Colson. And, uh, I mean, we have nointerest, you know what I mean, in gettinghis ass up there, you know, uh, uh, guiltyon a perjury charge.HALDEMAN:Um, huh. 'Course there's nothing Jeb saidthat's inconsistent with anything that Chuckhas said.PRESIDENT:Oh. Could be right. Chuck could say yes, theLiddy project, sure, but I thought the Liddyproject was something else.HALDEMAN:That's right. That's what he does say. PRESIDENT:He does, huh?HALDEMAN:Yeah, and, and as, uh, Ehrlichman said and,and under questioning they specific, ah, uh, specifically said that he didn't get into the, uh, you know, any specifics on it andthey had nothing that hits him on anyspecifics. And, I think he's probably clear on them.PRESIDENT:I think he believes that, Bob, I mean, Iknow&#8211;HALDEMAN:I do, too. PRESIDENT:I think he believes that, but&#8211;HALDEMAN:I've felt that all along.Pause)PRESIDENT:Well, we'll sleep on the God damned thingand&#8211;APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.6HALDEMAN:Yeah.***********PRESIDENT:Uh, what's the situation tomorrow? IsEhrlichman gonna, uh, sit down with Ziegler again or something?HALDEMAN:YeahPRESIDENT:I, I do think that, PR thing and, and we'vegot to sort of, sort of make up our minds on what the hell Ehrlich&#8211;HALDEMAN:Get at that, I want to get at, get in astatement done.HALDEMAN:And we again, we got to get at, just sort ofmake this decision with regard to this Goddamned committee. I, I, I don't know.HALDEMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:And I'm, I, I still, I still have, uh, mixedemotions on it, I don't know, I don't know,I've (sigh) I've, I've been one way one time, one way another.HALDEMAN:Well, it's a, it's a mixed bag. It has, haspluses and minuses and I, it's hard to besure, which out- weigh the other.PRESIDENT:One way, scenario would be, simply say theywill all come up on, everybody will come upin Executive Session, including Dean, just say that, and make that offer and that's flat.APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.12HALDEMAN:Right. Will do.PRESIDENT:And, um, and it may be on the Dean thing.I'm almost inclined to think we ought togive on that. What do you think? (laugh) Theidea of backing down, we, uh, they're gonna think we've backed down anyway so what's thedifference.HALDEMAN:That has never bothered me and that, I, Iguess I'm wrong on it because it sure bothers other people.PRESIDENT:It bothers Ziegler and the rest, but&#8211;HALDEMAN:I think we gain more by backing down than welose.PRESIDENT:Yes, just say because of&#8211;HALDEMAN:I don't, I don't think you have any problemof being associated&#8211;PRESIDENT:&#8211;You, just that by all this&#8211;HALDEMAN:&#8211; been in enough battles anyway.PRESIDENT:&#8211;by all this, by all, because of all ofthese charges that have been around, these men are entitled to be heard in public.HALDEMAN:That's right.********** PRESIDENT:And I want them heard in public and I wantthem to tell their story in public. I'malmost convinced that that's what we ought to do with the whole damn bunch andAPRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.13PRESIDENT:not try to stand on the Dean thing and therest. Humph, get a settlement that way. Well, that's my present view, Bob, and wecan go on it. Uh, point, another point, uh,you, you will, you, you do, it's no one person you do tell, tell, and I uh, he canstill say you, that he just told him to tellthe truth, uh, you ought to tell Strachan but tell him&#8211;HALDEMAN:John's gonna te&#8211;PRESIDENT:&#8211;John is--but not in a way that Strachanindicates that he knows what the other fellow is saying.HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Strachan's smart enough to do that. HALDEMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:So that he's got to be prepared that he'sgonna be asked this and he's gonna be askedthat. John should just put him through a little wringer there.HALDEM~N:Yep.PRESIDENT:Well, John is the one that should do it.He's conducting an investigation for the President.HALDEMAN:Well, and he's got the information, I don't.PRESIDENT:Um, huh. HALDEMAN:But I can reconstruct.APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.14PRESIDENT:No, that's right, I agree, but John willknow the question to&#8211;HALDEMAN:Specific points is what he needs to cover.PRESIDENT:Um, huh. That's good. That's good. Well youknow the point (laugh) rather interesting to me tonight that, uh, you know when youreally think of what the hell, here we are,whole, it's really quite true enough without being melodramatic, the hopes for peace inthis damn world do depend on this officeright now in the next four years and, Goddamn it, we've got to, we've got to be sure that uh, that isn't compromised by anythingthat, you know, that indicates any lack ofconfidence in the President. Isn't that what it gets down to?HALDEMAN:YepPRESIDENT:That's why I think this is sort of a cheapprice to pay, you know what I mean, and, uh, on that point.HALDEMAN:That's exactly right.****************
