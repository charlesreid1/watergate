Well you know the point (laugh) rather interesting to me tonight that, uh, you know when youreally think of what the hell, here we are,whole, it's really quite true enough without being melodramatic, the hopes for peace inthis damn world do depend on this officeright now in the next four years and, Goddamn it, we've got to, we've got to be sure that uh, that isn't compromised by anythingthat, you know, that indicates any lack ofconfidence in the President. Isn't that what it gets down to?HALDEMAN:Yep PRESIDENT:That's why I think this is sort of a cheap price to pay, you know what I mean, and, uh, on that point.HALDEMAN:That's exactly right. ****************
