You can fix it so(unintelligible) we don't, so (unintelligible) we don't think (unintelligible). Said, well,the problem is that it tracks back to the Bayof Pigs. It tracks back to some other -- iftheir leads run out to people who had noinvolvement in this except by the contacts orconnections, but it gets to areas that are atthe (unintelligible) to be raised. The wholeproblem of this, this fellow Hunt, uh...So at that point Helms&#8482;s kind of got, thepicture, kind of like the picture.(unintelligible)...he, he said, he said, "We'll be very happyto be helpful to, ah, you know, and we'llhandle everything you want.I would like toknow the reason for being helpful.&#64258; And itmay have appeared when he wasn&#8482;t gonna get it explicitly but was gonna get it throughgenerality.So he said fine, and uh,Walters.

Somebody(unintelligible). But, the point John madewas the Bureau doesn't, the Bureau is goingon. That's because they don't know whatthey're uncovering. (Unintelligilble) say should continue to pursue it, uh, they don'tneed to because they've already got their caseas far as the, uh charges against these men,which may go up to the President or not anduh, as they pursue it because they'reuncovering some which has been -- should notbe hereafter.Sure enough, that's exactlv what--but wedidn't in any way say we had any political--...interest or concern or anything like that,uh, (unintelligible) One thingHelms did raiseis he said that, that Gray, he asked Graywhy he felt they're going into a CIA thing andGray said&#64258;, because of the characters involvedand the amount of money involved.&#64258; Saidthere&#8482;s a of dough in this someone and uh, (unintelligible) hereis the possibilitythat one of our guys--that probably has somesignificance to the question(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Well, we'll cross thatbridge.HALDEMAN:Well, I think they will 'cause our, see thereisn't any question.PPESIDENT:If it runs back to the bank -- so, what thehell, they, who knows, we always(unintelligible) contributed to the CIA(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:CIA gets money as we know 'cause, I mean theirmoney moves in a lot of different ways, too.PRESIDENT:Yeah. However we thought that it did a lot ofgood. (unintelligible)HALDEMAN: Right.

The CIA briefedhim on (unintelligible/REMOVED) the uh, thatthey're going to brief him on the covertoperation -- do anything else, but they said that's involves culpability.(unintelligible/REMOVED)HALDEMAN:The Democratic nominee, we're going to haveto brief him.PRESIDENT:Yes sir. (Unintelligible) I would, wouldn'tbrief him about a single thing we don't wanthim to have.HALDEMAN:oh, no. Just tell him what we want to tellhim.

HALDEMAN:Now, after you were nominated, Johnsoncalled you in, uh.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 2:20 TO 2:45 P.M.5PRESIDENT:Johnson was out of office.HALDEMAN:I mean, that's the point --he was(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Eisenhower didn't brief, Eisenhower did notbrief Kennedy.HALDEMAN:And it wouldn't, wouldn't be proper anyway..PRESIDENT:No I&#8482;m his opponent. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) because you're, you're hisopponent.PRESIDENT:We simply said that I will follow the samething that Eisenhower did.

Of course not, and,uh, I don't think we ought to let Kissinger brief him. I'd just have Helms, just Helms.HALDEMAN:Somebody will say "What do you think of it?"(20 Seconds Unintelligible with. tapenoise/REMOVED)JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 2:20 TO 2:45 P.M.6HALDEMAN:He can't, you see, he had no reason, nopossible reason to put Senator Hubert in.PRESIDENT:That's true.HALDEMAN:Uh, but they're just finding out that(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) the President(unintelligible) President.HALDEMAN:He (unintelligible) PRESIDENTWhat did you say that poll, Gallup(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:It's out. It's been mailed for two weeksnow down there.PRESIDENT:Wonder why he, why he, got it out soquickly. Usually lead time is two weeks.HALDEMAN:Well, actually, this is where lead time u--usually was until the last few months whenhe's spent a lot of money for some--. Uh,this time he's putting it out fast.PRESIDENT:Well, what, uh, what's his intention? HALDEMAN:Well, because he's got trial heats, and hewants to put this out probably before hesets, set the stage for the trial heats.PRESIDENT:Back before the Convention, the obviousthing (unintelligible) campaign for election(unintelligible/REMOVED). God damn(unintelligible) nobody even(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:Remember, we sat here and talked about thekind, of emphasis because we were, that wasa year and a half ago.

Took events didn't we?HALDEMAN:Yeah. They've always said we've know it'sthe case, but--JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 2:20 TO 2:45 P.M.7PRESIDENT:The great event (unintelligible) China, May 8,and Russia. That's all.HALDEMAN:If you don't have the events, you gotta, yougotta make everthing you can but obviouslyyou're better off to put three months or threeyears effort against one event than you are to put the same amount in, in a tenth of thateffort, against, uh, uh, non-event typethings. Then, maybe --PRESIDENT:I&#8482;m really impressed with Shultz and all thoseguys at the meeting.HALDEMAN:I told them, uh, I, I...PRESIDENT:Shultz (unintelligible) HALDEMAN:I talked to Shultz about calling Connally and,and, uhPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:I said that you had mentioned how impressedyou were with the paper he had done, and uh(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Eisenhower (unintelligible) show you howelections (unintelligible/REMOVED) and then inNovember, just before the election, he droppedto 57 (unintelligible) I remember(unintelligible) The reason for that wasnothing he did, it was Congressionally(unintelligible,).HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:That's why we're staying to you, McGoverncandidate (unintelligible) the problem we got to take on.HALDEMAN:(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(unintelligible) but in 1958(unintelligible) recession (unintelligible) hestarted the year, he started the year, that,uh, but, he, uh, with 60-30, that wasEisenhower. Most people forget. 58 March,52, which would give, uh 49-31.HALDEMAN:Eisenhower? PRESIDENT:Eisenhower.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 2:20 TO 2:45 P.M.8HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) was that the Fourth time.PRESIDENT:That was the third time.

That's when we were running.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:So there was Eisenhower in '60. We wererunning lower (unintelligible) July(unintelligible)HALDEMANIn other words, we are running lower.PRESIDENT:A little lower, yeah, but that's(unintelligible) campaign of '59. Kennedy,you really can&#8482;t tell about that. Uh, at theeve, of, of, his low in '62, in elections of'62, '62, was '62, yeah. But in '63, at theend, he was 57, 59, 57, (unintelligible)Johnson, then, of course, he was massivelyhigh in the upper 80's. We've never been very, high, but never as low as recently withJohnson.HALDEMAN:I think that's inevitable. I don't think youever will get up or (unintelligible) an 80.PRESIDENT:But, uh, not -- let me say -- of course --66-46, 50-56 (unintelligible)September 48,October 46, October 44, November 44, December48, December 46, that's all. (Unintelligible)Now of course we can 48, 49 by the nearest (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Yeah.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 2:20 TO 2:45 P.M.9PRESIDENT: Except his negatives were higher, 46, 42, 44,41, 44, 42. Our negatives have never beenthat high. We run around 49, 36 and uh(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:37 (unintelligible) Then it (unintelligible)goes on 46, 48, 45, 44, 39, 39, 38, 41, 46, 48, 48, 48, 39 (unintelligible)40, 41, 48 (unintelligible) then back up to 49, 406,44, 42 (unintelligible). The point that I'mtrying to make is that much does inevitably, ah...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Because you're under attack. HALDEMAN:Sure. PRESIDENT:You (unintelligible) you know that's whatyou hear (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:So then, what's before -the public eyethere's the focus of attention is on the things that are negative to theAdministration. Uh, uh, that's, it's aninteresting point. Buchanan, in response to the response to his, you know, attack memoPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...argues quite, strongly that the pointthat the attacks should always be turned to the positive side -- that-, he argues that,that's wrong, and that the attacks shouldstay on the negative side. Do not try to weave in also the positive, maintain thereare positive points. That we should, thatthere should be an attack program that is purely attack. That's one of" the interesting things have.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Except on foreign. I just don&#8482;t.want to --uh, I just think we ought to continue But,JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 2:20 TO 2:45 P.M.10HALDEMAN:(unintelligible) he&#8482;s talking about --PRESIDENT:Huh?HALDEMAN:He&#8482;s talking about primarilyPRESIDENT:Uh, huh. HALDEMAN:Except foreign -- you, you hammer yourstrong, point.PRESIDENT:I just think you've got to hit that over andover again 'cause God damn it, we gotta win our election.HALDEMAN: You don&#8482;t (unintelligible) against ourhammering our strong point on everything, when his argument is when you are attackingwhy should we do(unintelligible) we, weshould do some of our advertising &#338; should be an attack on McGovern advertising.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:&#8211;and that attack not have anything on Nixonstrong points.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:It should only make McGovern negativepoints.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:His argument being that it's impossibleinthis election for you to get less that40%...PRESIDENT:I know-- HALDEMAN:of the vote, and equally impossible for youto get more than 60.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMANIs that set up over there? ZIEGLER:It's ready to go.HALDEMAN:If you could go over early if we could getthis for sure on the networks. Have to wait til 3:00 -- we got a Problem because of (unintelligible) film processing. Becausethey're shooting.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 2:20 TO 2:45 P.M.11HALDEMAN:You know, they shoot with one camera thenthey serve all three networks out of thepool so that we keep rolling out.Therefore, we are better off (unintelligible)UNIDENTIFIED:Get ready.PRESIDENT:Clear over there at the other side of the(Unintelligible). You get the word to them.ZIEGLER:Yes sir.But I don't want to take your todo it.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) my time. I&#8482;ll qo across, Ijust wanted to, uh (unintelligible)ZIEGLER:Yes sir. Absolute (unintelligible) PRESIDENT:And uh, based from the thing this morning,do you feel it&#8482;s, uh, worthwhile to(unintelligible) till MondayZIEGLER:Yes, sir. HALDEMAN:Well, let's do it earlier in the day,because we are complete jeopardizing(unintelligible) Ehrlichman.SEVERAL VOICES:(unintelligible)ZIEGLER:At 2:00(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I&#8482;ll do it. I&#8482;ll be (unintelligible). Haveyou, want set it up? You want me to come right this minute?ZIEGLER:Well, I don&#8482;t-- anytime you feel comfortable(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(unintelligible) Okay. Let (unintelligible)step on it.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 2:20 TO 2:45 P.M.12ZIEGLER:As soon as possible.HALDEMAN:His argument is if you, to start with, yougot 40% of the people who will vote for youno matter what happens&#8211;PRESIDENT:I agree.HALDEMAN:&#8211;and you got 40% of the people who will voteagainst you no matter what happens, so you got 20% of the people left in the middle who may vote for you or may not and that 20 iswhat you gotta work on. His argument isthat you're so well known, your pluses ore clear, clear as well as your minuses; thatgetting one of those 20, who is an undecidedtype, to vote for you on the basis of your positive points is much less likely than getting them to vote against McGovern byscaring them to death about McGovern; andthat, that's the area that we ought to be playing.PPESIDENT:Well.HALDEMAN:I, I have to admit that these people are inthe business, you know --PRESIDENT:That's right, by God, I am not going to doit. I really want you to bring in Flaniganand all these others about that and lay it to &#8218;em. I'm not going to do it.HALDEMAN:Yeah .PRESIDENT:Don't you think he'll agree?HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Oh, you don't?HALDEMAN:No, I think they will. They'll agree forawhile, you make -- you got to agree with them. The conclusion, and they'll say well why not do it anyway.PRESIDENT:No, no, no, no, no, nothing, never.HALDEMAN:I'd say that.JUNE 23, 1972 FROM 2:20 TO 2:45 P.M.13PRESIDENT:You can't take them for granted. Listen, hecould think I'm setting him up.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) Muskie.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) a reasonable man. God damnit (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Our best (unintelligible). The Buchanantheory is, the Buchanan theory is, have em be against Muske.PRESIDENT:We don't give a shit for poor Nixon. Beagainst Muskie. Screw em otherwise. Allriqht, fine, Bob (unintelligible with noise). I don't know whether our peoplehave scared the people enough about Muskieor (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:We feel that they are, PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:They are, but I think you got to build thatup. His point is that so little is known about McGovern, you'll have a better chance of changing people's minds about him thanyou do about (unintelligible)(Voices fade) (End of Reel)
