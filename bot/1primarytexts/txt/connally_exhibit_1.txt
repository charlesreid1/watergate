PRESIDENT:I suggest that we sit over here everybody.More room and, uh -- [coughing] Sit down.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah, this --UNIDENTIFIED:But -- UNIDENTIFIED:Oh, that's all right.UNIDENTIFIED:I had that Senator [unintelligible]UNIDENTIFIED:Came in and got me nervous, uh, he -- UNIDENTIFIED:If he'll go with you, well, that's great. UNIDENTIFIED:Very clever.UNIDENTIFIED:Phil, uh, [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:They're counting on Hubert. UNIDENTIFIED:Concentrate on Hubert. PRESIDENT:Hubert is supposed to have told Meany thatI, uh --SHULTZ:I don't know that you've met Don Rice, fromthe Office of Management and Budget.PRESIDENT:Yes.SHULTZ:Don Rice. [Several[Unintelligible]voices]RICE:How are you?SHULTZ:I talked with Meany this afternoon about theSST.PRESIDENT:What'd he say?SHULTZ:He said he was all out on it. If there wasanything we wanted him to do, he wanted to do it. He'd be ready to do it. They --PRESIDENT:Well, could you ask him to, could you askhim, could you phone him back after thismeeting and ask him to call Hubert Humphrey, with the understanding he, uh --SHULTZ:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Hubert Humphrey has told everybody that hewas going to be for it. And he understood - - only because Meany was for it.SHULTZ:That's right.PRESIDENT:Because Labor was for it. And, now that weunderstand he's wavering in it, he 's breaking. And that Hubert Humphrey's votemay make the difference.SHULTZ:All right. I'll call him. He said he -- hehad been calling me and that he had quite afew disappointments, he said. But, anyway,I think we're working on it and we will continue to work on it.PRESIDENT:And he, however, is apparently not doingmuch.SHULTZ:That's right. PRESIDENT:Uh, uh, uh, well, we ought to review this,this situation with regard to milk. Now,uh, John, would you express your views, uh,to us all -- you expressed them to me this morning. [Coughs] I had a [unintelligible]you fellows heard their story today.EHRLICHMAN:It's dead. It's -- CONNALLY:Well, Mr. President, I don't -- I understandyou did meet with 'em -- But I don't want totry to go back over the economics of it, uh,I'm not --PRESIDENT:How about the politics? Can you --CONNALLY:Uh, I'm not trying to talk about it ordiscuss at any great length the, the economics of it, but as far as the politics are concerned -- looking to 1972, it, uh, itappears very clear to me that you're goingto have to move, uh, strong in the Midwest. You're going to have to be strong in ruralAmerica, uh, and particularly that part ofthe country. Now, there are a lot of thingsthat you can't do, uh, with respect tofarmers. They're almost, uh, beyond help atthis point. Uh, they feel like they are. They don't feel like anybody's trying to help them. Uh, every time they turn around,they hear somebody talking about, wanting toincrease imports on beef from Australia to, to -- in behalf of the consumer. Hog pricesare down what, uh, fif--seventeen dollarsHARDIN:[Unintelligible] dollars from twenty-nine. CONNALLY:They were, they were twenty-nine a year ago. HARDIN:It's because they grew so many.CONNALLY:Well, we had, there's, there's lots ofproblems and they're responsible for a lot of them. Fortunately, beef prices have heldup fairly well but, uh, grain is aninsoluble problem so far as I can tell. Uh, it, it, it -- worrying with it for years, so I, I just don't know many areas that you cando many things -- that's the net of what I'msaying -- to help, uh, the farmers uh, and the dairy people now. These dairymen are organized; they're adamant; they'remilitant. This particular group, AMPI,which is the American Milk Producers Institute or something, uh, represents aboutforty thousand people. The one thatparallels them on the East, uh, Mid-Con, or something --HARDIN:Mid-American.CONNALLY:Mid-American group represents about fortythousand. The Southeastern group, uh, Dairymen Incorporated, whatever their nameis, represents a lesser number, but probablyin the range of twenty thousand members. They, uh, very frankly, they tap these fellows I believe it's one-third of onepercent of their total" sales or ninety-ninedollars a year whichever is --PRESIDENT:Like a union.CONNALLY:Oh, it's a check-off. No question about it.And they're meeting, and they're having meetings. They have them a Sabreliner airplane, and they just travel from one partof the country to another part of thecountry to get these fellows in and theysign them up and it's a pure check-off deal. And they, they're amassing an enormous amount of money that they're going to putinto political activities, very frankly.And, uh, uh, I think, in the first place -- I think they've got, uh, a legitimate cause.I wouldn't, I wouldn't recommend that youdo, you ta--, anything that didn't have any merit to it. They're asking for, for an increase in the cost, uh, in the price of ahundredweight up to four -- $4.92. Theyoriginally started out a $5.05. And, uh, uh, I am sure that these fellows can-allargue more convincingly than I can that onthe basis of the merits, they ought not to get it, or that milk production will go up or something else, but the truth of thematter is, the price of milk is now peggedat $4.92. You're not going to raise the price of milk. Uh, they're supporting the price of milk themselves with their ownmoney by buying cheese. Right today. Now,if they, if you don't support the price, if Cliff doesn't support it at $4.92, they'regoing to have to drop it because their,their resources are not such that, that they can continue to pay the difference between, what, $4.66 and the, and the $4.92. Sothey'll drop the price.HARDIN:Now they're, they're in trouble. They'vealready spent more money than they have, andthey're going to drop the price of milkabout fifty cents a hundred., on, uh, April one. [Unintelligible) lost to the Treasury. This is why they're desperate --UNIDENTIFIED:They're not, they aren't simply involvedwith low resources.CONNALLY:They, they may well have. Now, there's sometalk that, uh, that if the management ofit's in trouble and so forth -- I don't believe it, I don't believe it.UNIDENTIFIED:I'll, I'llCONNALLY:They just raised and paid twenty thousanddollars for a meeting in Brownsville not toolong ago. And this means -they've gotsecurity. And, uh, they're doing some things that I think are a little strong- armed tactics, perhaps, in, uh, theorganizing, uh. But, uh, I don't criticizethat unless we are prepared to take on business and labor and all at the same time.There's no point in denying the farmerwhat's the practice for labor. And, uh, so I'm not, I wouldn't judge it on a moral basis. I judge it on the basis of, uhHARDIN:You've heard all the rest of itCONNALLY:I'm addressing myself to the narrow aspects,to the political aspects of it. I don'tthink there's a better organization in theUnited States. If you can get it, uh, you can get more help from, that, uh, will be, uh, be more loyal to you. And, uh, and Ithink they've got a worthy case to beginwith. And uh, that being true, I just think you ought to stretch the point. I wouldn't wait till next year, so that -- I know thatthere's been some advice given to you, towait till next year. Uh, that's -- I will differ with that, simply because they'regoing to make their association and -theiralliances this year and they're going to spend a lot of money this year in various Congressional and Senatorial races all overthis United States. And, you don't want tobe in a position -- as you well know better than I -- you got no questions when peoplethink they forced you into doing somethingfor them. And they're not now in that position. If, if you do something for them this year, they think you've done it becausethey got a good case and because you'retheir friend. If you wait till next year, I don't care what you do for them. They'regoing to say, "Well, we put enough pressureon them this election year, they had to do it." And you, you get no credit for it. So it's still going to cost you an enormousamount of money next year, and you get nopolitical advantage out of it. And, I justthink that, uh, that unless you just, uh --the economics of it are just beyond reach,or beyond question that, uh, if you ought to really seriously think about doing it this year.PRESIDENT:That's the problem. I have two problems --is that you have it in the House and the Senate.CONNALLY:What you are going -to do on that?UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible] PRESIDENT:What I mean is, that if you don't do it,they're going to do it anyway.CONNALLY:I think if you don't do itPRESIDENT:If they do, CONNALLY:they're going to pass it.PRESIDENT:I think they do.HARDIN:I think it's PRESIDENT:We have a damn near insoluble problem. HARDIN:I think it's, as it stands today, it'salmost certain to pass.CONNALLY:Uh, I think -that's right. EHRLICHMAN:Is that what Belcher told you? HARDIN:Yes, yes, I think they got a hundred andfifty names on the bill.UNIDENTIFIED:You sure? HARDIN:And, uh,UNIDENTIFIED:What is it?HARDIN:and, uh, the Speaker's all out for it. CONNALLY:Absolutely. Wilbur's all out for it. UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.CONNALLY:Well, they're going to pass it through theHouse. Beyond any question in the world.HARDIN:And, uh, and, uh, they'll pull the liberalson this one, uh, because they're, they'llsay they're going to embarrass the President,PRESIDENT:That's right.HARDIN:Uh, the liberals might attract the consumersin any other situation. But they won't doit now.PRESIDENT:That'll raise the price, you see. I mean,that's the way they'll cut the liberals off.They'll say: No, they're going to -- weguarantee, we won't -- like they told us this morning, we won't raise the price;we'll cut back on production -- we'll have avoluntary --HARDIN:Uh, I spoke, I spoke a little bit with them,this morning, uh, but 1 just don't quite know --UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]CONNALLY:Now they've already figured out and how --They're circulating -- I've had it for daysthey're circulating how they're going to cutyou up this year. And that's what they're going to do. They got it all figured out. They're passing this out on the Hill, justexactly how many electoral votes they'regoing to cost you if you veto the 85% bill - - which they think they're going to pass. And I think they're going to pass it. Andthey say that it'll cost you Missouri,Wisconsin, South Dakota for sure. Veto will probably cost you Ohio, Kentucky and Iowa.And, then they go on down and they take thestates and they figure what percentage of the states it's going to cost you and they're going to [unintelligible]HARDIN:Well, if it does pass, I don't think thePresident has any choice but to sign it.PRESIDENT:Well-, all right.CONNALLY:Well, then, what do you do? If you do,you've cost yourself the money -- you've lost your political advantage. You, you're, you're infinitely worse off.PRESIDENT:Probably.CONNALLY:That's where you are. HARDIN:I think so.PRESIDENT:What's the cost?HARDIN:Oh, it's just a wild guess. They saidthirty-five million and I would suggest thatit's, uh, nearer a hundred.PRESIDENT:You would? HARDIN:Now if they could get, if they need to wehad a little talk after you left andUNIDENTIFIED:Right.HARDIN:uh, about whether they really couldinfluence production. And they could, ifthey went all out to do it. And what theywould do, a year from now, would be end up with a hundred and twenty million -- billion pounds of milk produced. Uh, they'd be amature enough organization that they could,uh, recognize that they had made a mistake and could go out and tell their members theyhad to survive. Uh, well, they're -- maybewe won't talk about that. Uh, it's a fact of life. UhPRESIDENT:Uh, it seems to me that the problem we have,Cliff, is this. That, uh, and as you knowwe have decided on a different course of action in the cheese business and all the other --HARDIN:Well that has to be done. That has, has tobe done anyhow.PRESIDENT:Oh, what I mean isn't that what we decidedthat, and that was all we could do.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah. SHULTZ:The higher you raise the price, the morecertain it is that you have to be strictabout the imports, otherwise, all we'redoing is paying the money to the foreigners.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.SHULTZ:You have to make a judgment on the importbusiness.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Uh, I see yourSHULTZ:See that high price here throughout thePRESIDENT:Uh, uh [Several[Unintelligible]voices]UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah. Uh.UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible] PRESIDENT:like high interest rates. UNIDENTIFIED:That's right.UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]. Yeah.PRESIDENT:Well, it's one of those things where withall you experts sitting around where youhave to make a political judgment. Mypolitical judgment is that the Congress is going to pass it. I could not veto it. Not because they're milk producers, but becausethey're farmers. And it would be justturning down the whole damn middle America. Uh, where, uh, we, uh, where we, uh, needsupport. And under the circumstances, Ithink the best thing to do is to just, uh, relax and enjoy it.UNIDENTIFIED:The legal --CONNALLY:Mr. President, trade for both years, if youdo it. Trade for this year and next year, if you possibly can.PRESIDENT:With these people?CONNALLY:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:Well, CONNALLY:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:can that be done? I, uh, that's what I, uhCONNALLY:Yes, sir. PRESIDENT:That would be great. CONNALLY:Yes, sir.EHRLICHMAN:If you could make a deal for the two yearsCONNALLY:Yes, sir. It can be done. HARDIN:They will do that.UNIDENTIFIED:You bet.CONNALLY:Won't they Phil? CAMPBELL:Yes. UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah, I wouldUNIDENTIFIED:Well, I would say the price is stable.PRESIDENT:Yes, that's correct.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah. HARDIN:The other thing Mr. President, so they'renot askingUNIDENTIFIED:And, uhHARDIN:that, uh, on grounds that it would be justhard to answer. These fellows have atendency to say, "Well, now look, uh, lookat the construction industry. Look at Labor. Uh, and then why be so chintzy with us? Uh, all, all evidence is our costs keeprising, and that we're under the freeze,and, uh, you take it out on us not, not the people who are really causing the problem."And, this is hard to answer, uh, when it's achallenge put that way --CAMPBELL:Well I think we can settle for a UNIDENTIFIED:We've got this other consid-PRESIDENT: All right, make the best deal you can.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Do it for two years and, uh, we, uh, we, uh,we know that, uh, and as I say, I appreciatethe, the very fine judgment to the contrarywhich, which you can't do as, uhHARDIN:Now, we must do one other thing, uhUNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Let's let them know what we're doing. That,uhEHRLICHMAN:Let's get credit.UNIDENTIFIED:Oh, God, if we're going to do thisCONNALLY:Mr. President PRESIDENT:Let'sCONNALLY:Please, may I interject a suggestion?PRESIDENT:Uh, uh UNIDENTIFIED:[Sighs] CONNALLY:UhPRESIDENT:Anything you like.CONNALLY:Well, let's don't, let's don't trade the,uh, uh, through Agriculture, uh, on the meritsPRESIDENT:Yeah.CONNALLY:until, uh, some other conversations are had.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah. CONNALLY:UhHARDIN:[Unintelligible] we've got a little work todo. We've got to let Page, that, uhUNIDENTIFIED:What? HARDIN:I mean Bob Dole.CONNALLY:All I'm saying is youEHRLICHMAN:No. Later, because they're CONNALLY:you're in this thing for everything, you,you can get out of it. [Unintelligible]UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible] UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Now you could hold your position now tillyou get the green light, couldn't you?CONNALLY:Oh, sure. PRESIDENT:What? EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, as I say, then Agriculture doesn'tneed to do anything right away.UNIDENTIFIED:He 'PRESIDENT:You, you're now thinking of the political offer?EHRLICHMAN:In a day or so.[Severalvoices]:[Unintelligible]SHULTZ:The sooner you do it, the better off you'regoing to be, aren't you?HARDTN:Uh, yeah. Possibly, uh -- Page, SHULTZ:In a day or so.HARDIN:now, Page knows Dole. I wish he hadn't doneit quite this way, but one of his little talks to the Speaker, and Wilbur -- He gotthem to agree to hold the bill until hecould talk to the White House.PRESIDENT:Well -- CONNALLY:He, he could make, Mr. President, I suggestto you that somebody could make a littlecapital with the Speaker and with Wilbur.Now if you'll do this. Now somebody can do it. Now, they'll, they'll say, well, you,you know, they'll say, well, "You did itbecausePRESIDENT:Yeah. CONNALLY:we've introduced a bill."PRESIDENT:All right.CONNALLY:But I know somebody down here can make alittle time with them. How much, how much Idon't know. But it's worth trying,obviously, because they're both extremely interested in it.EHRLICHMAN:Phil, move over there, would you. We'd liketo get the picture of some of the Housegroups that are interested in the topic [intelligible]. All together now.HARDIN:Wilbur, uh --UNIDENTIFIED:Shouldn't happen [unintelligible]SHULTZ:As an aside on this: Wilbur passed themessage to me via Bill Gifford to thank youvery much. Apparently his family was --UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah, he got around to the White House. SHULTZ:And, uh, he spoke with -- and the grand --and he said the grandchildren loved it.Wilbur says it's the nicest thing that'shappened to him in years.PRESIDENT:Hah.SHULTZ:And I just wanted you to know[unintelligible] he apprecia--, he really had a very pleasant evening.CONNALLY:Let me tell you how important I think it isto Wilbur. Now I don't -- I can't vouch forthis. I haven't pursued it. I haven't followed it up. I don't want to. But, Iwas told that you could almost name yourprice with-Wilbur short of all-out supportof revenue sharing if you did it.EHRLICHMAN:You know him? CONNALLY:Yes, sir. CAMPBELL:You that close to him?CONNALLY:That's correct.CAMPBELL:And he knows this bill intimately. CONNALLY:That's correct.CAMPBELL:And he can explain it to you better than thedairymen.CONNALLY:That's correct. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah.CONNALLY:He sure can.PRESIDENT:I noticed they had a strong man fromArkansas in there, didn't they?EHRLICHMAN:Well, uh, let me ask this. Uh, who's theguy that told? Uh---PRESIDENT:What my point is: This is something where Iwould not have it done by you, Cliff, inAgriculture. Let's have it done in a way bysomebody who has to get something out of it. Uh, like George. You see my point?HARDIN:Uh hm. Sure.PRESIDENT:On Wilbur.HARDIN:Sure. PRESIDENT:How would that be? Does that sound allright to you, John? Or should you tell him?CONNALLY:No. I think somebody other than me, sir. PRESIDENT:Yeah. CONNALLY:I think George, orPRESIDENT:Yeah.CONNALLY:whoever -- PRESIDENT:You see my point?SHULTZ:Yeah, maybe John and I.PRESIDENT:Maybe John Ehrlichman and George. CONNALLY:And don't overlook the Speaker, Mr.President.PRESIDENT:And do the same with the Speaker. But, Imean the point is, when you do something for these fellows, remember, don't just let them think that we're doing it for, uh, turningour back on policy. Get a picture to them.UNIDENTIFIED:True. Right. UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:You have that point, now.UNIDENTIFIED:Yes, sir. PRESIDENT:Fine. CONNALLY:I could maybe suggest a better way. If youtie it in uh, keep in mind that Wilburcalled me twice about this.PRESIDENT:Uh huh.CONNALLY:And I think Jerry called him about this.HARDIN:Did he call you about it? CONNALLY:The Speaker called me, which is veryunusual, and he just normally doesn't dothat.UNIDENTIFIED:Well, that's fine Dick, both talked to youabout it.PRESIDENT:All right. Fine. Well, all right.EHRLICHMAN:There is --PRESIDENT:I think that, I think that, I think what ourploy should be here is basically, uh, uh, Ithink maybe it's, uh, George and John --What do you think? John Ehrlichman.EHRLICHMAN:I think that would be great. PRESIDENT:They, they're going to have to deal withthem on revenue sharing and all these otherprograms. And, and you, uh, pass the word to -- you of course handle all the -- Pageand all that.UNIDENTIFIED:Heh, heh. UNIDENTIFIED:If you give them cookies they, they'll loveit.HARDIN:Now look there, there are a few of those,fellows -- Let's take them home with us.[Severalvoices]Oh, yeah.HARDIN:There are only a few. And, uh, I think wegot to give them a chance to holler back.EHRLICHMAN:I'll agree.UNIDENTIFIED:Now -- I'll agree. PRESIDENT:That's right. That's right.HARDIN:We may need them again.PRESIDENT:Yes, sir. They've been wonderful. UNIDENTIFIED:Wonderful. HARDIN:We're going to let you time the announcementand see what we can [unintelligible)UNIDENTIFIED:We may need some hands. UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:What would you like to do with the timing,Cliff? I mean -- What are you suggesting?HARDIN:Well, I think it depends on George. Uh, youknow, uh, uh, we've got to accommodate -- Ithink we ought to go this week.PRESIDENT:Good, I think the sooner the better, HARDIN:And, uh --- PRESIDENT:because, uh, let's don't have, let's don'tdo it under pressure.HARDIN:And, uh, uh, uh, I think that if you can getWilbur and, uh, uh, the Speaker quickly,UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.HARDIN:uh, then, uh, uh, you get a hold of Page andthese other fellows, uh, also, but, as soon as they know what we are thinking about, uh,it will leak out pretty fast.SHULTZ:Well, I don't think that there's anyproblems about the thing and, uh ---PRESIDENT:But be sure you get to Page Belcher.UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible] PRESIDENT:He could get Wilbur. UNIDENTIFIED:But you're going to have to [unintelligible]UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]SHULTZ:If you wanted to, you could do it. At thesame time, of course, you get different people doing it so they don't get crossedup.UNIDENTIFIED:All right. CAMPBELL:It, it, it -- it's going to have to almostbe done simultaneously because just as soonas they've talked, it's so important, everybody is going to know it. The first one that knows -is going to get on the phoneand call the dairymen,UNIDENTIFIED:You, uh --- CAMPBELL:and soon as one of the dairymen knows, allof them will.PRESIDENT:I'll say. SHULTZ:Uh, but aren't you and somebody going towant to talk to the dairymen about it so youcan set up aEHRLICHMAN:Make a two year deal. UNIDENTIFIED:A two year deal. SHULTZ:two year deal.PRESIDENT:I think first you have got to -- Well, thenand they ' re going to know - They're, they're --CAMPBELL:But no, Mr. President, you could ask, youcould ask if we're able to do anything would you be satisfied to leave this alone next year. They'll come back promptly and you'llget a way out if you do. They'll never,never listen to the Secretary. We've found that --UNIDENTIFIED:Um huh.CAMPBELL:But I can tell you -- UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible] UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]CONNALLY:May I suggest?UNIDENTIFIED:And I know --CAMPBELL:I suggest just as quick I can get them onthe telephone.PRESIDENT:All right. CONNALLY:May I also suggest -- PRESIDENT:Make sure you got the deal to present to me.And, uh ---UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible] CAMPBELL:No. I'm not notifying them anyway.PRESIDENT:No, no, no, no, no. [Unintelligible]EHRLICHMAN:His idea is that he'll say, "Look we wereable to do this. Will you pledge this." See?PRESIDENT:Uh huh.CAMPBELL:No, no problem. EHRLICHMAN:Still hypotheticalPRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah. Then that way the decision isstill open. And then, boom.CONNALLY:And you can pretty well seal this, John andGeorge, uh, when you talk to Wilbur and theSpeaker. The two year aspect.UNIDENTIFIED:You handle it. CONNALLY:You should hear that out and we'll talkabout it.WHITAKER:I just want to raise one point. The thingthat got that started is the concern of over-production. If you don't think downthe line with me it will be more trouble inthe end.CAMPBELL:This -- if, if we do it'll be two years offand not next year.UNIDENTIFIED:That's it.PRESIDENT:And John, what other problems does thatinvolve? Uh, uh [unintelligible][Severalvoices][Unintelligible]HARDIN:[Unintelligible] you may have over-production next year. And we may blame iton this. But it will be for other reasons.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Actually it takes more -takes longer thanthat.PRESIDENT:There's one thing about this, it's one thingabout this industry that is, uh, quiteinteresting. It's that, uh, it's, uh, it'sa big business. From the standpoint -- you know, they go into this business, you know,and people say -- It -- As a matter of fact,I get the impression, Cliff, and I'm not too much of an expert on the farmer, but I get the impression that -- For example, withregard, uh, uh, regarding, regarding theprice of hogs. People who go into that business, from what I gather -- it's prettyeasy, isn't it?HARDIN:Changing the par--when compared PRESIDENT:The dairy business, on the other hand,requires an enormous net invest--,investment. You know, you can raise morepigs, right?HARDIN:Yes. And the, and the times get -- PRESIDENT:Fast. Fast. And that's why the pig, po--,the corn-hog ratio uh -- that business goesup and down almost like an escalator, doesn't it?UNIDENTIFIED:Right.CONNALLY:Mr. President, two litters per year and theaverage now is running better than seven pigs per litter, isn't it?CAMPBELL:Mr. President, there has been some studiesrun on this and the cost is approximately, it approaches two thousand dollars per cow.So you just multiply fifty cows, a hundredcows, a hundred-fifty cows by two, two thousand dollars. You've got a pretty good investment.PRESIDENT:Well, you have an enormous-- so somebody isgoing to go into that business.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.PRESIDENT:I mean, uh, there are added things; it's,it's a big, uh --CAMPBELL:Big chunk of cash. Can't go less than fiftycows,PRESIDENT:I know. Yeah. CAMPBELL:seventy or eighty. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah.HARDIN:But, uh, we had, what, a million dairyfarmers, uh, ten years ago and down four hundred thousand from what you were.SHULTZ:We have a, uh, we have a problem to, to, uh,think about here on the antitrust side of this thing, uh, they're going to wind up in trouble.HARDIN:Yes, they may have --SHULTZ:If they try to control production, HARDIN:Yeah, they, theySHULTZ:they're over -- they're, very eager.UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible] HARDIN:may have already done it. But, uh, ut -- CONNALLY:The significant thing is they have legalcounsel and they're following their advice.HARDIN:Well -- PRESIDENT:Good. SHULTZ:They do have a good legal counsel.EHRLICHMAN:They have a good one.PRESIDENT:They've got them all over the country. CONNALLY:Uh, there are many folks (unintelligible]but I don't know Cliff what you're talkingabout.HARDIN:Uh, well, they're, they're sure, they'resure awfully close to the line. They arenot the first group in the economy, that'sdone that.UNIDENTIFIED:Oh, I'll say. [Laughing]PRESIDENT:Well, we won't prosecute the farmers.HARDIN:Could I bring up just one other thing? PRESIDENT:Sure. HARDIN:It's a somewhat related subject, Mr.President.PRESIDENT:Sure.HARDIN:It doesn't have anything to do with thismatter; but, uh, --PRESIDENT:Britain?HARDIN:No.PRESIDENT:No. HARDIN:Uh? Meat, meat imports. Uh --PRESIDENT:Oh, that. I thought we decided that.HARDIN-We did. PRESIDENT:We are going to import aren't we? HARDIN:Uh, a little, uh, as little as possible.But Mr. Houthaker called me yester--He'sconvening a meeting now, and, uh, he thinks we ought to force the price of beef down.And let in more imports. And he's, he wantsa inter-departmental meeting. I think it's next Tue--Monday or Tuesday. And this is just going to, uh, raise havoc with thecattlemen all over again. When we just gotthem all quieted down. They've all written articles; they're just bleeding about what the President did.PRESIDENT:What would I do, if, if -- and didn't -- Iimported not too much, and meanwhile hold that middle, middle options?HARDIN:Yes. And, uh, they're, and uh, so I calledEd and I said, "Now, I want to see you bleed in your publications. I want you to post all the -- and support the President. "Hewent all out with me on this. "Well," hesaid, "we [unintelligible] just a little." And I said, "If I see one word[unintelligible] not one damned one of youis ever going to get in my office again. Do I make myself clear?" And they did say it in their publications. They did go all out.PRESIDENT:Um huh.HARDIN:Uh, so, uh, uh, to open this up again now,it just would be terrible. There's no -- Infact it'll change a bit. It's just a --George, can you, can you collar that guy?And, uhSHULTZ:No, I, I--- HARDIN--He's, he's the one that's given the NixonAdministration the reputation for being forlow farm prices.
