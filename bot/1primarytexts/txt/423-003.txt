This and that.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:And, and, also for, you, you don't wantanybody guilty, or, it isn't the question.We know that everybody in this thing did it whatever they did with the best of intention. That's the sad thing about it.EHRLICHMAN: Sure.PRESIDENT:I told them all this morning, I don't wantpeople on the staff to divide up and say,"Well, it's this guy that did it, or thisguy that did it," or th-th-th-thEHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:The point is what's done is done. Do thevery best we can, and cut our losses and soforth, best you could ever do.EHRLICHMAN:Did he talk to you about this, uh, thisthing, uh, uh...

I don't think,though, I don't think that I, even thoughit's moving along, that story and so forth. I don't believe, that I should go out onnational television like tonight or tomorrowand go out on the Watergate Commission and then come on the next day on national television on Vietnam. I don't like thefeeling of that. I, uh, I, I don't thinkyou get it ready by that time? My view would be to, get the Vietnam out of the way, andmaybe get this right if you could. I thinkthat gives you time.EHRLICHMAN:The, the, the picture of the Congress havingan inquiry going on...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...and the Grand Jury having an inquirygoing on in the Judicial branch...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...it seems to me give s you, ah, ah,opening, thinking about it after a while...PRESIDENT:Step in.EHRLICHMAN:...and say well, step in and say theredoesn't seem to be anybody except me in the position to resolve this. I have talked with the, ah, ah, Chief Justice of theUnited States and I have talked with SenatorErvin and Senator Baker-and, uh, I, uh, uh, after that consultation, uh, have proposedthis, uh, three branch, uh,...PRESIDENT:Well. EHRLICHMAN:...board of inquiry. PRESIDENT:To start with the proposition of Ervin andBaker, where you don't come across rightthere at the beginning on whether you can get the three men. I'm not sure you can getthe three branch, John.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.3EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'm not sure you could get it either.It, it, ah--PRESIDENT:But, but, just suppose you couldn't. Thenstill think that it is good, possibly a good idea I mean, ah, but we`ve got to havesomebody other than me that could broker it.The problem you've got, to recognize, you see, is that Haldeman. can`t you can't, Dean can`t Mainly because, you possibly could,but it`s, it's also that I don't want to putout the whole White House. You're the only One who could do it.EHRLICHMAN:The, ah--PRESIDENT:I have to do, this is why I told you,(unintelligible), but I might have to useRogers on the Job to be the broker.EHRLICHMAN:Fine.PRESIDENT:Uh, he`d be good, uh (unintelligible). Idon`t know whether you could get a&#352;(Knocking on door)PRESIDENT:Come in. Oh, hi. How are you?ZIEGLER:Thought we'd just check, in. PRESIDENT:Sure, sure. Right.ZIEGLER:The reason&#8211;PRESIDENTIn position, righ&#352; ZIEGLER:...we have, uh, the, uh, patientrehabilitation veto today and the uh, uh, wehope it's a return shipment to Thieu inSouth Vietnam, preparations, uh, that, uh--PRESIDENT:Right.ZIEGLER:Describing.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.4PRESIDENT:Right.ZIEGLER:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Right.ZIEGLER:Then tomorrow we should, uh, send statisticsand so forth. Uh, I talked to, uh, Dean andto Moore this morning in terms of whether ornot we say anything (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Right, right. ZIEGLER:The Grand Jury's stuff, and, uh, Dean'sfeeling is that we should not today.PRESIDENT:That is my feeling. ZIEGLER:And, uh, Moore's feeling is that we shouldnot today, and I concur in that(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yeah. My view is today, unless you've gotsomething more to say&#8211;ZIEGLER:That's right.PRESIDENT:...I would simply say I have nothing to addto what they said yesterday.ZIEGLER:That's right.PRESIDENT:I, I think that would be better(unintelligible).ZIEGLER:The, uh--PRESIDENT:Just get Out there and act like your usualcocky, confident self.ZIEGLER:Then the, uh, if, if I am asked a questionabout whether or not, uh, Dean would appearbefore the Grand Jury, if I'm asked thatquestion&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. It's, uh&#352;ZIEGLER:...how should I handle that?(Unintelligible). I could -- two options: One would be to say that,uh (unintelligible); the other would be,(unintelligble)MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.5PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I'm just saying, uh, whatif this charge is wrong (unintelligible) thecharge. Well, if you say (unintelligible)permission (unintelligible). What do you think, John?EHRLICHMN:You tell him.PRESIDENT:Well it's easier to get out of, becauseit's, that.'s not a matter (unintelligible), this, this point (unintelligible).ZIEGLER:I`m inclined to think, (unintelligible), I'minclined to think that today my best position is just to say that, that this wasdiscussed yesterday, uh, I've said al1 along(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yeah. ZIEGLER:We are willing to cooperate (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Don't you think that we`ve indicatedcooperation.UNIDENTIFIED:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:And when we see the form of the, the form ofthe request, or whatever it is--ZIEGLER:These matters must proceed, this matter mustproceed in an orderly and judicious mannerand, uh, I'm not going to get up here, uh,on the podium-- and listen to that.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:The other, the other thing you might do issay you know a fellow like John Dean is in avery tough spot when somebody levels an accusation against him, uh, he's really inthe poorest position to defend himself ofanybody in the government.(Privileged material deleted)MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.6EHRLICHMAN:Uh, uh, I don't know whether it would, uh, whether it would add anything, really, fromour standpoint to say this but the point ishere, that the poor guy is under disability to step out and defend himself because ofhis position. Because he is Counsel to thePresident, and that in a, in a way&#8211;PRESIDENT:I know. EHRLICHMAN:...inhibits him, from, steppinq(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I wonder if it is very difficult for John orfor Ron to get into that?EHRLICHMAN:Well, but it is in the setting of, would heappear before a Grand Jury? Uh--PRESIDENT:That`s the thing Why don't we, why don't wejust say,"Well, that's, that's the matter,that, that, that, this is a matter that isnot before us.&#64258; We should point out that, uh, that, uh, uh, that, uh, he, he, he, is Counsel to the President, uh Counsel, uh, tothe, to the White House, uh, counsel to theuh, he's the White House Counsel, uh, to uh, uh, uh, and, and, therefore, uh, the, his,his appearance before any political group,therefore, uh, is, is on a different basis from, anybody else, which is basically what I, you know, when I flatly said Dean wouldnot appear but that others would. You know,I, I, I did say that, of course he--EHRLICHMAN:It was on a, it was on a different basis.At the same time...PRESIDENT:the same time he&#8211; EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;a man, uh, in, in any position ought to begiven a chance to, uh, defend himself&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.7EHRLICHMAN:against groundless charges.PRESIDENT:That's it. Mr., Mr. Dean certainly wantsthe opportunity to defend himself againstthese charges. He would welcome the opportunity, welcome, would welcome theopportunity and what we have to do is towork out a procedure which will allow him to do so consistent with his unique position of being not just a member of the President'sstaff, but also the Counsel. That is a:lawyer, Counsel, uh, not, not lawyer, but, the responsibility of the Counsel forconfidential.ZIEGLER:Could you apply that -- to the Grand Jury? PRESIDENT:Yeah, Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:The Grand Jury is one of those occasionswhere a man in his situation can defendhimself.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Clearing himself.PRESIDENT:Yeah, yes. The Grand Jury, uh, that, well,actually, if called, look we`re not going to refuse to, for anybody called before theGrand Jury to go, are we, John?EHRLICHMAN:can't imagine it. PRESIDENT:No, well, he was called, uh, he was called,he will be, he will be cooperative,consistent with his, uh, responsibilities asCounsel. How do we say that?EHRLICHMAN:That lie will be cooperative.PRESIDENT:He'll fully cooperate.EHRLICHMAN:You better check that with Dean. I knowhe's got certain misgivings on this.ZIEGLER:He did this morning.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well, then, don't say that.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.8EHRLICHMAN:Well, uh, uh, uh, I think you could pose thedilemma without&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...saying flatly what you re going to do. PRESIDENT:Yeah. We, uh, but maybe you just don't wantto (unintelligible). You better not, youbetter not try to break into it, John.ZIEGLER:You get into posing the dilemma. PRESIDENT:Then you're gonna, you're gonna break intoquestions. I'd simply, I'd stonewall themtoday.ZIEGLER:I think so.PRESIDENT:That is not before us at this time, uh, butlet me emphasize, he will coop--as the President has indicated, there will be complete cooperation consistent with theresponsibilities that everybody has on, uh,the separation of powers. Fair enough? And, of course, and consistent with, uh, Mr. Dean's responsibilities is uh, uh, uh, is,is, is, other responsibilities as a Counsel.See? How about just saying it that way? Well, John, do you have doubts, uh?EHRLICHMAN:No. Why don't we--PRESIDENT:f Ziegler opens--Ziegler has to answersomething.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, no. The only, uh, uh thing thatoccurred to me is, when I read this stuffyesterday, was that somehow or another, uh, we, we should be introducing the fact that,that, uh, Dean's going to get a chance toclear his name.PRESIDENT:Yeah.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.9EHRLICHMAN:Uh, but, but, eventually that's gonna, thatIs gonna, there's gonna be, uh, anopportunity for that in some forum, at sometime, in some way. But maybe you get into the business of saying, uh, you don't--PRESIDENT:I don't 'think this is the day to do it.This is the day (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Yeah.ZIEGLER:I think soPRESIDENT:Yhea. ZIEGLER:Give more than a--PRESIDENT:Say.ZIEGLER:(Unintelligib1e) how we approach the who1ematter instead of moving (unintelligible). The President's expressed confidence(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:You can also say that the President istalking, uh, (unintelligible) staff today regarding the Dean situation, Ithink we should say that--EHRLICHMAN:There was a meeting here this morning&#8211; PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;involving Deputy...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...Attorney General... PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...Under Secretary of Interior...PRESIDENT:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:...Ivers...MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M.

Let it go.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) because if we-- PRESIDENT:Fine, well, when, when we are ready to dosomething, I'll hold your meeting. Let itgo.EHRLICHMAN:Okay, let me know.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M.

Finance Minister.

Gray cores in andsays,&#64258;I`m sorry we can`t put you, you can`t,"he says, "I can`t get confirmed and I, I don't want to be confirmed in way that I, that, in which there is any division. Theremust be unanimous support for whoever is,and support for and trust in the Director of the FBI. As a result of the hearings todate, it is obvious that I am not going getthat kind of support, in the Senate, even though I believe that I may be confirmed. Under the circumstances, I respectfullyrequest you withdraw my name.&#64258;.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.12and send somebody else down. That's a verysound basis. I'm thinking of doing that. Iwould hope next week right after Thieu.EHRLICHMAN:Ah, well, what do you think about doing thatsimultaneous with the appointment of aCommissioner. We could...PRESIDEENT:Oh yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;it could be written up in the sameannouncement. Say, "here's a fine manwho's been unfortunately splattered by thisthing. It is a case study in, uh, how...UNIDENTIFIED:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, and how bystanders can get splashed,with this sort of thing."PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:It's now to the point where he can't even(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:You think, also, John, or at least youthought somewhat of the idea, that we should get Kleindienst out, too, at this point?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah.PRESIDENT:How do we do that? EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'm going to see him today, and Bob'sgoing to talk to him, and we will hit himfrom two directions on this. And uh, that's and uh--PMESIDENT:Get Kleindienst to resign?EHRLICHMAN:Oh, no, no, no, no, no, oh...PRESIDENT:Get him out front. (Unintelligible) get him, out of the office.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.13EHRLICHMAN:Oh, oh, no. I hadn't, uh, we hadn't talkedabout, that.HALDERMAN:That`s Bill. Rogers.PRESIDENT:Well, I'm sorry, John. EHRLICHMAN:No. I, uh, uh, we talked this morning about getting him out front. I'm afraidit`s--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) of' canning him right away.Uh, let's see. Let's see about that. Maybewe can. Well, whatever, what have you gotto report. John and I have just started a (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:All I have is Dean's report. I did not talkto Mitchell, because this thing changed (unintelligible) want to be from Mitchell. Uh, he had a long conversation again todaywith Paul O'Brien, who's the guy he's been -- talked with yesterday. . .you know, this, that, and all that, and uh, he says O'Brien is very distressed with Mitchell. The morehe thinks about it, the more O'Brien comesdown to Mitchell could cut this whole thing off, if he would just step forward and cutit off. That the fact of the matter is asfar as Gray could determine that Mitchell did sign off on it. And if that's what it is&#8211;PRESIDENT:You mean as far as O'Brien is concerned.HALDEMAN:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:You said, "Gray."PRESIDENT:What's that?HALDEMAN:I'm sorry. O'Brien not Gray. As far asO'Brien can determine, Mitchell did sign off on this thing and, uh, that's, and Deanbelieves that to be the case also. Hecan't, Dean doesn't think he can prove it, and apparently O'Brien can't either, butthey both think that that...PRESIDENT:That's my intention.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.14HALDEMAN:The more O'Brien thinks about it, the moreit bothers him with all he knows, to see allthe people getting whacked around, that hesees getting whacked around, in order tokeep the thing from focusing on JohnMitchell, when inevitably it`s going to endup doing that anyway and all these other people are going to be so badly hurt they're not going to be able to get out from under.Uh, and that's one view. How, to go back onthe Magruder situation as O`Brien reports it, having spent several hours withMagruder, yesterday afternoon, O`Brien andParkinson. Jeb believes, or professes to believe, and O`Brien is inclined to think he really does believe, that the whole Liddyplan, the whole super-security operation,super-intelligence operation was put together by the White House, by Haldeman, Dean and others.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:Really, Dean, that Dean cooked the wholething up at Haldeman`s instruction. Uh, thewhole idea of the ned for a super-intelligence operation. Now there`s some semblance of, of, uh, validity to the point, that I did talk, not with Dean, but withMitchell, about the need for intelligenceactivity and--PRESIDENT:And that Dean recommended Liddy?HALDEMAN:Yeah, but not for intelligence. Deanrecommended Liddy as the General Counsel.PRESIDENT:Yeah, but you see this is where Magrudermight come--Well, go ahead. Okay.HALDEMAN:Uh, that Mitchell bought the idea that wascooked up in the White House for a super- intelligence operation, and that this wasall set and an accomplished fact in Decemberof `71 before Liddy was hired by the Committee. But then, Liddy was hired by theMARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.15Committee to carry it out and that's whyDean sent Liddy over to the Committee. Thenthere was a hiatus. There were thesemeetings in Mitchell`s office, uh, where Liddy unveiled his plan. And the first planhe unveiled, uh, nobody bought. They alllaughed at it. Cause it was so bizarre So he went back to the drawing, board and came back with a second plan and the secondplan didn`t get, bought either. That was at the second meeting and everything just kind of lingered around then. It was sortof hanging fire. Liddy was pushing to getmoving on his plans. And at that point, he went to Colson and said, &#64257;Nobody will approve any of this, uh, uh, and, you know,we could, we should be getting,&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...getting going on it." And Colson thengot into the act in pushing to get which,which started with the Colson phone call toMagruder saying, &#64258;Well at least listen to these guys.&#64258; Then the final step was--all ofthis was rattlnig around in January. Thefinal step was when Gordon Strachan called Magruder and said Haldeman told him to get this going, &#64257;The President wants it done andthere`s to be no more arguing about it.&#64258;This meaning the intelligence activity, the Liddy program. Magruder told Mitchell this,that Strachan had ordered him to get itgoing on Haldeman`s orders on the President's orders and Mitchell signed off on it. He said, &#64257;Okay, if they say to doit, go ahead.&#64258;PRESIDENT:Uh, was that this is the bugging? HALDEMAN:The whole thing including the bugging.PRESIDENT:Shit.HALDEMAN:The bugging was implicit in the second plan.I, Dean doesn`t seem to be sure whether it was implicit or explicit.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.16PRESIDENT:Well, anyway--HALDEMAN:He doesn't think that particular bug wasexplicit, but that the process of buggingwas implicit and, as I didn't realize it, nor did he, but it was also in the Sandwedgegoing way back--the early plan. That,incidentally, is, a potential source of fascinating problems in that it involved Mike Acree, who`s now the CustomsCommissioner or something, Joe Woods, uh, afew other people.PRESIDENT:Nothing happened?HALDEMAN:It, wasn't done, that's right, but there--at some point, according to Magruder, after this was then signed, off and put way, Mitch--Magruder--Mitchell, Mitchell, calledLiddy into the office and read him the riotact on the poor quality of stuff they were getting. (Pause) Uh, that's basically the scenario or the summary of, of what Magrudertold the lawyer. Dean`s theory is that bothMitchell and Magruder realize that they now have their ass in a sling, and that they'retrying to untangle it, not necessarilyworking together again, at least he doesn't think they are. But, in the process of that they are mixing apples and oranges for theirown protection. And that they`reremembering various things in connection others, uh, (unintelligible) like Hunt andLiddy (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:You don't have another (unintelligible) doyou?HALDEMAN:No, sir.(Privileged material has been deleted)HALDEMANHe says, for example, Magruder doesn'trealize how little Dean told Liddy. Hethinks that Dean sent Liddy in. Liddysaid...Frankly, now as far as Dean screening to Liddy was that, uh, you as General Counsel over thereMARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.17HALDEMAN:can also take as a side activity the, the(Cont'd)political intelligence question because wedo need some input on demonstrators andstuff like that. That, that, that they're not doing anything about, but henever got, into any setting up an elaborateintelligence aparatus.RRESIDENT:Okay HALDEMAN:Dean, Dean says that as a matter of fact, incontrast to Magruder`s opinion, at the firstmeeting where a Liddy plan was presented, everybody at the meeting laughed at the planon the basis that it was just, it was sobisarre that it was absurd and it would be funny.PRESIDENTYeahHALDEMANThe second meeting, Dean came into themeeting late. He was not there during most of the presentation, but when he mace in he could see that they were still on the samekind of a thing. And he says in effect, I got Mitchell off the hook because I said, I took the initiative in saying, "Youknow it`s an impossible, uh, proposal and wecan`t, we shouldn`t even be discussing, this in the Attorney General`s office, &#64257;and all that. Mitchell agreed, and then that's whenDean came over and told me that he had just,had seen this wrap-up on it, and that they, still it (unintelligible) was impossible,and then we, that they shouldn`t be doingit; that we shouldn`t be involved in it and we ought to, uh, drop the whole thing. Then as Dean said, &#64257;I say a problem there and,uh, I thought they had turned it off and inany event I wanted to stay ten miles away from it, and did.&#64258; He said the problem fromthen on, starting somewhere in early JanuaryProbably, was that Liddy was never really given any guidance after that. Uh, Mitchell was in the midst of the I T and T and allthat stuff, and didn't focus on it...MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.18PRESIDENT:Martha.HALDEMAN:&#8211;and Magruder was running around with otherthings and didn't pay much attention, andLiddy was kind of bouncing around loose there, uh.EHRLICHMAN:Well, now, how do you square that with theallocation of money to it?HALDEMAN:We11, that, presumably was the subject infocus by somebody else...EHRLICHMAN:Magruder.HALDEMAN:...Who signed off on that. EHRLICHMAN:Magruder, uh, possibly Mitchell, possiblyStans, certainly, uh-- (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I suppose they could, say the allocation ofmoney was just for intelligence operations generally. I think (unintelligible).That's what my guess is. That's whatMagruder said is true.EHRLICHMAN:Some was paid to focus on, somebody&#352; HALDEMAN:Yeah, someone, someone focused and agreedthat there had to be some intelligence andthat Liddy should get it.EHRLICHMAN:And against the background of the two plansbeing presented and rejected, the naturalquestion that would arise is, well, what are you going to do with the money? You don t have an approved plan?HALDEMAN:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:So that doesn't put anything together. PRESIDENT:Well, it doesn`t hang together, but it couldin the sense that the campaign--HALDEMAN:Well, what he, what he thinks, he thinks...MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.19PRESIDENT:My guess&#352;HALDEMAN:...that Mitchell did sign off on it.PRESIDENT:That's the point. But uh, my, my guess isMitchell could just say, "Look," I, he says, he has this and that and the other thing,"and. I said, &#64257;all right go ahead, but therewas no buying of this da, da, da--"HALDEMAN:He says if, you heard Dean's opinion(unintelligible)PRESIDENTSo--HALDEMAN:Now O`Brien says that Magruder`s objectiveor motive at that moment is a meeting withMitchell and me. And, uh, that what hehas told some of the lawyers, maywell be a shot across the bow to jar that meeting loose. Uh, O`Brien doesn`t really believeJeb, but he`s not sure. O`Brien is shook alittle bit himself as he hears all this. But he does see very definitely and holds also to the theory of mixing of apples andoranges. He`s convinced that Jeb is pushingtogether things that don`t necessarily fit together in order to help with a conclusion. And, again, he`s verydisappointed in Mitchell. He feels that Mitchell is the guy that`s letting people down. O`Brien made the suggestion that ifyou wanted to force some of this to a head,one thing you might consider is that O`Brien and Parkinson, who are getting a littleshaky now themselves, are retained by theCommittee. That is by Frank Dale, who is the, the Chairman of the Committee.PRESIDENT:Does it still exist?HALDEMAN:Uh, the&#8211;They, did they're--PRESIDENT:They aren`t involved in the damn thing arethey? O`Brien and Parkinson?MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.20HALDERMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:They ran this all from the beginning?HALDERMAN:Oh, no.PRESIDENT:Well, that is what I thought. HALDERMAN:But they are involved in the post-discovery,post-June 17th.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)O`Brien says, &#64257;Everything with theCommittee,&#64258; said, &#64258;What you might want toconsider is the possibility is to waive ourretainer, waive our, our, uh, privileges and instruct us to report to the President allof the facts as they are known to us as towhat really went on at the Committee to Re- Elect the PresidentPRESIDENT:I`ve been, I, I`ve been informed. For me tosit down and talk to them and go through,uh--HALDEMAN:I don`t know, he, he says, he doesn`t meannecessarily personally talk to you, but hemeans to talk to Dean or whoever youdesignate as your, your, uh, man to be working on this. Uh, now&#352;other facts. Huntis at the Grand Jury today.(Unintelligible) We don't know how far he is going to go. The danger area for him is on the money, that he was given money. Uh,he's reported by O'Brien, who has beentalking to his lawyer, Bittman, not to be as desperate today as he was yesterday, but tostill be on the brink, or at least shaky.What's made him shaky is that he's seen McCord bouncing out there and probably walking out scot free.PRESIDENT:Scot free, - a hero.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.21HALDEMAN:And he doesn`t like that. He figures it,it`s my turn. And that he may go--PRESIDENT:That`s the way I, that`s the way I wouldthink all of them would feel.HALDEMAN:And that he may decide to go with as much asis necessary to get himself into that sameposition, but probably would only go with as much as is necessary. There isn`t a feeling on his part of a desire to get people, but,us, you know, a desire to take care ofhimself. And, uh, that he might be willing to do what he had to do to take care ofhimself, but he would probably do it on agradual basis and he may in fact be doing it right now at the Grand Jury. He feels, in summary, that on, uh, both Hunt and Magruderquestions we`re not really at the crunchthat we were last night. He isn`t as concerned as he was when we talked to him last night. (Unintelligible) we are nowgoing with uh, uh, Silbert--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:The U.S. Attorney has, is going to Siricaseeking immunity for Liddy so Liddy can be awitness. Liddy`s lawyer will argue against immunity for he does not want it. Uh, Dean`s judgment is that he`ll prob- he`llprobably fail. Sirica will grant it givenSirica`s clear disposition--PRESIDENT:Then he gets , if he doesn`t talk, then hegets contempt. Is that it?HALDEMAN:If Liddy is in, if he gets immunity, hisintention, as of now at least, is to refuse to talk, and then he in contempt. Thecontempt is civil contempt and it only runsfor the duration of the Grand Jury which is of a limited duration. And as long ah he`sin jail anyway, it doesn`t make a hell of alot of difference to him.PRESIDENTI, I would almost bet that's what Liddy willdo.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.22HALDEMAN:Well, that's what Dean will al-also bet.Deanhas asked through O'Brien to see Maroulis, orwhatever his name is, Liddy's lawyer, forLiddy to provide a private statement sayingthat Dean knew nothing in advance on theWatergate, which Liddy knows to be the case. To his knowledge, Dean knew nothing about itand Dean would like to have that statement inhis pocket and has asked Liddy, Liddy's lawyerto ask Liddy, for such a statement, which hefeels Liddy will, would want to give him. Uh,raised the question whether Dean actually hadno knowledge of what was going on in the intelligence area between the time of themeetings in Mitchell's office, when he saiddon't do anything, and the time of theWatergate discovery. And I put that directquestion to Dean, and he said, "Absolutelynothing."PRESIDENT:I, I would, I would, uh, the reason I wouldtotally agree, that, that I would believe Deanthere (unintelligible) say would be lying to us about thatEHRLICHMAN:Well he said --PRESIDENT:But I would believe for another reason--thathe thought it was a stupid God damned idea.EHRLICHMAN:There just isn't a scintilla&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...of hint that Dean knew about this. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Dean was pretty good all through that periodof time in sharing things, and he was trackingwith a number of us on --PRESIDENT:Well, you know the thing that, the reason Itold Bob--and this incidentially also coversColson--and I, uh, and I, I don't knowwhether, ah--I know that most everybody exceptBob, and perhaps you, think Colson knew all. about it. But I was talking to Colson,remember exclusively about it--and maybe thatMARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.23was the point--exclusively about the issues.You know, how are we going to do this andthat and the other thing. Everything from,uh, mainly, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, (unintelligible) how do we get the laborthing, how do we get this, how do we get, uhthe Catholic school (unintelligible).HALDEMANYeah, the Cath--the aid to Catholic schoolon the new, you know, the uh, Ehrlichman's,uh, I mean, Colson's fight with theparochial.PRESIDENT:Right. That's what it is, that's whatstarted it. But in all those talks he hadplenty of opportunity. He was always saying, "Hey, we gotta do this," but Colson in that entire period, John, I think hewould have said, that there was, say, "lookwe've gotten some information,&#64258; but he never said a word. Haldeman, in this whole period, Haldeman, I am sure&#352;Bob and you, he talkedto both of you about the campaign. Never aword. I mean now maybe that all of you knew and didn't tell me, but I can't believe thatColson--well (unintelligible).HALDEMANMaybe Colson is capable of--if he knewanything out of that, of not telling you what we were at least--PRESIDENT:Well, at least, at least&#8211;HALDEMAN:We were&#352; PRESIDENT:...nothing, of that sort because as a matterof fact, I didn't even know--I didn't knowfrankly that the, uh, the Ellsberg thing and so forth, er, electronically thing, you know what I mean?HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:You (unintelligible) report (unintelligible)on that.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.24PRESIDENT:And I guess there you deliberately didn`ttell me&#352;EHRLICHMAN:Well, sir, I didn't know, uh, uh. I didn'tknow what&#8211;UNIDENTIFIED:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;Dean and his crowd were up to untilafterwards.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:And I told you, afterwards we stopped itstopped it from happening again.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:In that setting, but, uh--PRESIDENT:That was in the national security&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:That was in the national security-- PRESIDENT:Leak thing. EHRLICHMAN:That's right, but the, the, uh, interestingthing about Colson, corroborates what yousay, is that when I got a phone call from Secret Service saying, there had been this burglary&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah,EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;the first guy I called was Colson. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Course.EHRLICHMAN:And his response, as I recall it, was one oftotal surprise and there was just and, uh, and, and, he could have said then, "Oh, those jerks, I should have, you know, theyshouldn't have," or "I, I knew about itearlier.&#64258; ."He could have inferred that he know about it in a way that wouldameaningful to me but he didn`t. He wastotally nonplussed&#8211;MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.25PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211; the same as the rest of us.PRESIDENT:Well, the thing is too, that I know that,you know, when they talk about, uh, this, this business of Magruder's saying thatHaldeman had ordered it, the President hadordered it to go forward, of all the people who were surprised was, I mean, on the 17th of June-- I was in Florida--was me.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Why? Were you there? EHRLICHMAN:No, I was here. Me and Colson.PRESIDENT:Who was there?EHRLICHMAN:I called Colson--I called Ziegler and Isaid--. In this order, I called Colson, Haldeman, and Ziegler&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;and, uh, alerted them to this. PRESIDENT:Yeah. And I read the paper and I said whatin the name of God is this?EHRLICHAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:I just couldn't believe it. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:So you know what I mean is that, uh, I meanI, I believe in playing politics hard, but I'm I'm also smart. What I can't, what, what I can't understand is how Mitchellwould ever approve (unintelligible) signs itoff-- That's the thing I can't understand here. Well, Magruder I can understand doingthings. He is not a very bright fellow. Imean he is bright, but not--he doesn't think through to the end. Jesus Christ. But Mitchell knows the consequences of such.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.26HALDEMAN:Yeah, but I'll tell you what could havehappened very easily there. Mitchell wasAttorney General. He was using, legally,and sometimes (unintelligible) and using his very great capacity to wiretapand do other kinds of things everyday and you got into a mind set and you get used to that.PRESIDENT:Could be. Could be.HALDEMAN:And it doesn't , uh, you don`t regard itwith the same kind of, of, uh, feeling that-PRESIDENT:Yeah. Could be. Could be. Well, anyway.HALDEMAN:Dean says--he says--I did see Liddy, roughlyfive or six times during that period of January to, to June, and it was always on campaign legal matters. You know.PRESIDENT:Well, I know, Dean was--remember you alwayssaid Dean was, remember you told me, making all these studies of it&#8211;HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...and all.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:I believe that.HALDEMAN:He said at one of those meetings at onetime, you know, (unintelligible), I said to Liddy something about how is it going? He said he started to say I'm having, a hell ofa time getting approval on the intelligenceoperation. I says, and, and Dean says, "You know Gordon, uh, Gordon, uh, I told youthat's something I know nothing about anddon't want to know anything about, and he said that's right. Okay.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:January to June of '72. Right?MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.27HALDEMAN:Now, here`s another factor, (unintelligible)know he is following up that point. He saysas a matter of fact, the reason I called Liddyon June 19-- I said, "Now wait a minute. Youcalled Liddy on June 19?&#64258; "Yes and the reasonI did is because Kleindienst told me that Liddy had come to see him on the 18th atBurning Tree.&#64258; That was the day after thediscovery on Sunday the 18th, ah, and thepurpose of that was to tell Kleindienst he hadto get his men out of jail and all that.Kleindienst said, "I wish that God damnedLiddy would quit talking to me about this stuff.&#64258; At that time, Liddy told Kleindienstthat Mitchell had ordered it.PRESIDENT:Oh.HALDEMAN:And you don't know that that's true. All youknow is that Liddy was using that as his meansfor trying to get to the (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:You know Mitchell could be telling the truth.Liddy could be too. But Liddy would justassume he had constructiveEHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:...approval. Mitchell could say, "I, Iordered intelligence. I know I never approvedthis God damned plan.&#64258; You, you've got tofigure the lines of defenses that everybody'sgoing to take here, uh, that's Mitchell's,right? What's Haldeman's line of defense? Haldeman's line of defense, "I never approvedanything of this sort. I just "--you knowthat--What's Ehrlichman's? Ehrlichman, there'sno doubt he knows nothing about it. Theearlier thing, yes. We did have an operationfor, for leaks, and so forth. Uh, what wouldyou say if they said, "Did you ever do anywiretapping?&#64258; What would you say? There is aquestion on that. Were you aware of any wiretapping?EHRLICHINIAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:Then you would say, "Yes.&#64258; Then, "Why did youdo it?&#64258; You would say it was ordered on anational security basis.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.28EHRLICHIMAN:National security. We had, we had a seriesof very serious national security leaks.(Telephone rings)PRESIDENT:RESTRICTED-&#64257;B&#64258;MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.29RESTRICTED-&#64257;B&#64258;MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.30PRESIDENT:As you were saying on the--EHRLICHMAN:Uh, let me go back and pick up this businessabout taps, 'cause I, I think--I, I've I'vedone some checking and I want you to get a feel for what I would say if this Huntthing, slopped over on me, uh.PRESIDENT:Incidentally, my view is--I don't know Hunt.I don't think Hunt will do that.EHRLICHMAN:I don't think he will either, because--HALDEMAN:You don't think he is going to have to take&#8211;PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:&#8211;a fall for a very heavy burglary?PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:If he does-- PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:The, the, the line of, of a response wouldbe this as I see it. Starting back in thedays when I was Counsel to the President, we were very concerned about national security leaks and we undertook at that time a wholeseries of steps to try and determine thesource of leaks. Uh, some of this involved na--national security taps duly andproperly authorized and conducted, Now, wehad three very serious breaches, and, and, after I left the office of Counsel, I continued to follow this&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;at your request. We had three very seriousbreaches. Uh, one was the whole Tad Szulcgroup; uh one was the Pentagon Papersand the other was the Pakistan, uh, India, uh, uh, set, but there were others all through there and so we had a,MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.31we had an active and on-going White Houseinvolvement using the resources of the Bureau, the Agency and the various departmental security, uh, arms, uh, with White House supervision. Uh, in this particular instance, Hunt, Hunt became involved, uh, because at thetime of the Pentagon Papers break we had, we haddual concerns. We had the concern about the integrity of other documents and we had concern about the relationship of this particular leak to other security leaks that we had across the government--Rand and, and so forth--and so wemoved very vigorously on the whole cast ofcharacters in the Pentagon Papers thing. Some of our findings have never come out. Uh, it was an effort to relate that incident to the other national security breaches that we had, and also to find out as much as we could about this. We threw a number of people into this that wehad at work on other things. Among them Hunt,uh, and, uh he in turn Liddy. Uh, I didn't know and this is, this is fact. I, I checked this two or three ways. I didn't know what they were doing about this, this uh, operation in Los Angeles until after it occurredand they came to me and told me that it had beendone and that it was unsuccessful and that they were intending to make a re-entry to try and, uh, secure papers that they were after. Uh, I said no, and, and stopped it at that point. Interestingly enough, Colson called me severaltimes and remonstrated with me and tried(Reel Two Begins) to persuade me that they should go back in and Isaid no and I (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:So Colson and Hunt, then were in contact? EHRLICHMAN:Obviously, in contact and I (unintelligible)--PRESIDENT:Makes you wonder whether Colson and Hunt were incontact later.EHRLICHMAN:Well, that, that's an inference that arises.Now I have some memos from Colson to me about the Pentagon Papers problem and, uh, things that ought to be done.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.32PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:That indicate to me that he was programmingHunt at that point in time.PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Now, that he did later, I don't know.(Reel One Ends)MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.33EHRLICHMAN:Now, I never had the slightest informationthat Colson (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well, I knew that, uh, the, uh--EHRLICHMAN:Remember the Diem business? PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And., uh, and uh--PRESIDENT:Yeah. I said let's get some facts. EHRLICHMAN:Right. And so Colson and I both wereinvolved in finding this fellow Coneen, theCIA and getting his story on it.PRESIDENT:Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. EHRLICHMAN:And that's when Hunt first came in thepicture because he was a go-between betweenus and Coneen.PRESIDENT:Yeah, I see. EHRLICHMAN:And--PRESIDENT:Oh, yeah.EHRLICHMAN:And that when-- PRESIDENT:I heard about that. EHRLICHMAN:First brought him forward.PRESIDENT:I heard about that.EHRLICHIMAN:Uh, then we kept Hunt on to do variousthings.PRESIDENT:But, you know, as far as the whole thingthat, uh, it, it was not Colson, but you that I was talking, to.EHRLICHMAN:That's correct.PRESIDENT:In that case--EHRLICHMAN:That's correct. And I had no occasion totell you anything about Colson'sinvolvement&#8211;MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.34PRESIDENT:That's my point.EHRLICHMAN:Ah, Young and Krogh operated that, the wholeoperation. From the beginning as a matterof fact with the other leaks, the Tad Szulc leaks and so on and they carried on throughand, and Krogh is very frank in saying, "Iauthorized this, ah, this operation in Los Angeles, no two ways about it.&#64258; He says, uh, "If I am asked, uh," he. says, "that'swhat I'll say and I'll resign and leave theDepartment of Transportation and get out of town.&#64258; He said, &#64257;I, uh, thought at the timewe were doing the right thing and&#8211;"PRESIDENT:Should he? EHRLICHMAN:...and so forth. I don't think he`ll haveto. Number one, I don't think Hunt, uh, Idon't think Hunt will strike him. If hedid, I would, I would put the national security tent over this whole operation.PRESIDENT:I sure would.EHRLICHMAN:And say, "Look, there are a lot of thingsthat went on in the national interest there that involved taps, they involved entry,they involved interrogation, they involved alot of things and I don't, I don't propose to open that up to scrutiny."PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:Then just hard line it.PRESIDENT:I think that's what you have to do there.But I wanted to get that one out. Okay. Goahead.HALDEMAN:Right. Now, on the Commission idea, uh, getDean on that, uh, thing he proposed last night, cause I still think--he says he stillthinks it's possible and, and has a goodpossible approach. He's been trying to pick it apart. Can't do it at this point.(Unintelligible), Uh he says the approach,as he sees it, is that the President says here's what's been chargedMARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.35about the White House and about theCommittee to Re-Elect the President. Heputs it all in perspective in terms ofpolitical, you know, this kind of stuff goes on, this is all bad, without any--PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:But we are now at a point where fact andfiction are becoming badly confused. We are involved in an intense political situationwith the press, with the Senate Committee,you know, and others are prejudging this case both Ervin and Weicker and others whoare.(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:That various people will,defendants that are guilty, known to be guilty, are making charges.HALDEMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:Which, uh, should, should of course, be-- EHRLICHMAN:The FBI is being falsely charged with, uh,inadequate, uh, uh&#8211;PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;activity and duplicity and so forth. PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:The Justice Department and the U. S.Attorney's office are being, uh, uh--PRESIDENT:They're&#8211; UNIDENTIFIED:Question.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) questionable.HALDEMAN:Now, no man is above the law and that is abasic principle we must operate on, butunder these circumstances, there's nopossibility of a fair hearing and every man isMARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.36entitled to the protection of the law, andthe public is entitled to the facts in thismatter. But the people who are in charge andare involved are entitled to, fair treatment. People who are involved, or werethen accused to be. So, I'mcreating a super panel which will have the cooperation of all investigative agencies. All the people who have been charged in thismatter, have volunteered to submit theirentire, their facts, to this panel.PRESIDENT:Be questioned by it.HALDEMAN:And be questioned by it. They've agreed towaive their right to trial by jury.PRESIDENT:What (unintelligible) is that. HALDEMAN:And the panel is empowered to act to remove,anybody that it sees fit because ofinvolvement, to level fines and to impose criminal sanctions. The defendants in the in the Watergate trial, the men who havealready been, uh, can also submit anyinformation that they want.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Anyone who does not submit to theproceedings of this committee under these conditions&#8211;PRESIDENT:Resign.HALDEMAN:...will be faced with the fact that allinformation developed by the committee from all other sources will be turned over to theJustice Department for criminal prosecution.There will be no judgment until all the facts are received by the commission and then the commission will make public all of,its findings and the reasons for all actionstaken. They will proceed in secret and their decisions will be final and not subject toappeal. And the people appearing before themwill voluntarily submit to that. Right (unintelligible).MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.37PRESIDENT:What kind of an appeal? How`s that(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Uh, I don't know.EHRLICHMAN:That`s--that sounds like a little bitsimpler than that, than what I originallythought he had in mind. He says, uhPRESIDENT:Wonder if the President has the power to setup such a thing. Can he do that sort of thing? I know that the main point. I don'tthink so.EHRLICHMAN:Executive process. HALDEMAN:By voluntary (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:You get the (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, but it isn't, it isn't that guy. It'sthe fellow who doesn't submit, who in effect is being denied due process.PRESIDENT:Uh, you--you're right.HALDEMAN:The information on him will be turned overto the criminal--might be he`d be subpoenaed.PRESIDENT:No, then, you sort of condemned him by&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Negative inference. HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:&#8211;negative inference.HALDEMAN:We're all condemned by negative inferenceright now.EHRLICHMAN:I, I appreciate that, but that's--PRESIDENT:You're not condemned by a court.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.38EHRLICHMAN:Uh, it's a little different. Well, I, thatisn't, that isn't a sine qua non on thisthing. No.HALDEMAN:He feels that there are a lot of advantageson this, uh, and two major internal ones.It will take the panel a long time to getset up, get its processes worked out, get its hearings done and make its findings and then you'll probably be past the '74elections which`ll be desirable(unintelligible). Secondly, is the, the President maintains the ultimate stroke onit, because he always has the option onJanuary 19 to pardon anybody who needs a pardon. So the potential ultimate penalty anybody that would get hit in this processcould be about two years. His view would beto put--you need to get someone on the panel who knows politics. Former Governor, or something like that. But, uh, if you wouldwant Earl Warren, if he'll do it, but he'sdown in Florida. What could that matter to the people? So what are you gonna do aboutErvin? Well, you call Ervin down. You tellhim the plans and explain why you're doing it, that justice is not being carried out now, there's a finger pointing and a lot ofproblems. And you ask him to hold hishearings in abeyance until the panel serves its purpose.PRESIDENT:Ervin would say, "Well, I'll hold myhearings in abeyance on Watergate, but not on other things?"HALDEMAN:I'm guessing.PRESIDENT:That's their problem.HALDEMAN:Then you ask--MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.39PRESIDENT:Oh, that`s not-HALDEMAN:Then, what about asking Ervin to serve onthe panel. You see he thought that was avery good idea. He said he probably wouldn't do it, (unintelligible) stand on a stickyposition.The only other idea Dean comes up with is hesaid, "One thing you might want to consider is the President calling Mitchell in for aone-on-one talk. The President now has allthe facts on this (unintelligible) tell us. But I, Dean, don't know the facts onMitchell.&#64258; He said, "I thin think thatMitchell would not pull any punches with the President and if the President--that, that would be a way to find out what Mitchell'strue perception of what did and didn'thappen was."HALDEMAN:And that's probably the only--supposing youhad (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Suppose now, the fact that (unintelligible)too, my time. Suppose you call Mitchell and say to him, "Will you--what do you, what doyou learn, and uh, for what?&#64258; And Mitchellsays, "Yes, I did it.&#64258; Then what do we say?HALDEMAN:It's knowledge than we possess right now.If he would only confess (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I was just going to say, uh, maybe if Rogerssaid it to him (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Mitchell?HALDEMAN:I don't think (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Mitchell? Mitchell despises Rogers. HALDEMAN:Yeah, I know he does. Now for all it is. Ididn't call Mitchell because I-- Dean thinksthat we should go ahead with Magruder. Findout--MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.40HALDEMAN:Well, Magruder--PRESIDENT:Oh, I agree too.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) and maybe (unintelligible)He thought maybe we want to approach this problem, basically behind a conferencetable. I think that ought to wait untilafter we've had this meeting and decide--PRESIDENT:Shit, I mean&#8211; HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) and Mitchell.PRESIDENT:&#8211;Dean did the job (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Well, I say, I think any idea of a meetingbetween you and Mitchell ought to wait untilthe Magruder, Haldeman, Mitchell meeting.PRESIDENT:Oh, really? EHRLICHMAN:And., ah, and see what transpires there.Maybe the idea is that Magruder says hispiece and leaves and then you talk toMitchell.PRESIDENT:What about the other way around? EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Seeing about me getting Mitchell in and say,"Look, (unintelligible) you've got to (unintelligible) uh, tell us what the storyis, John. You have to face up to where weare here. What did this guy say? What are you gonna say? How do we handle it and so forth."HALDEMAN:My guess is Mitchell would stonewall. Ithink Mitchell would say, &#64257;Mr. President, if it will serve any useful purpose for you Iwould come--" (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Isn't it as well, for me though to give acall (unintelligible) and ask him to meetMARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.41with Magruder? Or what do you think,John?...EHRLICHMAN:I have had from --PRESIDENT:I have not really had fromMitchell, but I've had from Haldeman, I'vehad from Ehrlichman, and I've had fromColson cold, flat denials. I have asked each of you to tell me, and also from Dean. Now the President, therefore, has not liedon this and I, I don't think that yethas been charged. A lot of others have been charged, but they haven't charged thePresident with any offense. They are not,uh, in trying to protect his people who are lying. But I don't, uh, does, does anybody suggest that Iprobably did this whole damn thing?HALDEMAN:As of now it is all saying that you're&#8211; PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:&#8211;being ill-served by (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:By my people. But I don`t know aboutMitchell. I never asked him.HALDEMAN:Stick him. It can't hurt anything.(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Get Mitchell down. What do I ask him? HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:What I've got to do is think in terms of myown plans. I've got to, I'll spend my daytoday on this, but I'll have to clear thedeck for tomorrow (unintelligible/REMOVED).EHRLICHMAN:Uh, you say, uh, I've just had to make anassurance on John Dean. They tell me that I'm going to eventually have to make some assurances where you're concerned. What doI do?PRESIDENT:Here is what, uh, Magruder is saying, uh--MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.42EHRLICHMAN:Magruder is saying?PRESIDENT:Uh, I know, I think I will tell him herewhat Magruder is saying. I don't knowreally know what he is saying about the White House, but I understand he`S saying,he is saying that you signed off on it. Isthat what Magruder is saying?HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) goes public on this, thenyou know--PRESIDENT:Incidentally, if Magruder doe's that, let'ssee what it does to Magruder.EHRLICHMAN:It depends on how he does it. If he does itunder immunity, it doesn't do anything tohim.PRESIDENT:All right, except ruin him. HALDEMAN:Well, yeah.PRESIDENT:He's got--oh, yes.HALDEMAN:It ruins him in a way he becomes a, hebecomes a folk hero to the media.PRESIDENT:He becomes a hero with the media. Let metell you in terms of--I know how thesethings work.EHRLICHMAN:But, but&#8211;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;Mike Wallace will get him and he will go on"Sixty Minutes," and he will come&#8211;PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;across as the All American Boy who wasdoing his, uh, who, who...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;just doing his thing--MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.43HALDEMAN:His President.EHRLICHMAN:And his Attorney General and they misledhim.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, he can do it.PRESIDENT:So--HALDEMAN:And look at the alternative that he nowsees. It is either that or he goes to jail on perjury.PRESIDENT:How are they going to prove it?EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's the other thing. With otherwitnesses, not through his own mouth.PRESIDENT:What other witnesses?HALDEMAN:Beats me. I don't know how they can proveperjury.PRESIDENT:Hunt?HALDEMAN:He has to be a afraid they can because heknows--let's assume--he knows he did perjure himself&#8211;PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:&#8211;and if you know that you are guilty, youhave to be pretty concerned about someone's ability to prove it.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And Liddy and McCord and Sloan. Now that,that little thing in McCord's letter about Sloan has to worry him.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:If it's about Sloan. Well, that's anotherthought. It may be about Barker, uh--MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.44EHRLICHMAN:Is he (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:And it is more likely because Barker workedfor him.EHRLICHMAN:I see. Yeah.HALDEMAN:Uh, Barker said he couldn't remember who hedelivered the tap reports to.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know whether he ever talked toMitchell about this but the one thing aboutMitchell, that really worries me is that hiswife is gonna get up someday and say something on that her&#8211;PRESIDENT:Ervin.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;husband. She's rattling the cage againapparently (unintelligible) whether Ervin will subpoena her&#8211;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN&#8211;what are you doing, what's happening?Uh, the other thing that canhappen is that either the Grand Jury or theCommittee will subpoena him.PRESIDENT:Her, EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:She, she doesn't know anything.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'm not so sure. PRESIDENT:You think Mitchell could have told her? EHRLICHMAN:Either that or she listens on the phone. Weknow she listens on the phone.PRESIDENT:Well. EHRLICHMAN:She can put two and two together and she cango in on pure hearsay.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.45EHRLICHMAN:Just say, well I know what they were doing.She&#8211;PRESIDENT:(unintelligible) can't testify againstMagruder, against her husband, but, uh--EHRLICHMAN:Uh, but no, but, uh, she could go in. Shewouldn't want to. She go and testifyagainst everybody else, including you. She hates Kleindienst with a purple passion well, see, uh, he took her husband`s jobaway from him.PRESIDENT:Shit. EHRLICHMAN:She'd better start now.PRESIDENT:It's her husband that wanted to leave.EHRLICHMAN:But you can't persuade her of that. PRESIDENT:I see. EHRLICHMAN:She bad mouths him up one side and down theother every chance she gets. So&#8211;PRESIDENT:Oh, I agree that's part of it when youreally come down to it, but a woman is more responsible than anything else for theproblem we've got here. Without her, Johnwould have tended the store a little better. I really think so.EHLRICHMAN:Well, she's, uh, she's a wild card in thiswhole thing.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, I think, uh you -- talk to himabout that. I can't talk to him. I thinkhe stonewalls me, but, uh, I think it's worth talking to him about, uh, if he reallyis going to try to tough this through and,uh--PRESIDENT:EHRLICHMAN:RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.46EHRLICHMAN:And that's a terrible thing. I, uh, I thinkif he were faced with that reality, uh, he would, uh&#352;PRESIDENT:Well, what is Mitchell's option though? You mean to say, uh let`s, see what he coulddo. Does Mitchell come in and say, "Myfault&#8211;My memory was faulty. I lied?&#64258; No. He can't say that.EHRLICHMAN:He says, uh, uh--PRESIDENT:"That I may have given a-- without intendingto, I may have given, been responsible for this, and I, I regret it very much, but Idid not intend that, I did not realize whatthey were up to. They, they were talking, we were talking about apples and oranges.&#64258; That&#8482;s what I think he would say. Don't you agree?HALDEMAN:I think. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. HALDEMAN:He authorized apples and they boughtoranges. YeahPRESIDENT:Mitchell, you see, is never, never going togo in and admit perjury. I mean you can,uh, talk about immunity and all the rest,but he's never going to do that.HALDEMAN:They won't give him immunity anyway, Iwouldn't think, unless they figure theycould get you. He is as high up as they`vebeen.EHRLICHMAN:He's the big Enchilada.HALDEMAN:And he's the one the magazines zeroed in onthis weekend.PRESIDENT:They did? Uh, what grounds? That he knew? HALDEMAN:Well, just a quote that they maybe have abig fish on the hook.PRESIDENT:I think Mitchell should come down.(Unintelligible).MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.47EHRLICHMAN:To see you, me, Magruder.PRESIDENT:Yeah. We'll have him come down at 5:30.Tell him that there's, there`s, tell himthat Magruder's (unintelligible). Come down I'd like to talk to him (unintelligible). Iwould like to talk with him, with you,Magruder and he -- is that who you mean? -- and Dean -- no, no.HALDEMAN:Well, Magruder said he would be happy tohave Dean sit in. It's my view, I don'tthink we want Dean to sit in.PRESIDENT:Alright, well alright, (Unintelligible) Sitdown and have it (unintelligible) then weshould have my talk.HALDEMAN:I would think so. I think that would bevery constructive.PRESIDENT:Magruder has got to know that I, I justdon't, that my own feeling is, Bob, the reason I raise the question of Magruder is what stroke have you got with Magruder? Iguess we've got none.EHRLICHMAN:I think that, I think that the stroke Bobhas with him is that the, in theconfrontation to say, "Jeb, you know thatjust plain isn't so," and, uh, uh, just stare him down on some of this stuff and it's a golden opportunity to do that and Imean, uh, and I think you will only havethis one opportunity to do it.HALDEMANCourse he`s told me it isn't so before.EHRLICHMAN:That's all the better, but I, in his presentframe of mind I'm sure he`s rationalized himself into a, into a fable that hangs together and--But if he knows that you aregoing to righteously and indignantly denyit, uh--PRESIDENT:Say that he's trying to lie to save his ownskin.EHRLICHMAN:It'll, it'll bend, uh, it'll bend him.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.48HALDEMAN:Well. then I can make a personal point ofview in the other direction, and say, "Jeb,for God's sake don't get yourself screwed upby&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Yes.HALDEMAN:&#8211;solving one lie with a second."EHRLICHMAN:That's right. HALDEMAN:"You've got a problem. You ain't going tomake it better by making it worse."PRESIDENT:Yeah, he'll be a hero for the moment, but,ah, in the minds of --HALDEMAN:Well then you've got, then you've gotMagruder facing all&#8211;PRESIDENT:Let me tell you something&#8211; HALDEMAN:&#8211;the choices. PRESIDENT:&#8211;let me tell you something. Uh, I have beenwanting to tell you this for some time(unintelligible) always dealing with the informer, good causes are destroyed. Chambers is a case in point. Chambers toldthe truth, but he was an informer, obviouslyit was because he was informed against Hiss, that they made it worse for him, but itdidn't make any difference if he(unintelligible). First of all, he was an (unintelligible) informed and, uh, Hiss was destroyed because he lied--committedperjury. Chambers was destroyed because hewas an informer, but Chambers knew he was going to be destroyed. Now, they`ve got toknow--Magruder's got to know that this wholebusiness of McCord going down this road and so forth. . Uh, I don't know what, I don't know what the (unintelligible):EHRLICHMAN:McCord is a strange bird.PRESIDENT:He's trying to get out. I have never methim. Ever meet him?MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.49EHRLICHMAN:Nope. But, uh, Dean--PRESIDENT:Tell me about him.HALDEMAN:Let's go another one. So, so you persuadeMagruder that his present approach is (a) not true; I think you can probably persuadehim of that; and (b) net desirable to fake.So he then says, in despair, "Hey, what do I do? Here's McCord out here accusing me. McCord has flatly accused me of perjury.He`s flatly accused Dean of complicity.&#64258;Dean is going to go, and Magruder knows as a fact that Dean wasn't involved, so he know`sthat Dean is clean, he knows when Dean goesdown, Dean can testify as an honest man.PRESIDENT:But, is Dean going to finger, uh, Magruder? HALDEMAN:No, sir.PRESIDENT:There's the other point.HALDEMAN:Dean will not finger Magruder but Dean can'teither. "Likewise, he can't defend Magruder.PRESIDENT:Well--Alright.HALDEMAN:Dean won't, Dean won't (unintelligible)Magruder. But Magruder then says, "Okay, ifDean goes down to the Grand Jury and clears,clears himself, there's no evidence against him except McCord's statement, which won't hold up, and it isn't true."PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:"Now, I go down to the Grand Jury, becauseobviously they are going to call me backPRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:"&#8211;and I go to defend myself against McCord'sstatement which I know is true. Now I`ve a little tougher problem than Dean has.You're saying to me don't make up a new lieto cover up the old one. What would you recommend that I do do? Stay with the oldMARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.50lie and hope I would come out, or clean myselfup and go to jail?"PRESIDENT:What do&#8211;HALDEMAN:Or what?PRESIDENT:&#8211;you advise? What would you advise him to do?HALDEMAN:I, I'd advise him to go down and clean it up. PRESIDENT:And say "I lied?"HALDEMAN:Say, "I lied.&#64258; I would advise him to seekimmunity and do it.PRESIDENT:Do you think&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:If he can get immunity?&#8211;HALDEMAN:Absolutely.PRESIDENT:Then what would he say? EHRLICHMAN:Say, "I thought I was helping. Uh, it'sobvious that, uh, there is no profit in thisroute, uh, uh. I did it on my own motive.Nobody asked me to do it. I just did itbecause I thought it was the best thing to dofrom everybody's standpoint and I was wrong todo it.&#64258; That's basically it.HALDEMAN:Magruder's viewpoint that to be ruined thatway, which isn't really being ruined, is infinitely preferable to going to jail. Goingto jail for Jeb will be a very, very, verydifficult&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well, if it's a --EHRLICHNAN:Well Magruder doesn't seem to be(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:'Magruder is a very unusual person. HALDEMAN:(Laughs) Yep.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:The question is whether the U.S. Attorney willgrant immunity under the circumstances.HALDEMAN:Well, he would if he thought he was going toget Mitchell.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.51HALDEMANThe interesting thing is, would be, would beto watch Mitchell's face at the time I, Irecommend to Magruder that he go down andask for immunity and confess. (Pause)PRESIDENT:Go on with this, uh, go on with thisCommission.EHRLICHMAN:Step on that it seems to me is to sell BillRogers on the idea, if it's a good idea.HALDEMAN:The, the other, first thing is to talk withBill Rogers and see whether he comes up with a decent committee.EHRLICHMAN:Well I'd say first we've got to be convincedthat it's a good idea. If the President's satisfied that it is a good idea, then we'll get Bill Rogers to (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well you see, to make it is--the problemthat we`ve got here as, we've gotta, we've gotta, uh, everybody (unintelligible) felt that the time and energy put into this thing(unintelligible) the amount of time that Ishould spend with Bill and Mitchell and so forth (unintelligible) necessary Rogers uh,how do we open that. Do you want to open it(unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;glory in this for Bill (unintelligible).This is his idea (unintelligible) clean.HALDEMAN:You see you're, you're saying Bill wouldpublicly be the father of this.EHRLICHMAN:Bill would be the father of this. He'd goto Ervin and say, "I'm terribly concernedabout&#8211;PRESIDENT:He'd be the broker EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;this whole business, uh, uh."HALDEMAN:He came to the President and said this iswhat you must do.PRESIDENT:Go to Warren?MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.52EHRLICHMAN:He`d go to Ervin and say I see this, thisimpasse developing between the Grand Juryand (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Might go to Judge Sirica? EHRLICHMAN:I don't think he would. Sirica`s smart.HALDEMAN:I., I've heard of that.EHRLICHMAN:But why not ask him? HALDEMAN:Sure. EHRLICHMAN:That's fine. Either that or go to Burger orgo to, uh, somebody in the, in the JudicialBranch and, uh, have them designate two, uh, senior Judges from around the country whoare retired, uh, trial judge types. Andjust designate them at random. It takes it out of your hands. Ah, they represent the judicial and., uh--PRESIDENT:Yeah, and not have Warren?EHRLICHMAN:And, and not have Warren. No, no. PRESIDENT:Warren is so old, you see. EHRLICHMAN:He scares me to death.HALDEMAN:Then you'd have to ask the uh&#8211;PRESIDENT:The War&#8211; HALDEMAN:&#8211;the speak&#8211;PRESIDENT:&#8211;the Warren thing.HALDEMAN:&#8211;the speaker and the Majority Leader. PRESIDENT:No. EHRLICHMAN:No, they've already done that.PRESIDENT:The Congress--EHRLICHMAN:They've already done that. I think you areoff the hook on that.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.53HALDEMAN:You mean invite Ervin and Baker?EHRLICHMAN:You invite Ervin and Baker and if theydecline, then that's the whole story of theCongress.PRESIDENT:Then just have the two con--, uh, the twosenior Judges.EHRLICHMAN:The two senior judges and, uh-- PRESIDENT:Why not just have a panel of senior judgesrather than try to get--you talk about theformer Attorneys General and so forth,you've got them (unintelligible) their problem.HALDEMAN:I would take your, take senior judges.PRESIDENT:You see, if, uh, we asked, uh, the ChiefJustice if he would designate a panel of three, a panel of three senior judges, orfour, --Clark.EHRLICHMAN:Maybe Clark, Clark as the chairman. HALDEMAN:Clark as chairman. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Clark is a Democrat and a former AttorneyGeneral. He`d be the Chairman.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible),PRESIDENT:RiqhtHALDEMAN:And then you, uh-- PRESIDENT:A panel of three I think would make a lot ofsense. Now they have to have a staff. Howdo we finance that? The Justice Department?the Justice Department (Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Clark's (unintelligible) lawyer all over.He's got an office over here in the FederalBuilding, and, uh--PRESIDENT:They would, they would hire, uh whatever,their own counsel (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:What that does is to tend to one up&#8211;MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.54PRESIDENT:Ervin.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;Ervin and the Grand Jury with yet a thirdinvestigatory group.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:It seems to me, that, if it is just seniorjudges, you miss the genius of the thing andthat its got to be executive, legislative, and judicial.PRESIDENT:Speaking of (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Why executive? Executive is what's on top.EHRLICHMAN:Well, executive in a sense that, uh, uh, youhave citizen members. You know, the publicis represented. It`s the government, thewhole, the whole question of integrity (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I think that if you get Congress, if you,better if you get just judges. I think apanel of judges isn't all that bad either. A good standing (unintelligible) panel of three judges.EHRLICHMAN:I don't think it sells, though.PRESIDEINT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:That's the trouble.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:I mean, it, it, then you, all you look likeyou're you look like you're dragging a red herring across the trail. Uh, you have tohave some kind of a ration, uh,uh, (unintelligible) Bill.HALDEMAN:Bill, might now, now does undoubtedly-- someideas on it, too.EHRLICHMAN:Maybe we, uh--MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.55PRESIDENT:Prominent Americans.HALDEMAN:But then it has a reason for being and has areason for pre-empting.PRESIDENT:What about making Clark chairman? HALDEMAN:The former, both executive and legisla-- andjudicial type, and then have two seniorjudges plus Ervin and Baker. There's the thing.PRESIDENT:Well, anyway let's, let's talk aboutthis, uh, (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I think in principle, though, getting a linearound this whole subject is terriblyimportant at this point rather than justbleeding this every day for hours at a time.HALDEMAN:Sending John Dean to the Grand Jury-- PRESIDENT:Oh, I understand that, I understand that. Mypoint is, John, I don't think we could getit. People say, you gotta got it out tonight for example. It isn't going to be done tonight or tomorrow night. We just, wejust, we can't get it done that fast.HALDEMAN:I don't think you want to anyway. I thinkyou want to end the war and freeze&#8211;PRESIDENT:Uh, (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:&#8211;food prices first, and then do this. PRESIDENT:I wish it were Friday. HALDEMAN:Friday is the time to do it.PRESIDENT:That means we've gotta get going today. All right, whose talks to, uh, who talks to, uh, should, uh, should John Ehrlichman andyou talk to Bill Rogers, or is that a wasteof time?MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.56HALDEMAN:As of now John should not, because Bill isvery concerned about not talking to peopleabout it. I already have, and I think Ishould.PRESIDENT:Right. Fine. All right, you get John--HALDEMAN:he may--PRESIDENT:You get, you get Bill to come over. Say youwant to talk to him first and that I want to talk to him. Fair enough? But you will sayhe comes over to see me. The second pointis that, uh, call Mitchell. Maybe you better make these calls now so I will knowwhat the hell my schedule is this afternoon.EHRLICHMAN:I'm going to be seeing Kleindienst on this,uh&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;on other subjects.PRESIDENT:All right. HALDEMAN:This is Haldeman. Will you get me JohnMitchell?PRESIDENT:What do we want Kleindienst to do?EHRLICHMAN:Do you want me to raise this thought withhim in a hypothetical way?PRESIDENT:Kleindienst's judgment isn't worth a darn.Alright.RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;Uh, the onlything I would say on Kleindienst at themoment is, uh, uh, tell him, because we,because we're going to have to break withGray who's killing us (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:That's one thing, I think whether or not--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) know what Gray's going todo. Can you really, can we really handle it that way?EHRLICHMAN:And how we run the Bureau and, uh--PRESIDENT:Yeah, who runs it (unintelligible) the otherthing is, uh, I don't know what KleindienstMARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.57knows or believes about this damn case.HALDEMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:I once said to John or to Kleindienst, Isaid, "You know the man they're really after here is, uh, is John Mitchell." He said, &#64257;0h, no, they are not after John Mitchell."I said, "Did you ever talk to him about it?" He said he has never discussed the damn thing with Mitchell.HALDEMAN:Well, God damn it, he talked to Weicker. NowWeicker's out today with another statement of, of, uh--PRESIDENT:What did he say today?HALDEMAN:He has absolute proof that it goes to theWhite House staff and, uh, he's not going to name names until he gets his evidence inhand but something will turn up any day.(Noise)PRESIDENT:Well, what&#352;Kleindienst--uh, well, raise thatwith him again.EHRLICHMAN:Well, Weicker (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) Weicker (unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:He ought to say--PRESIDENT:He ought to say (unintelligible)--ask forthis informationHALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) the Senator told mehe didn't have any. Now he is back out inthe press again. I don't understand that.PRESIDENT:Well, who is, who does Weicker? Who does hethink he's been talking about?HALDEMAN:I haven't any idea. Uh, I don't know. Idon't know who it can be.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.58PRESIDENT:Maybe it's this, uh, maybe, uh, Magrudertalked to Weicker. You think so, you think.Huh?HALDEMAN:I don't think so. PRESIDENT:I don't know how he's getting it.HALDEMAN:I don't think Magruder's talking to anybodyyet. I don't think so.PRESIDENT:Then where's Weicker getting(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:McCord's talked to everybody he can,including Mary McGrory, uh, uh.PRESIDENT:McCord, McCord at the presenttime only fingers. His present finger ispointed only at two people, Dean and Magruder&#8211;Correct?EHRLICHMAN:So far.PRESIDENT:So far.EHRLICHMAN:And of all people, McCord would be in aposition, I would think, to involve Mitchell. He spent all that time withMitchell and Martha.PRESIDENT:But the question is, the question is whetherMcCord has got anything on the White Housestaff.EHRLICHMAN:Hell, no. Hell, no. PRESIDENT:That is--Have you talked to McCord?(Unintelligible) I, I do think thatKleindienst has got to take up the(unintelligible) on this&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:&#8211;business of, uh, Weicker right away. Again,he's out again today, uh, uh, uh.EHRLICHMAN:Did Weicker have much to do with Gray?MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.59HALDEMAN:Yes. He's a friend of Gray.PRESIDENT:Huh.EHRLICHMAN:Might have come from Gray. I don't know.HALDEMAN:Weicker has very much to do with Gray.Weicker is Gray's sponsor. Weicker wasagainst the White House before they sunkGray and Weicker has issued a very vicious statement about us that this doesn't reach to the President, but it sure gets to thosesons-of-bitches around him, and I think healmost uses the words sons-of-bitches. It's a, it`s as close to it as he could get.PRESIDENT:Weicker says that?HALDEMAN:Terrible people around him, evil men. PRESIDENT:Have you thought about Colson? HALDEMAN:Could be. That's what Dean thinks.PRESIDENT:Dean thinks Weicker is talking about Colson?HALDEMAN:Yeah, I think he does. He thinks it'sChuck. (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Do you think Gray could be talking toWeicker? John, does Gray have a problemwith Colson?EHRLICHMAN:Not that I&#8211;HALDEMAN:I don't think he has.PRESIDENT:John, uh, you'd have no problems in callingPat Gray and asking him what the hell Weicker is up to. Do you mind? You mind?EHRLICHMAN:Not at all.PRESIDENT:I think you should, uh, we got, uh, we gottasay, "Look, we can't understand what you're,what you're doing on this thing. We, uh, ifthere is anybody, the President wants to know."MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.60HALDEMAN:Why the hell does he tell the newspapersinstead of telling somebody else?PRESIDENT:And, and ask, ask him, as the Director ofthe FBI, to ask Weicker what it, what it is. He's, uh, he's, uh, he's, he, he, as theDirector of the FBI, is supposed to get allthe information he can now. If there's anybody. And the President wants the information. I wanna put it, let's try toget to Weicker through Gray. Uh, would you,would you mind trying that, and trying that? I think, I'd like you to try that very soon&#8211;HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:&#8211;like, like on the phone. EHRLICHMAN:Right away. PRESIDENT:You go try that out on Weicker. What timedo you go to see Kleindienst?EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. They were setting it&#8211; PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;up when I came over here.PRESIDENT:Alright. You're going to set up a meetingwith (unintelligible) right now.HALDEMAN:Mitchell first. Get him first.PRESIDENT:Alright.HALDEMAN:Fine. PRESIDENT:Uh, you know John, let me add that, let mego by one other thing here that, uh,(unintelligible). I was pointing out that,uh, (unintelligible) and so forth (unintelligible). Of course, of courseyou've got to change Gray. You know that.Kleindienst, I don't want you, I don't, I think you got to ride with that a while. I don't think you can just kick the AttorneyGeneral out like that, you know. He wasgoing to go anyway at a certain time, so he can go. Beyond that, I think, I think thepoint is to say thatMARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.61members of the White House staff who arecalled in and so forth, they wouldn't haveto, Dean would have to take a leave ofabsence, uh, suspended leave of absence. (Unintelligible) You would have to, or Bobwould have to in the event you were named.I think they'd have to mention cutting off at the pass some place here and let me, uh, uh, let me put it this way and the spectacleof just taking the whole God damned WhiteHouse staff on. If this goes too far (unintelligible). There's some place whereyou've got to set them off.HALDEMAN:Well, once you establish it, that you arefollowing that route, if they were smart, they would just start naming everybody justso you'd, you'd&#8211;PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) except that. EHRLICHMAN:What, what I'm getting at here and, maybethat isn't the way to do it, I don't know,is to insulate you, number one&#8211;PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;from these people to make you appear to beahead of the power curve mounted and also tohave some symbolic act of absolution after the thing is over, by being able to take, taking them back on. And say, "All right,we've been through the whole thing. Theyfired the worst they had, but didn't make the case. I'm taking this guy back and re-instating him with full status.

Well uncomfortable, not difficult. At least let's not have mescheduled on Thursday. (Laughs) Keep oneday open. It takes a little preparation. Although I've been doing reasonably well.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.67(MATERIAL UNRELATED TO PRESIDENTIAL ACTIONSDELETED)PRESIDENT:Anybody else that you can think of, to mullover this plan? Rogers is coming in at three. Well, well--EHRLICHMAN:I will see Kleindienst. That's&#8211;PRESIDENT:You'll see Kleiridienst? EHRLICHMAN: &#8211;settled. PRESIDENT: When?EHRLICHMAN:This afternoon at three o'clock.PRESIDENT:Three o'clock, and then I think-- HALDEMAN:Should I also see Kleindiesnt?PRESIDENT: Huh?HALDEMAN:Yeah. Should I--or should John be the onlyone?PRESIDENT:John you do it. That's what Mitchell,Mitchell was asking.HALDEMAN:Mitchell is very distressed that Kleindienstisn't stepping up to his job as the contact with the Committee, getting Baker programmedand all that, A, and B, that he isn`tgetting, you see Dean got turned off by the Grand Jury. Dean is not getting theinformation from Silbert on those thingssaid at the Grand Jury. And Mitchell finds that absolutely incompetence and says it is Kleindienst's responsibility(unintelligible) He's supposed to be sendingus (unintelligible).MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.68PRESIDENT:John, put it on the basis that you're notasking, so it doesn't look like the WhiteHouse is asking; that John Mitchell says-you've got to have this information for the Grand Jury (unintelligible). Put it righton that basis, now, so that he--everybodycan't then say the White House raised hell about this, because we are not raising hell. He shouldn`t Kleindienst shouldn't--whereare you going to see him, there or here?EHRLICHMAN:In my office. PRESIDENT:Explain with him about how much you want totell him about everything.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, I, I-- PRESIDENT:I think you've flatly got to say, "Look,look--" I think you flatly got to say,"Look, Dick, let me tell you--Dean was notinvolved--had no prior knowledge--Haldeman had no prior knowledge; you, Ehrlichman, had none; and Colson had none. Now, unless--andthey're--all told that the president and ifyou have any information to the contrary you want to know. You've got to know it, butyou've got to say too, that there is seriousquestion here being raised about Mitchell. Right? Now that's about all...Ya see, Magruder is playing--the game, thegame is interesting here. McCord isthrowing off on Magruder and Dean. Why he picked Dean, I don't know.Why did he pick Dean? Except that Dean wasin the news I guess.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.69Now wait a minute. All right, now what isMagruder's doing? Magruder. What'sshocking to me is that he's playing offagainst the one area that I wouldn't think he would play off--against Haldeman.HALDEMAN:Yeah. Yeah. Because he had thought about--PRESIDENT:He didn't pick Strachan. Nobody gives ashit about Strachan, but they care a hell of a lot about Haldeman.HALDEMAN:You'd think he`d--PRESIDENT:And then Magruder, Magruder was made byHaldeman.EHRLICHMAN: Yeah.PRESIDENT:And he knows and he also knows it's nottrue.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, I--I--PRESIDENT:I can't figure it out.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I wouldn't be surprised if, uh, McCordhad been led by Committee Counsel. All the stuff about--PRESIDENT:Dash?EHRLICHMAN:Uh, yeah. All the stuff about Dean comes inthe LA Times story. Yeah, it doesn't comein the Mc Cord letter.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:And Dean is the logical target of the, ofthe Committee.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.70PRESIDENT:How do you analyze Magruder, uh, tossing itoff to you rather than to Mitchell? I meandid that surprise you?HALDEMAN:Well, he hits Mitchell too. I think he'strying to wrap me because he wants to getyou in. I think, uh, my view is that whatMagruder was doing here was firing a threat rather than an intent to say it--I don't think he intends to use that so much as heintended--he's trying to get. people shookup.PRESIDENT:He isn't asking to see me is he?EHRLICHMAN:Oh, no. He's trying, he's trying to get theline around you for his own protection.HALDEMAN:(Unintel1igible)In other words, if all Magruder is going todo is take the dive himself, then we aren'tgoing to care about it, if he makes, if he makes us worry that he's going to get...PPLESIDENT:John&#8211;HALDEMAN:&#8211;Mitchell, you and me.PREESIDENT:&#8211;do you see any way though, any way, thatMagruder can stick to his story? No.EHRLICHMAN:Yes, because he's an, he's an ingenious ...PRESIDENT:Stick to the story? Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;He is an ingenious witness, uh, uh--Ithink. I'm told. If he is really as goodas he is, uh, as they say he is as awitness, its possible he could get away with it. Uh, it's, it's arguable.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.71PRESIDENT:So, that its his word against McCord.EHRLICHMAN:And, and he is flowing with the stream, yousee, he's, he's saying the things they wanthim to say.PRESIDENT:No. No. No. NO. No. No. No. No. Idon't mean if he says, if I, I mean--EHRLICHMAN:Oh, if he sticks to his old story&#352;I see, Isee.PRESIDENT:No.EHRLICHMAN:I thought you meant the story he's layingout here.PRESIDENT:Oh, no. No. This story. No. No. No.No. No. No. No. They'd take that in aminute.EHRLICHMAN:I tell ya I am, I`m to the point now where Idon`t think, this thing is going to holdtogether, and my hunch is that anybody whotries to stick with a story that is not susceptible to corroboration is in, going to be in serious difficulty.PRESIDENT:So, what do you feel then?EHRLICHMAN:Well, that is why I said I thought he oughtto move to a, a real and immune confessionof perjury if he can do it. There's toomany crosscurrents in this thing now.PRESIDENT:Yeah. This is my view that(unintelligible), I'm sure he checked itout. If Magruder is going to say that--thenwhat the hell is in it for him?EHRLTCHMAN:Immunity.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.72PRESIDENT:Well, if he gets immunity&#352;Good&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...Good God! Can't--Do we have--can't theU.S. (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:We've not enough influence.PRESIDENT:Who grants immunity? The judges? EHRLICHMAN:Sirica grants immunity in the Grand Juryproceedings.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Uh Ervin grants it in Congressionalproceedings and the Attorney General can grantit in anything.PRESIDENT:Could the Attorney General grant it in theCongressional?EHRLICHMAN:No. No, but what he does there is informallywork out with the Congress&#8211;PRESIDENT:YeahEHRLICHMAN:&#8211;the tendency of Justice Department action.PRESIDENT:I see.(MATERIAL UNRELATED TO PRESIDENTIAL ACTIONSDELETED)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) anything new at this point.You've got (unintelligible). You inform me ifyou got something on Gray, uh, Weicker--EHRLICHMAN:Yeah&#8211;PRESIDENT:Inform me as soon as you got something onKleindienst, alright?EHRLICHMAN:Alright.PRESIDENT:I have a real woodshed (unintelligible)Mitchell God damned disappointed. you know,he'll just jump up and down and shout(unintelligible). Let's level, I'm gonnalevel with him. This is, this is a bad raphere. We're not going to allow it. Our realproblem is Mitchell. Now what about this?What are you going to do about it? What areyou going to get out of it? He knows God damnwell,MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.73Mitchell is right. Of course, we ought toknow, Can't the Attorney General call in,uh, Silbert, or is that too dangerous forhim?EHRLICHMAN:Well, he doesn't have to do that--ah, HenryPetersen follows that thing on a dailybasis.PRESIDENT:Henry. Petersen? EHRLICHMAN:Henry can let Dick know, and that's allthere is to it.PRESIDENT:Alright. You just tell Dick. Alright. Yousee the problem is, there, that Dick thinksI am - if he says he has furnished the GrandJury things to the White House that there's a problem.EHRLICHMAN:It's a tender, it's a tender point. I thinkwhat he has to do--(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:No, you could say this. What does he neednow that--our interest here--you could say is whether any White House people areinvolved&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:&#8211;and we will move on them.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. And the President wants toknow--PRESIDENT:That he, that that's what he, that, that'sthe purpose. We're not interested inprotecting anybody. We want to know whatthe hell they're saying.EHRLICHMAN:Absolutely. That's the only basis on whichto negotiate.PRESIDENT:We get that today? EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Get it every day so that we can move onestep ahead here. We want to move. We'renot going to wait til a Grand Jury drags them up there.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.74EHRLICHMAN:OK. I'll let you know as soon as that's done.PRESIDENT:I wonder if we aren't, if we're in a positionto, to talk with Rogers and, so forth and allthe evidence.EHRLICHMAN:Judge Sirica. What the, that`s, in effect,what you would do if you sent everybody down to the Grand JuryPRESIDENT:I see,EHRLICHMAN:I think the judge does not have&#352;PRESIDENT:You don't think sending them to the Grand Juryis a viable option?EHRLICHMAN:This idea doesn't&#8211;PRESIDENT:I mean, I'm just thinking. I, I know settingup these commissions are so difficult so--Well, we'll see, see what Weicker says.EHRLICHMAN:Well, think about it in these terms. If youcame out Friday and said, "OK, I wanta, I'llget this thing cleared up, so I'm going tosend every man jack in this White House staffdown to the Grand Jury&#352;PRESIDENT:To hang (unintelligible) terrible, terrible.Sure. Sure, (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;Anybody who knows anything about this, either directly or indirectly. And, uh, I'mcalling on the judge -- I've talked to thejudge and he assured me it will be done veryexpeditiously and, uh--PRESIDENT:What I was thinking, you see, as, as, as analternative. The judge is now coming out as a white knight here. The judge is a, is, is andincidentally, he, we can say in a sense thatthe judge has given a sentence of 55 years tosomebody who, who had no former, formeroffense and so forth and so on&#8211;HALDEMAN:Ridiculuous. (Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:&#8211;but the reason the judge is going into thismuch deeper, is because he thinks there is acover.HALDEMAN:Certainly.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.75PRESIDENT:Uh--HALDEMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:I don't think you can hold that against thejudge. You know, I, I, I do in a way, but youknowEHRLICHMAN:He's the proprietor of a court room and he&#8211; PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;tries to&#8211;PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;to, to conduct a good trial to get(unintelligible). That`s what it is.PRESIDENT:Yeah. The point is, is while I've--another(unintelligible) what we're doing here tonight is the problem--I'm going to try to set upanother procedure, call the judge in and say,"Judge, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll,we'll, we'll will carry out this investigationby sending them all down here and, uh, you canquestion them. I want everybody here and Iwant, I want you to get to the bottom of thisthing. You will have my total backing.&#64258; Nowthat is another way to do that.EHRLICHMAN:That's OK. As long as you then get out infront.PRESIDENT:No. I didn't say--EHRLICHMAN:You say to the country&#8211;PRESIDENT:No.EHRLICHMAN: &#64257;I`ve now had this conversation&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:"&#8211;with the judge--"RRESIDENT: Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:The thing that I got, that&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well, that's what I mean.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;that's what I would say. The thing that Iget over, over and over again from justordinary folks&#8211;MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.76PRESIDENT:Alright.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;on this subject is, "Why doesn't thePresident," so and so and so and so.PRESIDENT:Say something what's he done on it? EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. So symbolically you've got to dosomething.PRESIDENT:That's right. Do something so that I'm outfront on this every--EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:They don't think the President is involvedbut they don't think he`d doing any--doing anything to clean it up.EHRLICHMAN:That's it. That's it.PRESIDENT:No matter how often we say we willcooperate--the FBI (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:They're not going to believe that at all.EHRLICHMAN:It`s not getting through. Ziegler is notsufficiently credible on this.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:In a sense, because--PRESIDENT:What about the judge business? Let's look atit that way, rather than at the commission.EHRLICHMAN:Well, then, then what you've got is you'vesaid, "I'll send John Dean; I'll send Haldeman; I'll send everybody to the Grand Jury. No immunity. Just send them downthere to testify. Let it all, let it allcome out."PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Grand Jury?EHRLICHMAN:It's up to him to grap them where,people(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:You're, not -- No. EHRLICHMAN:That's right.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.77PRESIDENT:No. I mean, I'm not going to--HALDEMAN:You grant executive privilege; you say, I amwaiving, executive privilege?EHRLICHMAN:I think you do. PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:I think you do.PRESIDENT:Now Colson disagrees with that one. HALDEMAN:He says you're nuts. PRESIDENT:No. I can say, consistent with him, I cansay definitely, uh, uh -- when you sayexecutive privilege.HALDEMAN:You instructed us to be as forthcoming as wecan.PRESIDENT:Yeah. All the facts that have to do withany of this thing, this thing here, there is no--HALDEMAN:I consider&#8211;PRESIDENT:No. No. HALDEMAN:&#8211;waiving executive privilege. PRESIDENT:Yeah. No. No privilege will be claimedunless it is, uh absolutely necessary orsomething like that, or we'll work, we can work out something.EHRLICHMAN:'Cause that will be the following question,the minute, the minute that you say (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:On all, for me to say that on all matters-that all the matters that relate to thisparticular matter, "Yes--HALDEMAN:That is what I would say, "ExecutivePrivilege is waived."PRESIDENT:I think you've got to say that, Bob.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.78EHRLICHMAN:You could say this. You could say I havenever had a communication with anybody on mystaff...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;about this burglary&#8211;PRESIDENT:Therefore--EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;or about Segretti, prior to-- PRESIDENT:Prior to--Segretti is not in this court sothat's no problem.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think, then I think then--PRESIDENT:I have never had any--I've had-- EHRLICHMAN:Since I had no communication with anybody onthe White House staff about this burglary orabout the circumstances&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;leading up to it&#8211;PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:there is, there is no occasion for executiveprivilege in this matter.PRESIDENT:With regard to this, I want you to get tothe bottom of it. Period. So there will beno executive privilege on that. On other matters--HALDEMAN:And that takes you up to the June 17th--Whatdo you do after June l7th?MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.79PRESIDENT:Use the executive privilege.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible/REMOVED) use questions like,uh, "Did you ever discuss with thePresident, Mr. Haldeman, uh, a matter of executive clemency for any of these uh&#8211;PRESIDENT:Well--EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;uh, defendants?" (Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Both of them say no. HALDEMAN:For, or the payment of money. Or, or, thepayment of, a,--PRESIDENT:Haldeman and Colson would both say no,there's no question.HALDEMAN:Well, since you want to waive privilege sothat we can say no, rather than invoking it, uh&#352;PRESIDENT:You think you can say that? I think you'vegot to say it because basically, uh,basically their situation&#8211;HALDEMAN:Well, Colson would be very disturbed by,that and he must have a reason why he would.PRESIDENT:Well, why don't we get, why don't you gethis arguments so that I can hear it clearly and I will know. What is it, Bob, I mea--and as you recall at the moment, and then Iwill let you go. Colson says don't give anything away that you don't have to, cause you don't know what the hell is going tohappen (unintelligible).MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.80HALDEMAN:His, his thing is don't do any blanketwaiver of privilege, because, because if youget, hit the point where I think you maywant itPRESIDENT:Well, don't use my blanket waiver. Why don'twe just say, uh, uh-- That there's&#352;&#64257;withregard to this"(unintelligible)?HALDEMAN:And then get a John Dean problem. Whatabout all your lawyer/clent privilege?PRESIDENT:Lawyer/client with me? Or with othermembers of the staff?HALDEMAN:Other members of the staff.PRESIDENT:That's a problem. I said that's a matterthat has to be decided on (unintelligible). That looks like it was covered up.HALDEMAN:Ya see, the lawyer/client with other membersof the staff only pertains to his role asyour lawyer and us, our role as your agents.PRESIDENT:Well, be can prepare, we can work some--Ithink we can work something out. John,consider for a moment though, the uh, playthat does not to, to, uh, uh, basically, uh, big big thing. Er incidentally, I got toget this thing--or I would just say, "Theplace that this should be--"EHRLICHMAN:You see the argument that should be made.MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.81PRESIDENT:I know the judge is tough and all that sortof thing. The argument could be made.There's an honest judge. He will get thefacts. The argument could also be made. The prop-- when criminal charges areinvolved, the proper place for those to beconsidered is not in a, not in a kangaroo court in this Congress that drags on an on and on, on television, but in, in a,before a Grand Jury. And indictments,indictments would be heard before a criminal court and under the circumstances(unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Ervin's answer to that will be. &#64257;ThePresident is trying to fight this battle on his battleground. It's obvious that he wantshis FBI, his Justice Department, hisprosecutor&#352;&#64257;PRESIDENT:But not his judge. You see the one, the onestrong point that Rogers had raised, not inthis connection, but Bob, the, the judge isout of this, is the, is the big white knight now.EHRLICHMAN:Okay.PRESIDENT:He's as clean as a hound's tooth. EHRLICHMAN:OK. PRESIDENT:He's as clean as anybody you can find.HALDEMAN:(unintelligible) you ask the judge or directthe judge or request the judge--You can't direct a judge.PRESIDENT:No.HALDEMAN:Request the judge and highly recommend tothe judge that he appoint a special prosecutor.PRESIDENT:That's right. (Noise) (Pause)MARCH 27, 1973 FROM 11:10 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.82HALDEMAN:The President's Justice Department&#8211;PRESIDENT:Let me say&#8211;HALDEMAN:&#8211;or the President's FBI, the President'sspecial prosecutor&#8211;PRESIDENT:&#8211;the same thing is going to happen before aCommission in the long run. Let's face it.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) It's the President, PRESIDENT:They'll have special prosecutors, who'llwant to make a name for himself. Everybodywants to make a name for himself(unintelligible). They'll drag it on and on and on. The idea that a Commission might gothrough the '74 Election and so forth. Myview is I can't. I just think this, that you, John (unintelligible). I think the God damn thing is going to come out anyway and Ithink you better cut the losses now and justbe a little, just better get it over much, frankly, sharper. Perhaps just say, "Alright, judge, let's go."HALDEMAN:Well, come out or not come out, you're notquite committed to this route. You are not necessarily forcing it all to come out.Magruder can stay with his own position ifhe wants to.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).
