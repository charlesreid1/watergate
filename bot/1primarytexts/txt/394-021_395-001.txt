Ithink it's the right thing for him to do,Chuck.COLSON:Uh, he's doing it on my urging. PRESIDENT:Well, I,understand that Haldeman is aftersome kid they've got that -- whether he was-- quit because he wanted him to bug Gary Hart.COLSON:Yeah, that's true. Yeah, he was the onethat bugged McGovern headquarters. Yeah, I suspect so.PRESIDENT:But how could that be, for this reason:Watergate came before McGovern got off theground and I didn't know why the hell we were bugging McGovern.COLSON:Well, remember that was after the Californiaprimary.PRESIDENT:Watergate was? COLSON:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Oh.COLSON:We knew, I mean, at that time(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Hmpff, Christ, I hope he didn't tellMcGovern.COLSON:(Laughs) Well -- PRESIDENT:Well, suppose, I told Haldeman, I said, well"suppose, uh, suppose those in the Congressdoes call him.&#64258; He said, "He didn't do it." You know, nothing. That's the thing about all of this. We didn't get a God-damn thingfrom any of it that I can see.JANUARY 8, 1973, FROM 4:05 TO 5:34 P.M.2COLSON:Well, apparently we did, of course, atWatergate mainly Hughes, and we knew.PRESIDENT:I don't know. (Pause) Well, don't let it getyou down.COLSON:Oh hell no...PRESIDENT:I know it's tough for, uh, for all of you,you, Bob, John, and the rest. We're just notgonna let it get us down. This is a battle,it's a fight, it's war and we just fight witha little, uh, you know, uh remember, uh, we'llcut them down one of these days. Don't youagree?COLSON:I do. I, the only thing I hope is that thetrial -- apparently Liddy is going to go thetrial.UNIDENTIFIED:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Uh, not now.COLSON:That's probably a good thing because the onlyone who's in a, is in a very desparate...PRESIDENT:Sensitive position is Hunt.COLSON:...and, uh, the others will just tell thetruth and prove their case. But there is one advantage to it, there will be a hell of a lotof stuff that's come out.PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:and there will be some counts that will notbe, that will be dropped, I think, againstHunt at this point, and there will be appealspending in the other cases. Now that has got to be (storage count] (Unintelligible). Thatmakes it very, very--PRESIDENT:As long as this trial is going on, theCongress will keep its God-damn cotton-pickin'hands off that trial --COLSON:Well, it could be because obviously they willprejudice the defendants in this connection.You could get a, you could get a -- it, it --JANUARY 8, 1973, FROM 4:05 TO 5:34 P.M.3COLSONa lot of this only comes out, out, this will(Continued)delay the Congress getting to the pointwhere they could even immunize thewitnesses. Uh, a question of prosecuting because of lack of rules of evidence andthat kind of specifics, etc. Uh, and theonly question we have hanging from it at all is the fact that (unintelligible) no Government reports, providing these guys didwhat they, what they, Ehrlichman.PRESIDENT:Well, first of all, they're going to makethe Government prove its case, but none ofthem are going to testify, isn't thatcorrect?COLSON:Correct. PRESIDENT:Are they?SEVERAL VOICES:(Unintelligible) McCord.COLSON:That's another subject McCord(Unintelligible) hanging on to (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) appeal for all these guys.COLSON:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:But you know, Chuck, it's something they allundertook knowing the risks. Right? Whattathey'd think?COLSON:I (unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Did they think they'd get caught?COLSON:No, I don't think that at all, I think theythought that, uh -- well, practically, uh --PRESIDENT:The Democrats would drop it after theelection? No?COLSON:I think they figured that, that these wereall guys who, uh, CIA.PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:And...PRESIDENT:Yeah.JANUARY 8, 1973, FROM 4:05 TO 5:34 P.M.4COLSON:...they all were taking orders from peoplelike (unintelligible) acting on behalf ofJohn Mitchell and others...(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Mitchell would take care of them.(Unintelligible) How could he?COLSON:Yeah. PRESIDENT:No way. COLSON:That's, that's what they were -- Hunt'slawyer, he said he thought he, Hunt,objected to it violently because of the way Liddy handled the job. He said Liddyordered him into Watergate. (Unintelligible)He said he didn't want any part of it. So we won't have to.But, he and Hunt may recognize...PRESIDENT:Well, I'm glad that you [chose the twentyfifth]? (unintelligible) because basically I, uh, question of clemency .... Hunt's is a simple case. I mean, uh, after all, theman's wife is dead, was killed; he's got onechild that has...COLSON:Brain damage from an automobile accident.PRESIDENT:That's right.COLSON:(Unintelligible) one of his kids. PRESIDENT:We'll build, we'll build that son-of-a-bitchup like nobody's business. We'll haveBuckley write a column and say, you know,that he, that he should have clemency, if you've given 18 years of service.COLSON:(Unintelligible). We'll write one.PRESIDENT:That's what we'll do. COLSON:He served under Hunt in CIA, of course.(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:We'll call him after, after. That's that'sit. It's on the merits. I would have difficulty with some of the others.COLSON:Oh, yeah.JANUARY 8, 1973, FROM 4:05 TO 5:34 P.M.5PRESIDENT:You know what I mean.COLSON:Well, the others aren't going to get thesame...Aren't...The vulnerabilities aredifferent with the others also.PRESIDENT:Are they?COLSON:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Why? COLSON:Well because, uh, Hunt and Liddy did thework. The others didn't know anything directthat is (Unintelligible). bankrupt today.PRESIDENT:Uh, well, I think I agree, but you know -- COLSON:See, I don't give a damn if they (laughs)spend five years in jail in the interim.PRESIDENT:Oh, no. COLSON:What I want of course, they took thatattitudePRESIDENT:They took that application because...COLSON:I mean they can't hurt us. Hunt and Liddywere direct guardians of the meetings, discussions are very incriminating for us.More important that they.PRESIDENT:Liddy is pretty tough. COLSON:Yeah, he is, he is, apparently one of theseguys who's a masochist, he, uh, he enjoyspunishing himself. That's okay, as long as he remains stable. I think, he's tough.PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:He's an ideologue, not the kind who(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). Let's not hope by God --COLSON:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Jesus. COLSON:(Unintelligible). Good neal they right wingJANUARY 8, 1973, FROM 4:05 TO 5:34 P.M.6PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).Well, it's the last dayI'm fifty nine. (Unintelligible).(Privileged material delected)PRESIDENT:I wrote a little note to Ed Williams, hisoffer --about his offer to go the game,and that sort of thing, a nice little note.COLSON:What the hell does he want? PRESIDENT:Would you be bugged if I see him? COLSON:No, the guys won't see himHe hasn't setthe, he hasn't set the, uh (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Now, I assume, Chuck -- COLSON:Yeah, he is coming.PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:He wanted, he wanted to come in at 3:30today, uh --PRESIDENT:That's right. I, I thought it would begood.COLSON:And, uh, the chest's open all day long.Chris, Chris said that he got drunk 'cause he was, he was...PRESIDENT:He does look like (unintelligible)of theIrish, remember?COLSON:Yeah, and he was lamenting the fact that heever took the Watergate case out with himbecause he said he missed that -- it ruined his chances of getting appointed to the Supreme Court.PRESIDENT:Well maybe he has a good chance for it.(Pause) Now, you know what I mean?COLSON:That's what he wants.JANUARY 8, 1973, FROM 4:05 TO 5:34 P.M.7PRESIDENT:Well, you could, you could point out, youknow, the fact that, uh, the fact that, uh,if they make a, uh, make some mental notes(unintelligible) what the hell (unintelligible). When you get to Presidentshave always...Bobby Baker, say you want thefacts. (Unintelligible). Let's face it the Johnson (unintelligible). Democratic Party ...and all that, and frankly that, thePresident is sort of puzzled sort of thatthey seem to take the Watergate as a vendatta. It's not -- , I'm not angry youunderstand, because you've got to representthe client. Just was puzzled by it. And they got word that, uh, they got out before (unintelligible) much really happened. Goodget the point?COLSON:That, that, I think that I... PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). COLSON:The thing I'm sure he recognizied is thatthe Watergate matter was completely out ofthis control. That 's his (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:He only gets to the civil side. He can't --there's nothing now that he can do with the Watergate.PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:Uh, and he realizes we've had wild publicityadverse to what the jury (unintelligible) they could indict him. Right?(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) but, uh, let him feelthere's no hard feelings, we don't have hard feelings, but that's the -- we can handlepeople. I, I, I'm a great believer in justbeing, you know --COLSON:He wants to (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:How is he?COLSON:(Unintelligible).JANUARY 8, 1973, FROM 4:05 TO 5:34 P.M.8PRESIDENT:Anyway the point is that, uh, you want to seehim for other -- that, uh, you never know, we&#8482;ve got to play every string we've got here, don't you agree?COLSON:Absolutely. PRESIDENT:Think he's worth seeing?COLSON:(Unintelligible) definitely see him. No problemwith that.PRESIDENT:He is a friend of the, uh,soothsayer...Mitchell.COLSON:Mitchell. PRESIDENT:She signed his letter, you know. That's how wegot the letter, and, uh, it's obvious that, uh,that, uh, he's trying to at least make a -- hold out some sort of a (unintelligible).COLSON:oh, absolutely, absolutely. Because the, theway that really came about is he called, uh me and asked if she could run it over and give it to him. Send it over I told him, I said "Forgetit.&#64258; I said (unintelligible) I don't know whatyou've got. I'm glad I gave it to him. But, I did call him, him back and I said, you know, "Be glad to have you drop by and say hello to people.&#64258; He just said, "Set a time. He couldn't believe that George (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well, we gotta figure it, Chuck (unintelligible)this could go on and on and on (unintelligible) it would be one witness after another.COLSON:I don't think that's important at this time. I'mnot worried about the court proceeding, uh...PRESIDENT:Well, as long as the court proceeding is goingon (unintelligible) by God, Mansfield, theopposition has clearly -- (unintelligible) great, great dangerous for the Congress to get (unintelligible). They cannot -- it it -- Jesus Christ, suppose it's for the communists (unintelligible) everybody else would be jumpingdown the throats of the congress for interferingwith the rights of the, the quote charged but not yet proven guilty individuals.JANUARY 8, 1973, FROM 4:05 TO 5:34 P.M.9COLSON:Look at Ellsberg.PRESIDENT:Look at Manson case. You remember what I saidabout that? Christ, that's a, now what thehell is this? Where is the, where is thesingle standard here, Chuck?COLSON:Well, this is, uh, this is, this is theclassic case of the double standard. Thereisn't been, except for Bill Buckley, onesingle iota of sympathy for these fellows,none at all.PRESIDENT:Well, the point is, too, it isn't just thesympathy the point is, the point is therehasn't been any outrages about whether they're guilty or not, no cry of outrage raised aboutthe Congress meddling in their civil rights.God damn it, the Congress goes forward with aninvestigation while they are still in -- Ithink that's why the court proceeding has itsadvantage. As long as that court proceedingis on, the Congress should keep its God-damnhands off.COLSON:Well -- PRESIDENT:I think some of our guys up there have got todo that, they've got to say that.COLSON:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Or will they?COLSON:No, I think they will. I think, uh, they havebeen relatively silent on this and that's justas well because at this point let's not throwPRESIDENT:Democrats.COLSON:Democrats into the wash here. UhPRESIDENT:Yeah, but Mansfield's not optimum on this.COLSON:Yeah, but that was Watergate written quitesome time ago. (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Oh, was it? Is that so?COLSON:He wrote that letter back in November. Justreleased it. I think the reason he releasedit frankly was to, uh...JANUARY 8, 1973, FROM 4:05 TO 5:34 P.M.10PRESIDENT:Take Teddy off the hook.COLSON:Yeah, take Teddy off the hook, and also, itwas kind of a warning that you'd better havean open trial. And, uh I think the timing of that was, was more, uh, designed, not tolet us think we could get away with beingable to suppress, uh without complications, suppress (unintelligible) because throughout the (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Sweetheart. Yeah.COLSON:That's right. PRESIDENT:(Laughs) unfortunately, unfortunately.We're not that way. Can you imagine the wayJohnson would have handled it?COLSON:Yeah. I can. PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:The U.S. Attorney would, would get off hisfanny (snap fingers) like that or told to. Just take a little tip. (Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). Well, I don't know -- wecan't control that show. I don't -- wecan't get away. (Unintelligible).COLSON:I don't think so.PRESIDENT:No.COLSON:No, the stake will be sort of stalemate. PRESIDENT:That's what it amounts to basically. That'sall Watergate. And incidentally we'llsurvive it.COLSON:Oh, sure. PRESIDENT:I just don't believe that as time goes on --I think people can tire of it too. TheWatergate thing can hang around like ITT and I think you get tired of ITT.COLSON:Terribly, terribly.JANUARY 8, 1973, FROM 4:05 TO 5:34 P.M.11PRESIDENT:You think so?COLSON:Yes, I do. I think they'll develop theWatergate probe on this, unless they get a bigname. If they do that it's a different storyso be it.PRESIDENT:What do you think, if they get big names, thebig name denies it but, that's what happenedin Africa, uh, but you really must be(unintelligible) to fix somebody. That must bevery basically a hearsay proposition all, allup and down the line from what I--. Well, nowyou told me that. I just sensed it, what thehell -- at least Mitchell was that smart. He was close to it but not in it directly.COLSON:No.PRESIDENT:No, they can'tCOLSON:This is perjury.PRESIDENT:Perjury that's a damn hard rap to prove.(Unintelligible).COLSON:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:We did it with Hiss. Well, I'll tell ya, itain't easy. You gotta get it; they haven't got that kind of evidence on Mitchell,Jackies(?) uh, or anybody else. Have they?COLSON:No, I don't think that -- I don't know who thehell -- I keep finding that difficult becausecase on this (unintelligible/REMOVED).PRESIDENT:You fight from (unintelligible). I don't knowwhat to fight.COLSON:No, well, I think if they get to the stagewhere they are volunteering and the Senategets really serious really concerned aboutabout putting them on television. Complicatesthe justice. That's one of the things I getmost concerned with him and that was last weekwas the (unintelligible) agreeing to dropcertain counts of Hunt's indictment inexchange for a guilty plea on three counts.JANUARY 8, 1973, FROM 4:05 TO 5:34 P.M.12PRESIDENT:They did do that?COLSON:Yes, but you see, that precludes him fromtaking jeopardy on two different counts.Therefore, he couldn't refuse to accept congressional immunity(unintelligible)even though it may be given immunity, butthe 5th ammendment says I can't be forced to testify against myself (unintelligible). Iam not questioning they way duty is(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Oh, you fight that right through? COLSON:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And, if necessary you say I want to --COLSON:I mean, Bittman, Bittman's admitting he cantake that one to the Supreme Court.PRESIDENT:You don't want -- a hell of a(unintelligible).COLSON:(Unintelligible) will probably pass enoughtime, so that by then he will have serve his sentence.PRESIDENT:I don't think that's -- I don't know(Unintelligible).COLSON:Teddy's in an awkward position. They way itlooks we can't him. It's hard to figureabout this.PRESIDENT:Oh, did he? COLSON:Yes sir. Yesterday, in the Washington Post(we ran an apartment page)? to go throughthe (unintelligible),just takes a jackhammer to attract.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I've read that one chapter--COLSON:Yeah. Fantastic. I was going to tell youto take that (unintelligible) right now.This gal was under that portrait in theBarbados report.PRESIDENT:He may be destroyed before he gets off theground, Chuck.JANUARY 8, 1973, FROM 4:05 TO 5:34 P.M.13COLSON:Yeah, I think so. I think Dave Kennedy may be(unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:But you see come in in the first chapter.(Unintelligible).COLSON:(Unintelligible) run into it.PRESIDENT:Well, that's what you're doing.(Privileged material deleted) (There is morehere on Sept. 21 clean-up copy).PRESIDENT:Let me tell you, uh, one thing, the, uh, thatyour President is working on (unintelligible)looks good now. (Pause) The Watergate thinggoes too far and we start getting investigatedfor it, we will have to, uh, get out and get everybody's (unintelligible) on it. Uh, theuh, Johnson bugging of the President forexample, last summer. Now you talk aboutbugging the Democratic Committee and failingthat, for example, and bugging a candidate forPresident the last two weeks of thecampaign...COLSON:Or close to it.PRESIDENT:...by the FBI. COLSON:Yeah.PREPSIDFNT:...by the FBI. Deke DeLoach did it. Johnsonbrought him (unintelligible). Deke DeLoachhas told Mitchell and Hoover had told Mitchell(unintelligible). The question is whether ornot Mitchell will say that and whether hebelieved Deke DeLoach (unintelligible) job. Liddy is a former FBI man and he discussedthat with Mark Felt and said I was ready to doit. He said, under oath? Would he mind doingit?COLSON:He worked for John Kennedy.PRESIDENT:Well, I don't mind (unintelligible) but I justsay, just say forget you heard it. But Iheard they're going to play for keeps.COLSON:Well, there's another thing that has to bebrought out too, and that is if we get reallyJANUARY 8, 1973, FROM 4:05 TO 5:34 P.M.14COLSON:in thick, and if the going gets rough in(Continued)Congress -- I don't know whether it will, youknow. The court proceeding is going to run its course, and that's beyond our control ' the country's control. Then I think we've got to prepare, be go all they we are going to be(unintelligible) is floating around. Birch Bayh(unintelligible/REMOVED) security money(unintelligible/REMOVED).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible/REMOVED) can we(unintelligible/REMOVED). Well, I just don'tknow. I just don't know. If we did, why havewe done it before.COLSON:Well, because Clark Mollenoff run a whole serieson Birch Bayh's funding. I think kind of look the other way. The Justice Department -- but those were (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Statute of limitations problem.(Unintelligible). I don't know. But anywaywe've got that on the (unintelligible). I don'tknow how (unintelligible). How do we get such stuff out, (unintelligible).COLSON:With Kennedy, when Kennedy said(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:that I don't know about. But that's one story.COLSON:The point is that the only way that those guys(unintelligible) they really (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:But the point is, but let me, but let me say,having that in mind, would you not agree, though that, that the Johnson thing would indicate to you that the President of the United States(unintelligible) would, uh -- I would franklyhope and wish we could add that half of the problem -- I would like for it to happen. Although maybe it was better that it not happen. Because Johnson, Johnson cannot deny that it happened.COLSON:Just knowing Johnson, I wonder if he actuallysaw the need to call up Marvin Watson and say Marvin you get DeLoach's ass over here and tell him what you want done. (Unintelligible). Regardless, it doens't matter whether it was someone close to Johnson or Johnson.JANUARY 8, 1973, FROM 4:05 TO 5:34 P.M.15PRESIDENT:of course he says he did it because of Vietnamand...All that. But nevertheless, he leave to great deal McGovern noad--his talk S(n with the North Vietnamese, the Terrirists and all that.COLSON:Pierre Salinger or uh -- (Unintelligible).Handed it to the President.PRESIDENT:Close to the election, close to the election but(unintelligible) a hell of a lot though.COLSON:Yeah. PRESIDENT:That's the whole point. COLSON:I was thinking if it came to -- that we couldgive it something. Save of our guys.PRESIDENT:With what kind of an effect -- It would havesome effect on (unintelligible).COLSON:I (unintelligible). PRESIDENT:They would certainly say now (unintelligible).Look here, what the hell are we talking abouthere? (Unintelligible/REMOVED). We would denyon a stack of Bibles that he didn't knowanything about it. And now who the hell isgoing to believe it?COLSON:Nobody. PRESIDENT:Well,we would say it done for politicalpurposes...COLSON:It would be like the January 25th announcementwhen you talked about a whole series of issuesand, and went on, everybody after that including some where a list of questions (unintelligible) mansfield said, well that's what were been urging it on the President all the time (unintelligible) he says it is (unintelligible).And your answer would be, I'll let the courtproceeding go ahead (unintelligible) and now that, now that you're not satified with justice (unintelligible) and meet with...PRESIDENT:Right. COLSON:Let's call a spade a spade. Somebody had todeal with it. Deke would, uh, do it. He woulddo anything.
