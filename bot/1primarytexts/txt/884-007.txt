Just got,just at least our own friends have got to have a feeling that everything is okay. You understand?HALDEMAN:Maybe their people will put out a statement.PRESIDENT:I've worked out (unintelliqible) after, ah,according to Dean and Moore and, ah, they'vetalked to, they've talked to Chapin and, ah,to Strachan.
