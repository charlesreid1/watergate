IN THE EOB OFFICE.**********PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Incidentally, uh, Haldemanwas telling, uh, told me that that, uh, apparently that Hunt is going to, uh, (unintelligible) now--very definitely. Ithink it's the right thing for him to do,Chuck.COLSON:Uh, he's doing it on my urging.PRESIDENT:Well, I understand that Haldeman is aftersome kid they've got that--whether he was-- (unintelligible) that bugged Gary Hart?COLSON:Yeah, that's true. Yeah, the one thatbugged McGovern headquarters. Yeah, Isuspect so.PRESIDENT:But how could that be, for this reason:Watergate came before McGovern got off theground and I didn't know why the hell webugged McGovern.COLSON:Well, remember that was after the Californiaprimary.PRESIDENT:Watergate was? COLSON:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Oh.COLSON:We knew, I mean, at that time(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Hmpff, Christ, I hope he didn't talk to(unintelligible).COLSON:(Laughs) Well-- PRESIDENT:Well, suppose, I told Haldeman, I said, "Bobsuppose, uh, suppose those in the, Congressdoes call him." He said, "He didn't do it."You know, nothing. That's the thing about all of this. We didn't get a God-damn thingfrom any of it that I can see.COLSON:Well, frankly they did, of course, but then,ah what they mainly used ma--we knew.PRESIDENT:(Pause) Well, don't let it get you down.COLSON:Oh hell no... PRESIDENT:I know it's tough for, uh, for all of you,Bob, John and the rest. We're just notgonna let it get us down. This is a battle, it's a fight, it's war and we just fightwith a little, uh, you know, uh remember,uh, we'll cut them down one of these days. Don't you agree?COLSON:I do. I, the only thing I hope is that thetrial-- apparently Liddy is going to go totrial.PRESIDENT:McCord?COLSON:No. Not now. That's probably a good thingbecause the only one who's in a, is a very desperate...PRESIDENT:Sensitive position is Hunt.COLSON:...and, uh, the others will just tell thetruth and prove their case. But there is one advantage to it, there'll be a hell of a lot of stuff that'll come out...PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:...and there will be some counts that willnot be, that will be dropped, I think,against Hunt at this point, and there willbe appeals pending in the other cases. Now that (unintelligible) guts of the story (unintelligible) come out (unintelligible)makes it very, very--PRESIDENT:As long as this trial is going on, theCongress will keep its God-damn cotton-pickin' hands off that trial--COLSON:Well, it could be because obviously theywill prejudice the defendants in this connection. You could get a, you could geta--it, it--a lot of this only comes up--Uh,this will delay the Congress getting to the point where they believe in immunizingwitnesses. Uh, a question of prosecutingbecause of lack of rules of evidence and(unintelligible) get into the specifics Uh,and the only question we have hanging(unintelligible) no Government reports, providing these guys (unintelligible) Ehrlichman.PRESIDENT:Well, first of all, they're going to makethe Government prove its case, but none of them are going to testify, isn't thatcorrect?COLSON:That's correct. PRESIDENT:Are they? SEVERAL(Unintelligible) McCord.VOICES:COLSON:That's another subject McCord(unintelligible) hanging on to(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) appeal for all these guys. COLSON:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:But you know, Chuck, it's something they allunder-took knowing the risks. Right?Whatta they think?COLSON:I (unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Did they think they'd get caught?COLSON:No, I don't think that at all, I think theythought that, uh--well, practically, uh--PRESIDENT:The Democratizes would drop it after theelection? No?COLSON:I think they figured that, that these wereall guys who, uh, CIAPRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:AndPRESIDENT:Yeah. COLSON:they all were taking orders from people like(unintelligible) acting on behalf of JohnMitchell and others ...(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Mitchell would take care of them.(Unintelligible) How could he?COLSON:Yeah.PRESIDENT:No way.COLSON:That's, that's what they were--Hunt'slawyer, he said he thought he, Hunt, objected to it violently. He said Liddy is kind of dumb. He said he didn't want anypart of it. (Unintelligible) so we won'thave two. But, he and Hunt recognize...PRESIDENT:Well, I'm glad that you (unintelligible)them because basically I, uh, question ofclemency... Hunt's is a simple case. I mean, uh, after all, the man's wife is dead, was killed; he's got one child that has...COLSON:Brain damage from an automobile accident.PRESIDENT:That's right. COLSON:(Unintelligible) one of his kids.PRESIDENT:We'll build, we'll build that son-of-a-bitchup like nobody's business. We'll have Buckley write a column and say, you know, that he, that he should have clemency, ifyou've given 18 years of service.COLSON:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:That's what we'll do. COLSON:He served under Hunt in CIA, of course.(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:We'll (unintelligible) them after. That's,that's it. It's on the merits. I wouldhave difficulty with some of the others.COLSON:Oh, yeah. PRESIDENT:You know what I mean. COLSON:Well, the others aren't going to get thesame Area`s... The vulnerabilities aredifficult (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Are they?COLSON:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Why? COLSON:Well because, uh, Hunt and Liddy did thework. The others didn't know any, directinformation (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Uh, well, I think I agree.COLSON:See, I don't give a damn if they spend fiveyears in jail (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Oh, no. COLSON:What I'm watching closely... PRESIDENT:I think that application because...COLSON:They can't hurt us. Hunt and Liddy: direct(unintelligible), meetings, discussions are very incriminating to us. More importantthat those.PRESIDENT:Liddy is pretty tough. COLSON:Yeah, he is, he is, apparently one of theseguys who's a masochist, he, uh, he enjoyspunishing himself. That's okay, as long ashe remains stable. I mean, he's tough.PRESIDENT:Yeah.COLSON:He denied even (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Oh, my God' COLSON:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Jesus.COLSON:They're both good healthy right-wingexuberants.PRESIDENT:Well, this is the last damn fifty miles. **********
