PRESIDENT:he wouldn't get a surprise.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Naturally, he can't believe it so that'sthat.HALDEMAN:Well, I canPRESIDENT:It's one of those things.HALDEMAN:It's hard to believe, but it's uh, PRESIDENT:One thing that occurs to me, Bob, is thisand as I reflect a little on Magruder'sstuff.HALDEMAN:Um, huh. PRESIDENT:I'll be damned if I don't think that some 'of that could be, you know, uh, uh,exaggerated but I, I just don't knowHALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:I, I don't know, I can't tell. He's uh, he'sbeen so, he's uh, he's uh, obviouslyflailing around like a wild man at the present time, butAPRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M. HALDEMAN:No, no, he's not really. I think I, I thinkhe was earlier trying and er--, he was frantic but once, once he figured out wherehe was going I think, I think he'sPRESIDENT:He thinks that this is what he remembersnow.HALDEMAN:Yep. Um, huh.PRESIDENT:But he could not HALDEMAN:He does. PRESIDENT:I'm sure that his interpretations on variousthings are to be tr--, I mean to beinterpreted either way, you know, like hisinterpretation on Dean, his interpretationon, on Strachan, for example.HALDEMAN:Yep, yep. PRESIDENT:Certainly isHALDEMAN:That's right and invar-PRESIDENT:I don't, I just don't know how it's gonnacome out, though, that's the whole point andIHALDEMAN:I just PRESIDENT:...I just don't know as I, when I wasserious when I said to John, uh, at the endthere I says God damn it, all these guysthat p--, participated in raising the money and so forth have got to stick to their linethat they did not raise this money toobstruct justice.3APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.HALDEMAN:Well, I sure didn't think they were.PRESIDENT:Hmm? HALDEMAN:I didn't think they were and I don't thinkthey did.PRESIDENT:Well HALDEMAN:With maybe some exceptions.PRESIDENT:Right, right, of course, they will if they,I suppose there they will say that, uh, I mean, uh, uh, uh, I me--, like, like, Like Mc Cord has said it was the purpose, thatwas the purpose but that Dean-that somebodytold him that, and that so that didn't mean anything.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And the question, of course, is there, isLiddy and, and, Um, the others, butHALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...We shall see. You know it's the word ofthe, of the felons against the word of the men that raised the money, huh?HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:And, um(Pause)HALDEMAN:Well, you just, 'cause you, you don't knowhow much will come what way either, I meanthat4 APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.PRESIDENT:Now we, we have, uh HALDEMAN:We could get (unintelligible) PRESIDENT:At least, at least I think, I think (laughs)now we pretty much know what the worst is I,I do I don It know what the hell else they could have that's any worse, you know what I mean, unless -you knowHALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Unless there's, and I mean, I don't knowthat uh, unless somebody's got, uh, somepiece of paper that somebody signed or some God damned thing butHALDEMAN:WellPRESIDENT:...that I doubt.HALDEMAN:Doesn't appear that there is such a thing.(pause) I mean, there's been no hint ofthat, what's in here is, is all stuff that,that, uh, has been hinted at. It goes further than, than what was, uh, found in some areas but it's, obviously it's totallyconsistent basically with what everythingJohn had developed.PRESIDENT:Let me ask you this. I wonder if if isn'tnot only fair but in our interest, uh, foreither you or John, now not going into too much detail, to fill him in on Magruder. I mean, having in mind, uh, could Colson, uhcould, uhHALDEMAN:I told Ehrlichman 5 APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.PRESIDENT:Colson. And, uh, I mean, we have nointerest, you know what I mean, in getting his ass up there, you know, uh, uh, guiltyon a perjury charge.HALDEMAN:Um, huh. 'Course there'-s nothing Jeb saidthat's inconsistent with anything that Chuck has said.PRESIDENT:Oh. Could be right. Chuck could say yes,the Liddy project, sure, but I thought the Liddy project was something else.HALDEMAN:That's right. That's what he -does say.PRESIDENT:He does, huh? HALDEMAN:Yeah, and, and as, uh, Ehrlichman said and,and under questioning they specific, ah, uh,specifically said that he didn't get intothe, uh, you know, any specifics on it and they had nothing that hits him on anyspecifics. And, I think he's probably clearon them.PRESIDENT:I think he believes that, Bob, I mean, IknowHALDEMAN:I do, too. PRESIDENT:I think he believes that, butHALDEMAN:I've felt that all along.(Pause)PRESIDENT:Well, we'll sleep on the God damned thingand6 APRIL 14,1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Uh, what's the situation tomorrow? IsEhrlichman gonna, uh, sit down with Ziegler again or something?HALDEMAN:YeahPRESIDENT:I, I do think that, PR thing and, and we'vegot to sort of, sort of make up our minds on what the hell Ehrlich&#8211;HALDEMAN:Get at that, I want to get at, get in astatement done.HALDEMAN:And we again, we got to get at, just sort ofmake this decision with regard to this Goddamned committee. I, I, I don't know.HALDEMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:And I'm, I, I still, I still have, uh, mixedemotions on it, I don't know, I don't know,I've (sigh) I've, I've been one way one time, one way another.HALDEMAN:Well, it's a, it's a mixed bag. It has, haspluses and minuses and I, it's hard to besure, which out weigh the other.PRESIDENT:one way, scenario would be, simply say theywill all come up on, every body will come upin Executive Session, including Dean, just say that, and make that offer and that's flat.APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.HALDEMAN:Yeah, and that gets turned down and thenwe're standing on the question of --the way it will be played is not that the Committee is being unreasonable by insisting ontelevision but that we're being unreasonableby insisting against it.PRESIDENT:Well it, that would be true unless you got,and hammered that the whole record could bemade public.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:It's only that we don't--we wantinformation, not a show.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:And, uh, that we think it should be.HALDEMAN:The question, the question then is you losesomething, obviously by doing that, and that do we really gain enough to make it worth it? How bad is it if we go on television?PRESIDENT:(Sigh).HALDEMAN:I'm not at all sure it's all that bad. Inthe first place, it's gonna be in the daytime. The second place, as of now, it'snot going to be carried live by thenetworks.PRESIDENT:Yeah.8APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.HALDEMAN:Now it might be, but I would guess it won'tbe. After this other stuff breaks, it isn'tgoing to be that important anymore. The networks don't want to carry it. It costs them money. What will probably end up happeningis it will be, it will be carried on thepublic broad castingPRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...which has virtually no audiencein thedaytime.PRESIDENT:Um, huh. HALDEMAN:Virtually no audiencePRESIDENT:I suppose what happens there is that thatevery new break then is carried for fiveminutes or ten in the evening news.HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:That's the point.HALDEMAN:That's right. It's going to be carriedanyway it's a question whether it's carried with, with, uh, for five minutes with one ofus on camera for a couple of those minutesor whether it's carried for three minutes with uhPRESIDENT:Weicker.HALDEMAN:...with Weicker and John Chancellor orDan Rather.PRESIDENT:Yeah.9APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.HALDEMAN:Saying--you know PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...trembling with fear and obviously tryingto hide the truth, uh,...PRESIDENT:I wonder if you would HALDEMAN:...soPRESIDENT:...uh, would do this, uh, did you, did youdiscuss the public or private thing with m--, two people whose judgement is, Rogersand, uh, and, and Connally. What didConnally think--public?HALDEMAN:I, I'm not sure. PRESIDENT:Would you mind, uhHALDEMAN:I'd have to reopen that.PRESIDENT:Would it be alright for you to call him andask him?HALDEMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:I wish you would tomorrow and say, look, wejust got to make a command decision on this.HALDEMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:And I think you should tell, do you thinkyou should tell him about, uh, Magruder?HALDEMAN:Nope. APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.PRESIDENT:No, I guess not.HALDEMAN:I, I can say the whole thing looks like it'scoming to, uh,PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...to aPRESIDENT:It's gonna HALDEMAN:conclusion PRESIDENT:...before the Grand Jury.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:Without saying any specific.PRESIDENT:Right. Now the, uh, the other point--fellowwhose judgement would be pretty good, Bob, would be Bill Rogers on that.HALDEMAN:Yep. I agree.PRESIDENT:And, um, I wish you'd give him a call.HALDEMAN:Alright. PRESIDENT:Um huh. HALDEMAN:I will.PRESIDENT:I think what Bill, will, you, you, couldtell him, don't you think?APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.HALDEMAN:Nope. I don It, I don't think I should. Inthe first place, I'm not supposed to know.PRESIDENT:Well, this, this isn't from the Grand Jury,Bob.HALDEMAN:No, I know, but, uh, Kleindienst is worriedabout, uh, John giving the information to anybody and IPRESIDENT:I see. You're right.HALDEMAN:I don't see anything to be gained fromtelling him anyway.PRESIDENT:But you can tell him that, uh, ourinvestigations indicate that this, uh, GrandJury is, is hot on the trail of breaking the thing now.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And it's go--, and that's, uh, the way it'sgonna come, that, but, uh, but if you wouldn't mind giving a call in the morningto both thoseHALDEMAN:Okay. PRESIDENT:fellows and tell them that I, this is,you're calling for the President,HALDEMAN:Okay.PRESIDENT:that he'd like to have their consideredjudgement, should you be on television ornot on television.12 APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.HALDEMAN: Right. Will do. PRESIDENT: And, um, and it may be on the Dean thing.I'm almost inclined to think we ought to give on that. What do you think? (laugh)The idea of backing down, we,, uh, they'regonna think we've backed down anyway so what's the difference.HALDEMAN: That has never bothered me and that, I, Iguess I'm wrong on it because it sure bothers other people.PRESIDENT: It bothers Ziegler and the rest, butHALDEMAN: I think we gain more by backing down than welose.PRESIDENT:Yes, just say because ofHALDEMAN: I don't, I don't think you have any problemof being associatedPRESIDENT:...You, just that by all this HALDEMAN:been in enough battles anyway.PRESIDENT:by all this, by all, because of all of thesecharges that have been around, these men areentitled to be heard in public.HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:And I want them heard in public and I wantthem to tell their story in public. I'm almost convinced that that's what we oughtto do with the whole damn bunch and13 APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.PRESIDENT: not try to stand on the Dean thing and therest. Humph, get a settlement that way. Well, that's my present view, Bob, and wecan go on it. Uh, point, another point, uh,you, you will, you, you do, it's no one person you do tell, tell, and I uh, he canstill say you, that he just told him to tellthe truth, uh, you ought to tell Strachan but tell himHALDEMAN: John's gonna tePRESIDENT:...John is--but not in a way thatStrachan indicates that he knows what the other fellow is saying.HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Strachan's smart enough to do that.HALDEMAN:Yep. PRESIDENT:So that he's got to be prepared that he'sgonna be asked this and he's gonna be askedthat. John should just put him through a little wringer there.HALDEMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:Well, John is the one that should do it.He's conducting an invest igation for the President.HALDEMAN:Well, and he's got the information, I don't.PRESIDENT:Um, huh. HALDEMAN:But I can reconstruct.14APRIL 14, 1973 FROM 11:02 TO 11:16 P.M.PRESIDENT: No, that's right, I agree, but John willknow the question toHALDEMAN: Specific points is what he heeds to cover.PRESIDENT: Um, huh. That's good. That's good. Wellyou know the point (laugh) ratherinteresting to me tonight that, uh, you knowwhen you really think of what the hell, here we are, whole, it's really quite true. Enough about it without being melodramatic.The hopes for peace in this damn world dodepend on this office right now in the next four years and, God damn it, we've got to,we've got to be sure that uh, that isn'tcompromised by anything that, you know, that indicates any lack of confidence in the President. Isn't that what it gets down to?HALDEMAN: YepPRESIDENT: That's why I think this is sort of a cheapprice to pay, you know what I, mean, and, uh, on that point.HALDEMAN: That's exactly right.
