HALDEMAN:...one group thesis...PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.2HALDEMAN:...that, uh, Reston...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...Reston has on that side and point out(tape noise).

And I don't...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...I don't think it's a speech.PRESIDENT:Well, that's the point. I think it&#8482;s-there're other ways you can get at it. Now, I was thinking of the, uh -before weget into that though, let's get back -that'ssomething we can get into later -I'd like to get -I'd like to go in, if I could, to what your conversation with Colson was and, uh,in essence. What, what was yours, what didhe and the lawyer come to tell you about?HALDEMAN:Hunt's visit.EHRLICHMAN:That visit was to tell me that Hunt wasgoing to testify on Monday afternoon.PRESIDENT:How does he know that? HALDEMAN:um hmm.PRESIDENT:How does, how does he get such information?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.3EHRLICHMAN:Uh, undoubtedly through Bittman.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:Or Bittman through Shapiro.PRESIDENT:Now why, why is Hunt testifying? Did he say?Or, uh, what...EHRLICHMAN:He didn't say.PRESIDENT:...(unintelligible) about the -- EHRLICHMAN:He said -I'll tell you what he said and thenI'll tell you what I think the fact is -hesaid Hunt was testifying because there wasno longer any point in being silent. That, uh, uh, so many other people were testifyingthat there was no -he wasn't really keepingany secrets.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Couldn't add much. Uh, my, my feeling isthat Bittman got very antsy when this grandjury started focusing on the aftermath...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) know what was involved HALDEMAN:That's it exactly.EHRLICHMAN:and that he went to the U.S. Attorney andhe said, "Maybe I can persuade my client to talk."PRESIDENT:What does, uh, what do Colson, et al, Colsonand Shapiro think we ought to do under these circumstances? Get busy and nail Wilson and, uh, nail Mitchell in a hurry? Is thatwhat he means?EHRLICHMAN:Yes. PRESIDENT:How is that going to help?EHRLICHMAN:Well, they feel that...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I just want to get the besteffort.EHRLICHMAN:...they feel that after Hunt testifies thatthe whole thing's going to fall in, in shortorder.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.4PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:That Mitchell and, uh, Magruder willinvoluntarily be, uh, uh, indictedPRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) say...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...that you have lost any possibly ofinitiative, so -for participation...PRESIDENT:So, what does ColsonEHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...want us to do? EHRLICHMAN:He wants you to do several things. He wantsyou to persuade Liddy to talk.PRESIDENT:Me? EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. That's his -I didn't bring mynotes, but basically --PRESIDENT:Oh. Last night you didn't mention this,,butthat's alright.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, I thought I had. PRESIDENT:Maybe you did, maybe you did.EHRLICHMAN:-I didn't, I didn't...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:in any event, he didn'tPRESIDENT:I would bring, he-, le-, let Liddy in andtell him to talk?EHRLICHMAN:You can't bring him in. He's in jail. But,uhPRESIDENT:Oh.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.5EHRLICHMAN:You would send, you'd send word to him, andof course wanting him to make fulldisclosure or in some way you would beactivist on this score.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:There's no, there's -that isn't -doesn'tinvolve any real problem. As Dean points out, uh, Liddy is not talking 'cause he thinks he's supposed not to talk. If he issupposed to talk, he will. All he needs isa signal, if you want to turn Liddy up.PRESIDENT:Yeah, oh -yeah. But the point that...HALDEMAN:Face it, he believes --PRESIDENT:...Colson wants is a public signal. Is thatright?HALDEMAN:No, he (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:A public signal (unintelligible) what thehell do you do?EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) he wants to be able to -hewants you to be able to, to say afterwardthat you cracked the case.PRESIDENT:Go ahead. What else? EHRLICHMAN:Well, I forget what else. Do you remember,Bob? Uh, uhHALDEMAN:Well, that was basically (unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:Basically, basically, uh, he, he feels thatthe next forty-eight hours are the, are thelast chancePRESIDENT:Mmm-huh. EHRLICHMAN:...for the White House to get out in frontof this and that once Hunt goes on, thenthat's the ball game.PRESIDENT:But you've got to be out in front earlier. EHRLICHMAN:Well--APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.6PRESIDENT:But, I mean, sorry, not earlier, butpublicly.EHRLICHMAN:Uh. either...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:...either publicly or with provable,identifiable steps which can be referred tolater as having been the proximate cause.PRESIDENT:He's just not talking because he thinks thePresident doesn't want him to talk? Is thatthe point?EHRLICHMAN:He's -according to them... PRESIDENT:(Noise)... Mitchell... (Noise)Mitchell's given him a promise of a pardon(tape noise) Bittman?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, uh, no, according to, uh, uh, Colsonand Shapiro. And I don't know where theyget that.PRESIDENT:Mitchell has promised Liddy a pardon? EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. Other points that Colson may nothave mentioned, uh, uh, -(tape noise)PRESIDENT:Ihave an uneasy feeling that, thatMagruder story may have been planted.HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:Or is it true?HALDEMAN:There, there's a third Magruder phone callwhich I haven't heard that, uh, uh, says...PRESIDENT:Says he did talk to the press?HALDEMAN:...says he did talk to a reporter on Monday&#352;did not say any of the things he's, he's reported to have said, that what he, that-he said it wasn't an importantconversation. He said the same -he gave the reporter the same line.PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.7HALDEMAN:That, you know -but in listening toMagruder's thing...PRESIDENT:Alright.HALDEMAN:...I was convinced he wasn't completelytelling the truth that he -in what he wassaying. As you get into it, I'm convincedthat his (unintelligible) that part was pretty much...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Uh, but you come to this -all these piecesmust be put together now. But you come toMagruder, uh, where the hell does Colson getsuch a thing?. Uh, or is Colson a liar or --EHRLICHMAN:Shapiro, Shapiro says he has a very goodpress contact who has proved very reliableto him and he says his, his practice in this town depends on his knowing what's going on. And he's (un intelligible) press contact.This is one of the -and he's always found itto be -PRESIDENT:He says that he's talked to Magruder andMagruder said that, that -?HALDEMAN:Yeah. What they've now told us is we'llnever .get the transcript. That hePRESIDENT:Magruder, think Magruder may have done this?EHRLICHMAN:I think Magruder may have talked, talked tosomebody in the press and that, that was...SEVERAL VOICES:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:But, but in the great detail that Colsonwent into, that he nailed Bob Haldeman, I mean the way Colson did, he says he, he had Colson in the tubeEHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...but, but not in any way that wasparticularly, ah, bad. Right?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.8EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think, I think like so many thingsthis got, this got planted as a little seedby Shapiro with Colson and that it grew and,uh, uh, uhPRESIDENT:Oh yeah?EHRLICHMAN:Uh-huh. I'd, I'd justHALDEMAN:I would guess what's happened is he's gotthis report from -Colson does -from Danny Hofgren that at the bar in the Bahamas with(unintelligible) or something (tape noise)one night said to Hofgren, "Jesus, everybody was involved in this." He didn't use thePRESIDENT:Uh hmm.EHRLICHMAN:Everybody knew about it. HALDEMAN:Mitchell, Haldeman, Colson, Dean, thePresidentPRESIDENT:Magruder...HALDEMAN:He, he specifically said the President. PRESIDENT:...Magruder doesn't It believe that, though,does he?HALDEMAN:No. Ya know, I've got it, I've got...SEVERAL VOICES: (Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:I just wonder if he believes it. I'mcurious because -do you think he believesit, John?EHRLICHMAN:No. This tape's very convincing and Higbyhandled it so well that Magruder has closedall those doors now, with this tape.PRESIDENT:What good will that do, John?(Tape noise)EHRLICHMAN:Uh, sir, it beats the socks off him if heever gets off the reservation.PRESIDENT:Can you use the tape? EHRLICHMAN:Well, no. You can use Higby.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.9HALDEMAN:Why can't you use the tape?PRESIDENT: WellEHRLICHMAN:It's an illegal tape.HALDEMAN:No, it's not. EHRLICHMAN: Yeah.HALDEMAN:It is not.PRESIDENT:That you tell somebody HALDEMAN:No, sir. EHRLICHMAN:No beeper on it.HALDEMAN:There is no beeper required. You check theWashington law.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:District of Columbia is under federal lawand the federal law does not require disclosure to the other party of the recording of phone conversations. The phonecall was made to Magruder's lawyer's officewhich is also in the District of Columbia so both ends of the conversation were in the District of Columbia and there is no lawrequiring disclosure.EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's interesting. HALDEMAN:It's perfectly legal.PRESIDENT:Well, anyway, anywayHALDEMAN:it cannot be admissible, but it's legal. PRESIDENT:That's interesting. That's a new one.(Unintelligible) beep every, every whilethen, now and then. I thought it was.However, I never heard anybody beepin', and hell-didn't you?HALDEMAN:No. It all depends on where you are. Some-the basic law in most States is that you must disclose to the other party that you're recording the conversation.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.10PRESIDENT:Yeah. What is the situation -I might -I'llget past this in a hurry -what is thesituation, John, in your opinion on what wasColson's and/or Shapiro's motive in building up the Magruder story? Maybe they believeit.EHRLICHMAN:Their, their innuendo is that, that Mitchellhas put Magruder up to this.PRESIDENT:I guess not. Okay. There's the motive.Now, let me come to something else.HALDEMAN:I don't believe that Magruder's PRESIDENT:I don't either. Not at all.HALDEMAN:I don't believe Mitchell has tried toPRESIDENT:Huh? HALDEMAN:I don't believe Mitchell tried to Magruder'sfaith 'cause he refers to Mitchell and nowthat I have decided to talk I am going totell Mr. Mitchell and he's gonna be very unhappy with me 'cause he's told me not to.PRESIDENT:-(Unintelligible) tape, uh --HALDEMAN:I didPRESIDENT:And he's an emotional fellow who's ready tocrack.EHRLICHMAN:I, I really, I have no doubt that he's readyto talk.PRESIDENT:What is he -he hasn't been subpoenaed yet,has he?EHRLICHMAN:Well, he won't be. But he's already beenthere.SEVERAL VOICES:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Dean doesn't think they'll give him a, achance back unless he comes running at them and just and, uh, spills it.HALDEMAN:'Cause (A) they don't call the suspects and(B) they don't recall perjury witnesses.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.11PRESIDENT:Right. What would you do if you were hislawyer? Wouldn't you advise him to go in andtry and purge himself, at least -get rid ofone charge, doesn't he?EHRLICHMAN:I'm not sure he's rid of it, but itcertainly reduces it when he comes involuntarily.PRESIDENT:The way I understand it under the law, John,if he were to come to the...EHRLICHMAN:But he's hooked.PRESIDENT:...Grand Jury. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, but he's hooked, see. There'scontrary evidence already...PRESIDENT:Oh, I see. EHRLICHMAN:...before the Grand Jury. PRESIDENT:In other wordsEHRLICHMAN:If he did thatPRESIDENT:Strachan -Strachan got in before there was(unintelligible) evidence.EHRLICHMAN:Exactly,HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Strachan? HALDEMAN:No, (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...Magruder. EHRLICHMAN:And, and you take the circumstances, now PRESIDENT:They better haveEHRLICHMAN:Yeah. If it's known, if it's known, forinstance, that Hunt is going to come in and testify, then Magruder comes rushing in andsays I want to tell all, it's, uh, you know-PRESIDENT:Magruder's stuck on both counts.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.12EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, but I think he could improve it. Ithink he, he really could help to purgehimself.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). I've come to the -may Icome to the other things that, uh, that you,uh, you talked to Colson about, uh? Huntgoing to talk -what is Hunt going to say? Do we have any idea?EHRLICHMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:He says, for example, will he say thatColson promised him clemency?EHRLICHMAN:No. Apparently not.PRESIDENT:And, uh, you see the, the only, the onlypossible involvement of the President in this is that. Now apparently, John, either you or Bob or Dean, somebody told me theysaid Cols-, told Colson not to discuss itwith me.EHRLICHMAN:I did. PRESIDENT:You did. How did, bar-, how did it get toyou then, John? How did you know that the,the matter had to be discussed with Bittman or something like that?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I...PRESIDENT:When did this happen? EHRLICHMAN:I had... PRESIDENT:I remember a conversation this day, it wasabout five thirty or six o'clock, thatColson only dropped it in sort of parenthetically. He said, "I had a littleproblem today," -and we were talking aboutthe defendants-and I said, I sought to reassure him, you know, and so forth. And I said, "Well, that's-told me about Hunt'swife -he said, "It's a terrible thing," andI said, "Obviously we'll do just, we will take that into consideration.&#64258; And that wasthe total of the conversation.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.13EHRLICHMAN:Well, I had, uh, we had had a couple of conversations in my office --PRESIDENT:With Colson? EHRLICHMAN:With, or, I had with Colson. Yeah. PRESIDENT:Well, how was... EHRLICHMAN:And I, uh --PRESIDENT:...who was getting, who was, Was Bittman getting to Colson?, Was that the point? Who, whoEHRLICHMAN:Now Hunt, Hunt had written to Colson. PRESIDENT:Oh? EHRLICHMAN:Hunt wrote Colson a very I've-been-abandonedkind of letter.PRESIDENT:Yeah. When was this, John?EHRLICHMAN:I am sorry, I PRESIDENT:After the election? EHRLICHMAN:Oh, yes. Yeah. PRESIDENT:Oh, and Chuck Colson -you knew about thisletter?EHRLICHMAN:Colson come in to tell me about it. And hesaid, "What shall I do?&#64258; And I said, "Well, uh,better talk to him, I think somebody'd better talk to him -the guy is obviously very distraught...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...and, uh, feeling abandoned."PRESIDENT:Right. Good advice.EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, he said, "Well, what can, what can Itell him about, uh, clemency or pardon?&#64258; And I said, "You can't tell him anything about clemency or a pardon." And I said, "Under no circumstances should this ever be raised withthe President."PRESIDENT:Yeah. Told him not to raise it with me. Well,he raised it, I-must say, in a tangential way. Now he denies that, as I understand it, that he said that he'd be out by Christmas. He says --APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.14EHRLICHMAN:I never, I've never talked to Chuck aboutthat, have you.HALDEMAN(?) Yes and no.PRESIDENT:What did he say he said?Well, I'll tell you what I, what Dean, orsomebody tells me he said he said. He saidthat he didn't I t -he just talked to, saw, saw Bittman casually, or on the phone or something of that sort.EHRLICHMAN:Bittman?PRESIDENT:That was it. EHRLICHMAN:Oh.PRESIDENT:And he said to BittmanEHRLICHMAN:oh. PRESIDENT:...he said, "I," he said, "I EHRLICHMAN:Well, now that...PRESIDENT:...he said, "I...EHRLICHMAN:...a difference. PRESIDENT:Listen, I have written it. He said, "I, uh,I, uh, I, I know that, uh, I know aboutHunt's concern about clemency. I, ChuckColson, feel terrible about it, 'cause I knew his wife." And, uh, he said, "I will,will go to bat for him and I have reason tobelieve that my views would be, ah, listened to.&#64258; Well it's the last part, part that, uh, might in any way remain, although...EHRLICHMAN:He says he talked to Bittman and that he wasvery skillful...PRESIDENT:That's right.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.15EHRLICHMAN:...in avoiding any commitment. He saysBittman...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:...Bittmanwas pitching 'em, but that hewasn't catching 'em. And...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:...he either has a tape of that meeting or atape of the conversation or some such thing.HALDEMAN:That's where he lost his thread, then. Yes,said you and Dean told him you, two promisedclemency, and that he was smarter than you and, and didn't.PRESIDENT:You haven't said you and Dean promised?HALDEMAN:-That Ehrlichman and Dean told him topromise...PRESIDENT:Shit.HALDEMAN:...(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well, anyway, whatever the case might be,uh, let me ask a question...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)a little strange.PRESIDENT:...does, does Hunt -well, just so that he,uh -does he, does, does, does he indicate that they, that Hu-, Hunt's going to talk tothat subject for example -the promise ofclemency?EHRLICHMAN:Uh, he didn't say that. He didn't say that.I didn't ask him.HALDEMAN:Well, going back to the basis, John -as Irecall, they don't have anything to indi we don't know how they know Hunt's going totestify. We assume that Bittman toldthem...EHRLICHMAN:Right.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.16HALDEMAN:...(A). (B) we don't, they don't have anyindication, based on their knowledge thatHunt's going to testify, of what Hunt isgoing to testify to, except on the basis of Shapiro's meeting with Hunt...EHRLICHMAN:The other day.HALDEMAN:...the other day. And they're assuming thatwhat Hunt told Shapiro is what he will tell the Grand Jury, but I don't know why they'dhave any reason to assume that.EHRLICHMAN:I don't, uh, uh, -Shapiro's general commentwas that Hunt would corroborate a lot ofMcCord's hearsayPRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...but that it also would be hearsay. PRESIDENT:Alright. Hunt, however, and this is whereColson comes in, right? Hard. Hunt couldtestify on Colson's pressure.HALDEMAN:Yeah. But what they, what they've said he'sgonna testPRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...on the coverup, what he is gonnatestify...PRESIDENT:Now wait a minuteHALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:...I'm talking about something entirelydifferent...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:...you're talking about when Colson... HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...Colson and Liddy were in the office andColson, Colson picked up the phone and called Magruder.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.17HALDEMAN:That's right. Sure.PRESIDENT:Now, there, uh, now Colson says that, uh,that they didn't discuss bugging at thatpoint. Hunt could say, "I went in and I showed this whole plan to Colson and Colsonphoned -picked up the phone...EHRLICHMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:...and talked to Magruder." EHRLICHMANTrue.PRESIDENT:...does, does, does, does Colson realize hisvulnerability there?EHRLICHMAN:Well, course Colson claims he has novulnerability, because when Hunt and Liddycome in to talk to him they talked in very general terms.PRESIDENT:I understand that.EHRLICHMAN:So, he...PRESIDENT:I -_ EHRLICHMAN:...doesn't acknowledge... PRESIDENT:IEHRLICHMAN:...he doesn't acknowledge that there's anypossibilityPRESIDENT:I, I understand that, but I'm just simplysaying, its...EHRLICHMAN:I think he's right. PRESIDENT:...that Hunt and Liddy could EHRLICHMAN:That's true.PRESIDENT:...could, could, could charge that -that'sthe point. They, they, they -if they talk, I would assume they would get into thatpoint with them, any, any cross-examiner.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.18EHRLICHMAN:I, I've asked Colson specifically about thatconversation and he maintains that they weretalking, uh, in general terms aboutintelligence and when they said intelligence he meant one thing and apparently they meantanother.PRESIDENT:Question, uh, for example, uh, is, is Huntpreparing to talk on other activities that he engaged in?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I couldn't, I couldn't derive that...PRESIDENT:-Umhmm. EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) at all.PRESIDENT:For the White House and for the -you know?EHRLICHMAN:I, I couldn't, I couldn't get that at all. PRESIDENT:The U.S. Attorney, I would assume, wouldnot be pressing (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:ordinarily not.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:Now, McCord, McCord volunteered this HankGreenspun thing, gratuitously apparently,not, notPRESIDENT:Could, can you tell me, is that a seriousthing? Did, did they really try to get intoHank Greenspun's?.EHRLICHMAN:I guess they actually got in. PRESIDENT:What in the name of Christ, though, doesHank Greenspun got with -anything to do withMitchell or anybody else?EHRLICHMAN:Nothing. Well, now, Mitchell PRESIDENT:Hughes?EHRLICHMAN:Here's -yeah, Hughes. And these twofellows, Colson and Shapiro, uh, uh -Colson threw that out.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.19PRESIDENT:Hughes on whom?EHRLICHMAN:Well, you know the Hughes thing is cut intotwo factions...PRESIDENT:I don't -- EHRLICHMAN:(A) and then the...PRESIDENT:Uh, fighting --EHRLICHMAN:...and then the other, and they're fighting. PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:Bennett, Senator Bennett's son, for whomHunt worked...PRESIDENT:Oh? EHRLICHMAN:represents one of those factions.PRESIDENT:Yeah. So he ordered the bugging?EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:...I know theSEVERAL VOICES:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:it's a bag job. HALDEMAN:They busted his safe to get something out ofit.EHRLICHMAN:NowHALDEMAN:Wasn't that it? They flew out, broke hissafe, got something outEHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:...got on the airplane and flew away. EHRLICHMAN:Now, as they sat there in my office... PRESIDENT:There're others...EHRLICHMAN:What?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.20PRESIDENT:...other delicate things, too. You've got,apart from my poor damn dumb brother, whichunfortunately or fortunately was a long timeago but, uh, more recently, you've got Herbert Humphrey's son works for him, and,of course, they're, they're tied in withO'Brien, I suppose. But maybe they were trying to get it for that reason.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know why. The, the two of them puton a little charade for me in the office...PRESIDENT:Shapiro and Colson? EHRLICHMAN:...as we -yeah -as we talked about this, andit may have been genuine and it may not.But...PRESIDENT:But they didn't know anything about it? EHRLICHMAN:...but they -no -they said, one said to theother, "Say, that may have something to dowith the New York Grand Jury," meaning the Vesco Grand Jury which is a runaway and which is intoPRESIDENT:You think Colson knew about that?EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. I don't say he knew about it.I said, he says he doesn't know even whoHank Greenspun is.PRESIDENT:He should. Everybody knows he's the editor.His son, for Christ's sakesEHRLICHMAN:I, I'll take him at face value on that one,uh, uh, it isn't any other evidence.PRESIDENT:You didn't know that either? EHRLICHMAN:I, I know very well who he is.PRESIDENT:Alright. Uh, let me just take a minutefurther and run out the Hunt thing, and then the Grand Jury. I just want to get all the pieces in my mind...EHRLICHMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:...if I can. EHRLICHMAN:Sure.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.21PRESIDENT:Uh, Hunt's testimony on pay-off, of course,would be very important.EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:Is he prepared to testify on that? EHRLICHMAN:I think so, that's what they say, that hewill, and that he will implicate O'Brien andParkinson. And, uh, then, of course, ah --PRESIDENT:O'Brien and Parkinson? EHRLICHMAN:The lawyers.PRESIDENT:Were they the ones that talked to Hunt?EHRLICHMAN:Well, he says they were and that they handedhim the money, He in turn handed it to hiswife and she was the, uh, go-between forthe...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...Cubans.PRESIDENT:For what purpose? That's the key to it all-.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think, uh, he'll, he'll hook, hang'em up on obstruction of justice.PRESIDENT:Can Hunt do that?HALDEMAN:How can he do that? Why would he simply -whydoesn't he accomplish his purpose simply by saying they gave the money to handle theirlegal fees?EHRLICHMAN:They're -all hang out there apparently. PRESIDENT:Now this is... HALDEMAN:I don't thinkPRESIDENT:...this, this is what Colson tells you guys?HALDEMAN:That's right. I don't... PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:...have any other information on this.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.21PRESIDENT:Uh, Hunt's testimony on pay-off, of course,would be very important.EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:Is he prepared to testify on that?

Hehas possible vulnerability as to whether he was aware, in other words, the motive, themotiveEHRLICHMAN:This doesn't add anything to the Kalmbachproblem at all.PRESIDENT:What happened...EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...what happened on that? EHRLICHMAN:Dean called Kalmbach.PRESIDENT:And what did Dean call Kalmbach about?EHRLICHMAN:And he said we have to raise some money inconnection with the, the, uh, uh, aftermath, and I don't know how he described it toHerb. Uh, Herb said how much do you need,and, uh...PRESIDENT:It was never discussed then? EHRLICHMAN:...presumably Dean told him and Herb went toa couple of donors and got some money andsent it back.HALDEMAN:Dean says very flatly that Kalmbach did notknow the purpose, uh, for the money and hasno problem.PRESIDENT:-Dean does know the purpose... UNIDENITIFIED:Right.PRESIDENT:however. Hunt testifies -so, so basicallythen Hunt will testify that it was so-called hush money. Right?EHRLICHMAN:I think so. Now that again, my water can'trise any higher than source.PRESIDENT:I understand. EHRLICHMAN:But that's that...APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.22PRESIDENT:What is your, what is your...EHRLICHMAN:...that's, thatPRESIDENT:What does that serve him, let me ask, justto try to, uhEHRLICHMAN:Gen...PRESIDENT:...I mean, would it serve him?EHRLICHMAN:The only thing it serves him is to, uh,uh...PRESIDENT:Would it reduce his sentence?EHRLICHMAN:...have his sentence remitted, that's all.HALDEMAN:Held be serving the same purpose by notsaying it was hush money -by, by saying hegave it to "these guys that I had recruitedfor this job and IPRESIDENT:I know. of HALDEMAN:...felt badly about their family and," youknow, "a great deal about it."PRESIDENT:That's right, that's what it ought to be andthat's got to be the story that, uh, and thatHALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...that will be the defense of, uh, thepeople, right?EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) the only defense they haveand so forth.HALDEMAN:But that PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:here that was the line that he had usedaroundPRESIDENT:What?HALDEMAN:That was the line that they used aroundhere. That we've got to have money for their legal fees and family sup-...APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.24PRESIDENT:Support them. Well, I heard something aboutthat at a much later time.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And, frankly, not knowing much aboutobstruction of justice, I thought it wasperfectly proper.EHRLICHMAN:Well, it's like the... PRESIDENT:Would it be perfectly proper? EHRLICHMAN:...the defense of the...PRESIDENT:Berrigans?EHRLICHMAN:...the, uh, Chicago Seven. PRESIDENT:The Chicago Seven?HALDEMAN:They had a defense fund for everybody.PRESIDENT:Not only a defense fund, Christ, they, theytake care of the living expenses, too...UNIDENTIFIED:Was there any --PRESIDENT:...despite what all this crap about justlegal fees, they take care of themselves. They raise -you remember the Scottsboro case? Christ. The, uh, uh, the Communistfront raised a million dollars for theScottsboro people. Nine hundred thousand went into the pockets of the Scotts-, er,uh, Communists.HALDEMAN:(Laughs). PRESIDENT:...so it's common practice.

Alright -Hunt, on other activities: uh, Hunt then according toColson was not, uh -(tape noise) get into.What Colson meant about the door of the Oval Office.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.25EHRLICHMAN:Uh, I'll have to get back to you on that,'cause Shapiro was there and I didn't wantto get into it.PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:He --HALDEMAN:No, but it wasn't, it was in connection PRESIDENT:No, notit was.in an earlierconversation...HALDEMAN:Your instructions saidPRESIDENT:...about the Magruder conversation... HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...when Colson was, uh -I think on theMagruder conversation, from what I have seenEHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:...it seems to me thatEHRLICHMAN:...'cause Magruder doesn't got to the doorof the Oval Office. He doesn't even come to visit me...PRESIDENT:-I know that.EHRLICHMAN:...in the White House.PRESIDENT:But he, he -it is Colson's, it is Colson'sview that Magruder's talking would have theeffect of bringing it there because of the-I think what he's really referring to, John, is that by reason of Colson, uh, by reason of Magruder nailing Haldeman and, er,and Colson, that that's the door to the OvalOffice. I don't know what else because...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...there's nobody else around, nobodyphysically around.HALDEMAN:Magruder isn't going to nail Haldeman.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.26PRESIDENT:Well, let's see. I don't think so either,butHALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Well that is, that tape is, is invaluable,is it not?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, I suggest to Bob that he keep it.HALDEMAN:And I disregard that as (unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:(Laughs) PRESIDENT:Let me just say a couple of things that wehave to get there. We, we, uh...HALDEMAN:Well, when we come to that, we'd take(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...in regard to your, regard to your, uh,uh, your, your views and so forth and so on, now, uh I was told the other day, uh, last night, John, you and Bob or somebody -Iguess you and I were talking about, uh,somebody going to see Mitchell. And you suggested Rogers. Got any other better names? Why did you...EHRLICHMAN:Well, I've been up and down the list, and uhPRESIDENT:...why did you suggest Rogers? EHRLICHMAN:Well, I suggested Rogers becausePRESIDENT:First let me tell you -purpose of missiontell me what it is, now.EHRLICHMAN:The purpose of the mission is to go andbring him to a focus on this and I'd say,"The jig is up. And the President stronglyfeels that the only way that this thing can end up being even a little net plus for theAdministration and for the Presidency andpreserve some thread is for you to go in and, and, uh, voluntarily, uh, make a statement.PRESIDENT:A statement that Haldeman, uh, has prepared.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, uh, a, a sta-, statement that basicallysays...APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.27HALDEMAN:No. He's got to go beyond that.EHRLICHMAN:"I am, I am both morally and legallyresponsible."PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Now, the reason for Rogers is that he'sclean, number one...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...uh, he has been both, uh, AttorneyGeneral and has this other investigatory...PRESIDENT:Right.[Irrelevant portion omitted]EHRLICHMAN:Now, the other, the only other alternative,going up and down the list --HALDEMAN:Also, it from a public viewpoint Rogers isthe dean of the Cabinet...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and is the logical man as, n as anattorney, and former Attorney General.PRESIDENT:From a public viewpoint, that may be but,alsoEHRLICHMAN:Fifty reasons not to do this.HALDEMAN:You've thought of those?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.27HALDEMAN:No. He's got to go beyond that.EHRLICHMAN:"I am, I am both morally and legallyresponsible."PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Now, the reason for Rogers is that he'sclean, number one...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...uh, he has been both, uh, AttorneyGeneral and has this other investigatory...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...and Senatorial background and so forth.And there isn't anybody that Mitchelltrusts, except Haldeman.PRESIDENT:He hates Rogers. EHRLICHMAN:I understand. HALDEMAN:Doesn't, doesn't trust Rogers but he wouldknow if Rogers came...EHRLICHMAN:That it was... HALDEMAN:that it was you. EHRLICHMAN:Now, the other, the only other alternative,going up and down the listHALDEMAN:Also, it from a public viewpoint Rogers isthe dean of the Cabinet...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and is the logical man as, n as anattorney, and former Attorney General.PRESIDENT:From a public viewpoint, that may be but,alsoEHRLICHMAN:Fifty reasons not to do this. HALDEMAN:You've thought of those?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.28PRESIDENT:Oh, yeah. Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:There, there, and ther, there haveconsistently been -you go back through thehistory of thisPRESIDENT:I know, but now is the time to do something.I agree with you.EHRLICHMAN:Now is the only time, probably, and I'm, I'mpersuaded by that argument.PRESIDENT:Oh, I am too. I'm, I'm not, -I'm notarguing about not doing it...EHRLICHMAN:I understand. PRESIDENT:...I'm just trying to talk about the namesEHRLICHMAN:Okay. Uh, in, in going down the list, JohnAlexander is the only other one that I have come to that, that in any way could, could bridge it. Garment can't do it.PRESIDENT:Now, let me give you another name...EHRLICHMAN:Alright. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) President. PRESIDENT:...let me give you another name. Ken Rush.(Unintelligible). He's a fine lawyer,utterly clean. Uh, a long-time friend of Mitchell's -not a close friend, but he'sknown him, you know, in New York, uh, andthat grew up there, they are, they, you know, they sort of -Rush would understand it all. Uh, Mitchell does not hate him -doestrust him.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know how able Rush is. I'd, uh-he's got -uh, I just don't know. Uh,another name -uh, two other names that haveoccurred to me that I 111 throw out, uh, one is Eliot Richardson and the other is, uh, uh, Kleindienst. There is anotherpossibility and that's Henry Petersen.Well, that of course...PRESIDENT:WellEHRLICHMAN:...but he's in the prosecutorial end.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.29PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And so is Kleindienst.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's the trouble. PRESIDENT:Kleindienst, Kleindienst revealing toMitchell the contents of the Grand Jury andall the rest...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...is wrong.EHRLICHMAN:I, I must say I am impressed with theargument that the President should be personally involved in it at this stage.,PRESIDENT:Right. I agree.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, old John, uh, Dean had a, had aninteresting -got a phone call from him about 12:30.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Oh, no. I was working on something I'lltell you about here.PRESIDENT:What did you do?EHRLICHMAN:Uh, well, not much last night.PRESIDENT:You mean another subject? EHRLICHMAN:Oh, no. No, this --HALDEMAN:There is no other subject. (Laughs)EHRLICHMAN:This week there's no other subject. PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:That, uh, no, I'll tell you. Last nightwhen I got home I decided that, that, uh, Iwould sit down and try to put down on paper a report to you about what I have been doingsince you asked me to get into this.PRESIDENT:Right, right.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.30EHRLICHMAN:Uh, I am concerned about the overall aspect ofthis and then -I want to talk about thatbefore we --PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know what your timing is like.PRESIDENT:No problem. EHRLICHMAN:We'll probably get back to it.PRESIDENT:Uh, got plenty of time.EHRLICHMAN:But, Dean called and he said, "Alright, here'sa scenario."He said, "We&#8482;ve all been tryingto figure outPRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:how to make this go.&#64258; He says, "The Presidentcalls Mitchell into his office on Saturday.He says, 'John, you've got to do this and hereare the facts: bing, bing, bing, bing.'Andthen that's -you pull this paper out here.And you'd better go do this. And Mitchellstonewalls you. So then, John says, 11 don'tknow why you're asking me down here. You can'task a man to do a thing like that. I need mylawyer. Uh, uh, I don't know what I'm facing? He says, 'You just really can't expect me todo this?'Uh, so the President says, 'Well,John, I have no alternative.' And with that,uh, uh, the President calls the U.S. Attorneyand says, 'I, the President of the UnitedStates of America and leader of the free worldwant to go before the Grand Jury on Monday."'PRESIDENT:I won't even comment on that.HALDEMAN:That's a silly (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:What I mean is, we're -typical of the thinkingof -we're running out every, every line. Sothat was 12:30 this morning. I, uh, uh, but,but IPRESIDENT:I go before the Grand Jury -that's...EHRLICHMAN:...IAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.31PRESIDENT:That's like putting Bob on nationaltelevision uh...HALDEMAN:With Dan Rather.PRESIDENT:What? HALDEMAN:With Dan Rather.PRESIDENT:...well, well by putting it on nationaltelevision period. When, uh, your, uh, when your, -when your audience basically is not that big.EHRLICHMAN:Well, let's, let's take it just as far asyou calling Mitchell into the Oval Office, as a, as a(Tape noise)EHRLICHMAN:...essentially convinced that Mitchell was-linchpin in this thing...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...and that if he goes down, it can redoundto the administration's advantage. If he doesn't then we're --PRESIDENT:How can it redound to our advantage?EHRLICHMAN:That...PRESIDENT:There's others EHRLICHMAN:...That. You have a report from me based onthree weeks' work, that when you got it youimmediately acted to call Mitchell in as the, as the provable. . .PRESIDENT:I see.EHRLICHMAN:...wrong-doer...PRESIDENT:I see. EHRLICHMAN:...and you say, "My God, I've got a reporthere. And it's clear from this report thatyou are guilty as hell. Now, John, for Christ's sake go on in there and do what you should. And let's get this thing cleared upand get it off the country's back and moveon.&#64258; And, uh, uh --APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.32HALDEMAN:Well, plus the given side of it is thatthat's the only...PRESIDENT:Even way to--HALDEMAN:...way to beat 'er down. PRESIDENT:Well --HALDEMAN:Now, from John Mitchell's own personalviewpoint that's the only salvation for John Mitchell. -Can you see another way? And, obviously, once you have it, you've -he'sgot to admit it.PRESIDENT:He's, he's not gonna make it, anyway. HALDEMAN:Another factor in that to consider for whatit's worth, is the point Connally made to mein that conversation we had on this.PRESIDENT:I ought to talk to Mitchell? HALDEMAN:I don't know whether he said this to you ornot. He made the point that you had to getthis laid out and that the only way it could hurt you is if it ultimately went to Mitchell. And that, that would be the oneman you couldn't afford to let get hung onthis.PRESIDENT:-Even worse than Hughes talk.HALDEMAN:He thought so. Seemed to be...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) That's true. Yeah. HALDEMAN:...seemed to be, because he's the epitome ofyour...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...your hard line. PRESIDENT:I think he's wrong about that. I think thisis the the worst one, well, due, due to thecloseness to the President at the time of the crime.HALDEMAN:ButPRESIDENT:Would you agree, John?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.33HALDEMAN:Well, what's badEHRLICHMAN:That's the way I see it.HALDEMAN:But, what Connally also said was unless it'sthe President himself who nails Mitchell, then the President is (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Can I pull up this into the larger, in alarger picture? We've gotta live day to day through these things...UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...and forget, uh, the, uh, perspective thatwill be put on this period...UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...three months later.PRESIDENT:The point is whether or not -I think I'vegot the larger picture -I think, I mean I, and I, in this regard, the point is thisthat the -we need some action before, uh -inother words, if, if it's like my, my feeling about having the Grand Jury do it and the court system do it rather than ErvinCommittee -now we want the President to doit rather than the Grand Jury.EHRLICHMAN:No.PRESIDENT:And I agree with that.EHRLICHMAN:Well, you're doing it in aid of the GrandJury.PRESIDENT:No. No. I didn't mean it. I didn't meanrather than the Grand Jury, but I mean to,to, to, to worm the truth -now look, 1, 1 -the Grand Jury doesn't drag him in, he goesin as a result of the President's asking himto go in.HALDEMAN:Okay. But while you're at that point couldI argue a contrary view for a minute? 'CauseI don't agree with that.PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.34HALDEMAN:I strongly feel, thinking it through, with all thestuff we talked about last night, that you don'twant to rush in and that the solution here, if we can find it -maybe it's impossible, is...PRESIDENT:Is for Mitchell to come voluntarily? HALDEMAN:Well, or for Magruder to come voluntarily and nailMitchell. But if the solution is -I agree that some sort ofPRESIDENT:Where does Magruder come to? Me?HALDEMAN:No. The, the U.S. Attorney. That--PRESIDENT:Well, why does -why don't I urge Magruder to I meanlet me, let me look at this. The urging of Liddy to testify, the urging of Magruder to testify and Mitchell. John run those by, by -I didn't mean to stop your...EHRLICHMAN:No, that's alright. PRESIDENT:...your whole analysis but I think, I think I knowwhat you're, what, what, what -isn't that reallythe essence of it?EHRLICHMAN:I'm trying to write the news magazine story fornext Monday...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN: a week, Monday a week. And, if it is that"Grand Jury Indicts Mitchell"...PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:..."The White House main effort to cover up, uh,finally collapsed last week when the Grand Jury indicted John Mitchell and Jeb Magruder,PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...and uh, "Cracking the case was the testimony ofa, a number of, uh, peripheral witnesses who -each of whom contributed to developing a, a uh, cross-triangulation and permitted the Grand Jury to analyze it,," and so on and so forth. And then "thefinal, the final straw that broke the camel's backwas, uh, an investigator's dis covery of this and that and the other thing." That's one set of facts. Uh, uh, and then the tag on that is "The White House Press Secretary Ron Ziegler said that the White House would have no comment."APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.35PRESIDENT:I know, I know. It can't be done.EHRLICHMAN:The other one, the other one goes: "Eventsmoved swiftly last week, after the Presidentwas presented with a report indicating that,uh, uh -for the first time -that, uh, uhsuspicion of John Mitchell and, uh, Jeb Magruder as ring-leaders in the uh, Watergatebreak-in were in fact substantiated by, uh,considerable evidence. Uh, the Presidentthen, uh, uh, dispatched so and so to do thisand that and it"-maybe to see Mitchell or, orsomething of that kind and, uh, uh --" theseefforts, uh, resulted in Mitchell going to the U.S. Attorney's office on Monday morning atnine o'clock, uh, asking to, uh, testifybefore the Grand Jury. Uh, uh, charges-ofcover-up, uh, by the White House were, uh, uh,materially dispelled by the diligent effortsof the President and his aides in, uh, movingon evidence which came to their hands in thein the closing days of the previous week.&#64258; AhPRESIDENT:I, I'd buy that. EHRLICHMAN:Okay.PRESIDENT:-You want to -so, we get down to the tactics.EHRLICHMAN:Now, I've been concerned because since the endof March, I have turned up a fair amount of-hearsay evidence that, that points at thisguy. Now, just takePRESIDENT:And so did Dean... EHRLICHMAN:And, and so did John.PRESIDENT:...so did Dean.EHRLICHMAN:Now, taking thisPRESIDENT:Yet we've tried, very honestly, we've triedto, tried to look at it the best way we could.Maybe he couldn't, maybe he really didn'tknow.EHRLICHMAN:Well, it's hearsay. And so, he...PRESIDENT:That point.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.36EHRLICHMAN:...you don't hang a guy, you don't hang aguy necessarilyPRESIDENT:And also, we are going to remember, Mitchellhas denied it.EHRLICHMAN:But I was, I st-, stood over there in Bob'soffice and listened to that tape of one ofthe co-actors saying, flat out on the tape, that he-was guilty -and that Mitchell was gonna, was going to fall and all that and Isaid toPRESIDENT:Did he say that? Did he say that? HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Well, we can'tEHRLICHMAN:...and, and I said to myself, "My God ! I'ma, you know, I mean, I'm a United States citizen. I'm standing here listening tothis, what is my duty?"PRESIDENT:Well the point is you've now told me.That's the problem.EHRLICHMAN:That's correct, that's correct.PRESIDENT:You see, the differ uh, uh, the uh, theproblem of my position up to this time has been, quite frankly, nobody ever told me aGod-damn thing...EHRLICHMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:...that Mitchell was guilty EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:I mean, uh --HALDEMAN:Well, we still don't know. PRESIDENT:I, I...HALDEMAN:I don't...PRESIDENT:must say--APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.37HALDEMAN:I, I will still argue that I think thescenario that was spilled, uh, spin, spunout, that Dean spun out to Mitchell isbasically the right one. ...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...I don't think Mitchell did order theWatergate bugging and I don't think he was specifically aware of the Watergate bugging at the time it was instituted.PRESIDENT:Well, let me --HALDEMAN:I honestly don't. PRESIDENT:That may be. Now[Short irrelevant portion omitted]APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.38HALDEMAN:Okay. I still think that technically thatmay be correct.EHRLICHMAN:I think so -'cause that's what he toldMoore. And he believes that.PRESIDENT:What did he say? Could he tell Moore?EHRLICHMAN:Well, remember, 1, he, I asked Moore to findout what Mitchell had testified to.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's right. And Mooreheard the testimony and-said well you'renot--EHRLICHMAN:He, he was never asked the right questions.Now, uh, uh, as far as he's concerned...HALDEMAN:He probably didn't in the Grand Jury either.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. As far as the quality of theevidence is concernedPRESIDENT:May I just, uh, digress for one point, thathas nothing to do with this except thatyou've got to fight what's going on damn soon. It is essential that, uh, Roger's departure be delayed until this is over.Now, the hell with Henry on this. The pointis, any member of the-cabinet, except Kleindientst, leaving during this -there'sno way that Dick is gonna leave anyway -and,uh, now you gotta talk to Hen-, you gotta just "And Henry it's not appealable.&#64258; You just gotta say that, "Henry, there arebigger things here." With RogersEHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible).

No. HALDEMAN:I don't know.EHRLICHMAN:Well, uh, to go back to...PRESIDENT:Alright. We won't EHRLICHMAN:the quality of the evidence PRESIDENT:...I only mentioned Bebe because(unintelligible) let me -let's get -go aheadwith your --EHRLICHMAN:Well, all I was going to say is that --PRESIDENT:Alright. I now have evidence, I amconvinced...EHRLICHMAN:But you, you don't have evidence if, uh, uh,if IPRESIDENT:I'm not convinced he's guilty.EHRLICHMAN:That's it. PRESIDENT:...but I am convinced that he ought to gobefore a Grand Jury,EHRLICHMAN:Exactly. Uh, and, and, and it -what I didlast night, or this morning, was to write out what would, uh, would in effect be areport to you...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...of, of this, of this... PRESIDENT:Let me ask you wheter--EHRLICHMAN:(unintelligible) deliver it to you.PRESIDENT:John(pause) Go see Mitchell.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.40HALDEMAN:(Laughs).EHRLICHMAN:Uh, all I know about my relationship withMitchell from his side is what others tellme. He has never, he's never, uh, never (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:The Mitchell problem, the Mitchell problemwith Rogers has been totally created.EHRLICHMAN:I see.(PRIVILEGED MATERIAL DELETED)PRESIDENT:...Let's come around, let's come aroundagain though. You know the case. You've conducted the investigation for me. Youhave reported to me and I have asked you togo up and lay it on the ground to Mitchell and to tell Mitchell, look, there is only one thing that could save him. I thinkJohn's got to hear that kind of talk and Ithink he's got to hear it from somebody that doesn't have -I was thinking of bringing Rogers in and telling him all this stuff,but God-damn it, Mitchell will wind himaround his finger.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah.PRESIDENT:...well, there's our probnem.EHRLICHMAN:If you want me to go, I'll go. PRESIDENT:I think the message... EHRLICHMAN:I don't know what he thinksPRESIDENT:...but the message to Garcia has got to becarried &#338;EHRLICHMAN:Bob, Bob has a pretty good feel ofMitchell's attitude toward me that I don'thave.PRESIDENT:Well, Mitchell's attitude toward you is notgoing to be personal -it isn't going to beany better for Rogers. It would be towardRush...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, but how in the name of God can --APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.41PRESIDENT:...Rush is smart and he is tough. He's agood man. And, uh, he's a man, incidentallythat we can considerEHRLICHMAN:He can't argue the facts of this case,that's the point.PRESIDENT:The point is, Rush is a man that I wouldcons if you need a special man in the White House I was thinking last night that he is the best man I can think of...EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...to bring over to advise the President onthis God-damn thing and -no, and examine allthe White House things, to look at all theFBI files, to looker your report, Dean report, the FBI files and give me a report. He's articulate, he's, he's, uh, beforetelevision he's, uh, respected among, uh-he's one of the towering figures in the Ambassadorial world and in the bar. He is, he's no slouch.EHRLICHMAN:Bobby?PRESIDENT:And an outsider's -good God, it's going totake so long to -Rush, I trust. Rush is afriend. He's a total White House man and yethe is not, not tied into this.EHRLICHMAN:He's exactly the kind of guy we need. Now,I don't know how he, he is in person -hehasn't practiced law for a long time.That's not, that's not an immediate drawback but, but, *uhPRESIDENT:He has the lawyer's mind.EHRLICHMAN:...you got to get him somebody to help him,like, uh, uh --HALDEMAN:Haven't though, haven't events overtakenthat project?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.42PRESIDENT:Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Bob, for Christ'ssake, will you -look, the point that I make islet's suppose they get Mitchell.

I've got to have a report indicating -in other words, you've got all that wholeSegretti crap in there. I want somebody tosay, now look, here are the facts. None ofthe White House people were involved. Thereare no other higher-ups. The White House wasnot involved. Put a cap around it. And, andsecond...EHRLICHMAN:More than thatPRESIDENT:...and then face the Segretti crap.EHRLICHMAN:I, I, in, in forcing this out, Dean remains aproblem and, and, uh, here's -uh, let me justread you what I've come to on that...PRESIDENT:Alright.EHRLICHMAN:"John Dean has not involved himself in thismatter as your counsel for several months andproperly so. I should not continue to fill in for him," meaning me, "for several reasons,including the impermissable demands on my timethat are involved.REEL 2 BEGINSYou need a full-time special counsel to followthese related problems who can advise you ofthe legal niceties from his experience in constitutional, criminal and governmentalpractice. I'll be happy to continue toconsult with him, and soon. I do notrecommend that Dean take a leave. That isneither in nor out. He has involved himselfto the extent described above. Either thatREEL 1 ENDSrequires dismissal or it does not. And thatchoice should be made at once. If he is discharged, the U.S. Attorney and the GrandJury should treat him differently. But Ithink he's, he -you've got to bite the bulleton Dean, one way or the other, pretty quick.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.43PRESIDENT:Alright. But...EHRLICHMAN:But recognize, uh,HALDEMAN:What did Dean say to...EHRLICHMAN:...but recognize... HALDEMAN:...what did Dean say to...EHRLICHMAN:that kills him.HALDEMAN:Dean's. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah basically he says that kills him. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) and he got off with pleabargaining for a misdemeanor.HALDEMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:A misdemeanor. HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:That's all the God-damn thing ever was.HALDEMAN:Yeah. And he got an undetermined sentencethat was suspended Friday.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:He never served an hour in jail.PRESIDENT:Didn't serve in jail and then, but, but, notonly -you see, BobHALDEMAN:He was indicted on a felonyPRESIDENT:He did not -indicted on a felony...APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.44HALDEMAN:Pled to a --PRESIDENT:Plea, plea-bargained to a misdemeanor, getsoff with, uh, no sentence and so forth and,and Dash defends him and says that -and Lipschitz. goes out and the Post printsreams of stuff that he...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible).

Nowwhat really --HALDEMAN:He had already been indicted on two otherPRESIDENT:How in the hell, who got the, got that storyout (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Well, they, apparently, the two or threepapers got wind of it, but the interesting thing is that Dash had made the moral judgment...PRESIDENT:Earlier.HALDEMAN:...that, that didn't disqualify him, he knewabout it.PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:And Dash has a beautiful statement on thefront page of the paper which is a man wouldn't be as good an investigator if hehadn't been inPRESIDENT:Unless he knew how to bug. HALDEMAN:...(unintelligible). No, unless he had beenin trouble a couple of, one or two times.EHRLICHMAN:Ervin must have looked at that and...SEVERAL VOICES:(Unintelligible).

Itwould be my (tape noise) a reasonable time hadexpired after the thing (unintelligible, withtape noise) and before I leave office and they'll get off. You get them full pardons.That's what they have to have, John.EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:Do you agree?EHRLICHMAN:Yep, I sure do. Well, you haven't asked me howI'd come out on this. I just, I just broughtit to a focus. I think if you have to decideup or down on Dean now...PRESIDENT:What do you think about that? Oh, let's see.What, what does Dean say when you tell himthat?EHRLICHMAN:He doesn't agree with that.PRESIDENT:I know he doesn't agree, but what does he do?EHRLICHMAN:He wants to stay and just disconnect himselffrom this case. And he says, "Yes, that'sright, make your decision now, but make your decision that I should stay.&#64258; He needn'tdecide that right this minute and I wouldencourage him not to...PRESIDENT:I mean.EHRLICHMAN:...but in talking about Rush, that relates tothis general subject. I think I would pass itfor the moment.PRESIDENT:But the only thing that I was -yeah, I agreeyou shouldAPRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.46EHRLICHMAN:And, and, uh, get back to, get back to theMitchell thing which really is, uh...PRESIDENT:Like today. I know. EHRLICHMAN:...uh, like this morning. PRESIDENT:I don't think there's anybody that can talk toMitchellexcept somebody that knows this case.Now, there's one or two people, I mean I versedmyself in it enough to know the God-damn thing, but I'm not sure that I want to know. Iwant to say Mitchell, "Now, look, I, I think that, I think that you're -the attorneys for the Committee, O'Brien -and I found out this, andI found out that, and I found out that, and theGrand Jury has told me this th-th-th-th-th dee.&#64258; I just don't know. I just don't -you know what I mean. They talk about my going out is, uh -but really, I am not trying to duck it. I, I don't mind, I've done unpleasant things and I'll take this in one minute. Uh, the thing, John,is that there's nobody really that can do itexcept you.-And I know how Mitchell feels. But you conducted this investigation. I would -the. way I would do it, Bob, you, you critique this, is I'd go up, and I'd say,...HALDEMAN:Alright.PRESIDENT:..."The President's asked me to see you." Thatyou have come in today with this report; these are the cold facts indicating; of course, that this does not indicate that, but the Grand Jury is moving swiftly, Magruder will be indicted, you think. Under the circumstances, time is ofthe essence. You can't be in a position ofhaving you (tape noise) the Grand Jury and (tape noise) (unintelligible) "I am responsible, I did not know it. But I assume the responsibility. Nobody in the White House is involved," and so forth, and so on. "We did try to help thesedefendants after wards, yes."He probablywould not deny that anyway. He probably was not asked that at an earlier time. But the, just as the def-, just as any, the defendants are entitled to that sort ofEHRLICHMAN:Well now you're, you're glossing it. Uh, Idon't think he could do that.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.47PRESIDENT:All right.EHRLICHMAN:I wouldn'twant to, I wouldn't wantto...PRESIDENT:All right. EHRLICHMAN:...have you...PRESIDENT:Oh all right.EHRLICHMAN:(unintelligible). PRESIDENT:Fine, fine., What would you say to him? EHRLICHMAN:I'd say (unintelligible)...PRESIDENT:Let me, let me hear your speech(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I'd say, "The jig, you know, basically, thejig is up, John, and uh, I've listened to,uh, Magruder and, and, uh, uh, uh, he's gonna, he's in my opinionhe's about to blow, uh, uh, and that's, that'sthe laststraw."Uh --PRESIDENT:And, also, Hunt is going to testify,Tuesday, Monday, we understand.EHRLICHMAN:"We'vegot to, we've got to think of thisthing from thestandpoint of the Presidentand I know you havebeen right along and that's the reason you'vebeenconductingyourself as you have."PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:"It, it's now time, I think, to rethink whatbest servesthe President and also whatbest serves you toPRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:in the ultimate outcome of this thing,"PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:"And wehave to, have to, recognize thatyou are not going to escape indictment. There's no way andPRESIDENT:Becauseyeah.

HALDEMAN:I have a couple of modifications to that.One, a minor ques-not to what you say, butin setting it up. It would be helpful, indoing that, if I called Mitchell and said that the President wants you to talk withhim. Then there's no question. . .PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...in his mind... PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:...that you're, you're operatingPRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...unilaterally. EHRLICHMAN:Absolutely.PRESIDENT:Right, right.HALDEMAN:And, secondly, that if at all possible, heshould come down here.EHRLICHMAN:Why is that?HALDEMAN:Well, my reason for it is, A, you get himhere under your circumstances. B if you make your case, which you may(unintelligible) at this point...PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:...'cause he may be on the same track.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.50PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...maybe at the same point.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:If he is, you might be able thento swing a"let's get Silbert right now and go on over."Ah, he may say, I've got to talk to the President before I do this.PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:And then run him in to do it.PRESIDENT:Um, well, let me say, let me saythis, uh,I've, I've run, run through my mind, uh, the,the thoughts. And believe me the ideaofRogers, as you, John, as Bob will tell you, is not, is not one that, uh, that I don't thinkis, is potentially good. I was hoping to gethim in, in a bigger but I, I know Rogerslike the back of my hand and Rogers does notfight real, meantough problems and he willnot go.HALDEMAN:The trouble with Rogers is that Mitchell willoverrun him. Mitchell will say, "Bill, you'reout of your fucking mind. If you knew what I knew -I mean those kids over at theWhite House I are, are looking at me and, uh,and, uhPRESIDENT:What if you knew what I knew, what about them?HALDEMAN:Well, he'd roll his eyes and, andRogerswouldn't know one way or the other.PRESIDENT:You see, John, somebody has to talk to him whoknows the facts. That's the point.HALDEMAN:And as I mentioned (unintelligible, with tapenoise) thing in your scenario that reallyworries me when you say I've listened toMagruderEHRLICHMAN:Well, all, all right, I can't say it quitethat waySEVERAL VOICES:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...what Magruder's gonna do.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.51EHRLICHMAN:I can say...PRESIDENT:We have learned from...EHRLICHMAN:I can, IPRESIDENT:...we have learned that Magruder is going totestify.EHRLICHMAN:I can say, well, I can start out by saying,look, I can't vouch for any of this first hand. A tremendous amount of what I know is second-hand, like my conversation with PaulO'Brien, but I have every reason to thinkthat Magruder is in a frame of mind right now to go down there and tell every thing heknows.PRESIDENT:That Hunt's going to go Monday(unintelligible)...EHRLICHMAN:Hunt's going to go Monday.PRESIDENT:and Liddy, well, you can't say LiddyEHRLICHMAN:Well PRESIDENT:maybe Mitchell has a feel-- EHRLICHMAN:I have, I have reason to think Liddy hasalready talked.HALDEMAN:You know Rothblatt knows who(unintelligible) Rothblatt. So they'reobviously moving on the cover-up.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:See, if Mitchell went in, that might knockthat whole week into a cocked hat.PRESIDENT:Why?HALDEMAN:Well, what do they care about the cover-upany more? TheyPRESIDENT:Humph.EHRLICHMAN:Well, they might, but they, but,you see,Mitchell if Mitchell gave them a complete statement...APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.52PRESIDENT:I wish they wouldn't, but (unintelligible)they would, Bob.EHRLICHMAN:...if Mitchell gave them a completestatementPRESIDENT:They shouldn't, I mean, you're right. Imean, the, the, the cover-up, he said that,uh -said well that basically it's a separate crime. Isn't that right, John?EHRLICHMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:Do you think they would keep going on thecover up even if Mitchell went in?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I would assume so. I would certainlyassume so. You see, they're got to explainto the Ervin Committee some day why they do things and they've got a hell of a lead. They're really not in shape to stop at thispoint. They would certainly be diverted.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible with tape noise) is this,that everything relating to this and all the fringes of it and all the, well, any other--EHRLICHMAN:I think they're in a position to uh -I, Ijust don't know (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Yeah, that's right.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:But the point is what, what they have that-they, their relations have Veen primarilywith Dean.HALDEMAN:I don't know about Colson. EHRLICHMAN:I don't either.HALDEMAN:Well, Dean isPRESIDENT:I have to bite the Dean bullet today.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.53EHRLICHMAN:I didn't say that. I didn't say that, but Ithink it, it is, it is a dependent question.And, uh, if you are in a situation whereMitchell stonewalls you...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...and walks out and says you know, to hellwith you guys, I've got to, I've got to live my own life.PRESIDENT:Well, let's say, uh, we could uh, uh, what,uh, I want to look at my watch, not becauseof an appointment.EHRLICHMAN:You've got a dentist appointment.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I've been here since eighto'clock this morning.EHRLICHMAN:That's why? SEVERAL VOICES:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Don't worry about that. No, that's noproblem. I could have got Haig to--but, uh, John Dean out of the Grand Jury.EHRLICHMAN:Let me get around that by sug-, suggestingwhat I think his response would be.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:His response will be,"Look, Ehrlichman,you're supposed to be a lawyer. You knowbetter. To go to somebody who is a target in an inquiry of this kind and try to pressure into giving up his rights is very antithesisof what rights I would have if I were adefendant...PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;Uh, you're supposed to, you're in theexecutive branch, and a government official, you're supposed to tell me what, what all the chips are.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.54PRESIDENT:Uh, that, that chair's gone.HALDEMAN: oh.SEVERAL VOICES:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...a couple and fall on the floor whichwould not be --PRESIDENT:Go ahead Steve.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, "you're supposed to tell me, uh, that Ihave a right to counsel and, uh, you know, read me the, the uh, Supreme Court thing(unintelligible) and so forth. Instead ofthat, you just suggested that I, uh, I divest myself of all my rights, and, uh, anduh, you, uh, asked me down here for a highlyimproper conversation. You haven't even suggested that I bring my attorney. And I take it what you are doing, is, uh, you'reacting as the, uh, prosecutor in this case."How do you come off doing that?PRESIDENT:He won't do that, in my opinion. Uh I thinkhe's more likely to say,"well God-damn it,look, John, we -don't you know that thereare people in the White House that are deeply involved in this. Don't you knowthat Colson and Haldeman...HALDEMAN:He may say this, yeah. PRESIDENT:...pressured this poor boy over here. Ithink Mitchell will take the offensive.Don't you agree? Bob?HALDEMAN:You see, I'm not at all sure but whatMitchell may think I am involved. I'm surehe probably thinks Colson's involved,because Magruder has used that. I would guess that the line Magruder has used with Mitchell -and you might have to playMagruder's tape recording for him(unintelligible)APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.55EHRLICHMAN:Well I don't think, I don't think that'llhappen. I just don't.HALDEMAN:Well, I justPRESIDENT:Is Magruder planning to go see Mitchell? HALDEMAN:Yes, sir, and it's -if he decides to go, ifhe decides to talk.PRESIDENT:If he decides to talk, he's convinced. HALDEMAN:And he's about on the verge,--his I, Iassume from that conversation that what hehas decided, he is either going to talk orhe's going to take the Fifth. He's not going to lie, over and over.PRESIDENT:But, they're not calling himthey may notcall him back, that's alwaysEHRLICHMAN:That's correct. (Unintelligible) Liddy willnever try it.PRESIDENT:Well the Fifth (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:He says, I know I'm going to be arrested. Iknow I'm on my way to jail. All right, if,if Mitchell comes back with a line likethat, you're not serving the President, well, if you have made any kind ofinvestigation surely you know people in theWhite House are involved.PRESIDENT:What do you say? EHRLICHMAN:I say, look, John, we're past the pointwhere we can be concerned about whetherpeople in the White House are involved. We're not protecting the President by hopingthis thing is going go go away."PRESIDENT:The people in the White House are going totestify.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.56EHRLICHMAN:The thing is not going to go away, John, andby your sitting up there in New York andpretending that it is, it's just making itworse. And it's been getting steadily worse on account of your sitting up there for thelast couple of months. We're at the pointnow where we have no choice but to ask you to do this.HALDEMAN:We have a whole, and you could say, we havea whole series of people who have remainedmum in order not to create problems for you, who, it's now clear, can no longer remainmum. They don't intend to create problemsfor you, but, I mean...PRESIDENT:Like Hunt, Liddy? HALDEMAN:No. I mean like Haldeman, DeanEHRLICHMAN:I could say that when I got into this I discovered that there were all kinds of people sitting around here who had bits of information. They were hanging on to them,becuase they didn't know where they led...PRESIDENT:Well - EHRLICHMAN:...and because they were afraid they wouldhurt John Mitchell. And I've had to putthis whole thing together. And now, having put it together...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) you guys received word hecomes downEHRLICHMAN:it, there's just no escape from it, just noescape.HALDEMAN:And it's got to be proved whether, uh,any...APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.57PRESIDENT:The adversary type. There's nobody that cando it --HALDEMAN:He will be able to persuade anyone elsethere is a way.PRESIDENT:But, there is nobody else that can do it.Also (pause) let me digress a moment beforewe get to the (unintelligible) of Mitchell. Another indication of the, the problem we've got here, uh, is -which is related to whatwe talked about last night -is to just tokeep a, a posture vis-a&#352;vis the Committee on this. Uh, I just think we are in animpossible position frankly, with regard toWhite House people not appearing before the Committee. Now you've gone over that with Ziegler and he still thinks me shouldstonewall it on those grounds.HALDEMAN:That's right. EHRLICHMAN:And I've, I have not talked with him atlength for days.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.79PRESIDENT:(Tape noise) we came full circle on theMit-, on the Mitchell thing.UNIDENTIFIED:Who?PRESIDENT:On the Mitchell thing (unintelligible) mustcome first...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...(tape noise) something today. We've gotto make this move today. If it fails, uh, just to get back on position, I think youought to talk to Magruder.HALDEMAN:I agree. PRESIDENT:And you tell Magruder, "Now Jeb, thisevidence is coming in, you ought to go intothe Grand Jury. Purge yourself if you're perjured, and tell this whole story."APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.80EHRLICHMAN:I agree.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible, with tape noise)PRESIDENT:The, we'll go -Bob, you don't agree withthat?HALDEMAN:Oh, I do.PRESIDENT:Because I think we do have to. Third, we'vegot the problemHALDEMAN:Maybe you should talk to Jeb first, though. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) John?EHRLICHMAN:Doesn't really matter, Bob, eh, eitherway...APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.81PRESIDENT: Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...who is ever coming first.PRESIDENT:But then, you see, you see the point is--HALDEMAN:For God's sake, then don't use Jeb as abasis for the conversation.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Say that the evidence is not Jeb.I'd just simply say that just a lot of other people with (unintelligible) Jeb...HALDEMAN:-although (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:...although he may blow (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:I can say, I can say that the the uh, uh,that I have, I have come to the conclusionthat it is both John and Jeb who are liablePRESIDENT: Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...and, uh-- PRESIDENT:But no, I meant...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, go ahead.PRESIDENT:I was going to say that we are not talkingto you, John, just because Jeb is going to crack...UNIDENTIFIED:Or that--PRESIDENT:...or that Dean is going to the Grand Jury.It's past that point. They've got the casemade.HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:He'll say, "well I think they're bluffinghere.&#64258; What'll you say?EHRLICHMAN:Uh, it isn't a question of bluffing. Uh,nobody's made any representations to us at all. Nobody's tried to bluff us...PRESIDENT: Right.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.82EHRLICHMAN:Uh, it, it's just a question of puttingtogether all the facts and that any timesomeone--if the U.S. Attorney's office goesthrough the process that " I&#8482;ve gone through, he&#8482;ll have all the facts. Andthere it'll be. And ya-, you don't get itall from any one person. It's it's some from this one, some from that one. It's a typical, it's a typical case, Bob.HALDEMAN: (Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:How does Dean's incidentally what is the,what is the, what is the liability or, uh,Hunt, or, uh--I'm thinking of the payoffthing...EHRLICHMAN: Yeah. PRESIDENT:...in this business,--somebody in, uh, Dean,Dean, uh,Dean asked, told me about theproblem of Hunt's lawyer, uh, wanted--had gotten--this was a few weeks ago--needed, uh, needed sixty thousand or forty thousanddollars or something like that. Youremember? He asked me about it and I said I, I don't know where you can get it. I said Iwould, uh, I mean, I frankly felt he mighttry to get it but I didn't know where. And then he left it up with Mitchell and Mitchell then said it was taken care of--amI correct? Is my recollection...EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. (unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Is that approximately correct?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, you could (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Did he talk to you about that? EHRLICHMAN:He talked to me about it. I said, John, Iwouldn't have the vaguest notion where toget it.PRESIDENT:Yeah-- EHRLICHMAN:I saw him later in the day. I saw Mitchelllater in the day...APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.83PRESIDENT: Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...Wednesday(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:What happened?EHRLICHMAN:And he just said it's taken care of. HALDEMAN:Mitchell raised the topic. He turned toDean and said, "what have you done about,uh, that other problem?&#64258; And Dean said--he kind of looked at us-and then said, "well, uh, you know, I, I don't know.&#64258; AndMitchell said, "Oh I guess that's been takencare of. (tape noise) said apparently through LaRue.PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(tape noise)LaRue. Where you the one whotold me?EHRLICHMAN:Who told you?HALDEMAN:...Oh, Dean told us. LaRue. He had, Deanhad a long talk with LaRue and LaRue said, "this whole thing is ridiculous now" and said (unintelligible, with tape noise) said,"yeah," he said, "If I were in charge ofthis now what I would do is I'd get a large bus and I'd put the President at the wheeland' I'd throw everybody we've got aroundhere in it and I'd drive up to the Senate and I'd have the President open the door and I'd say, you all get out and tell everythingyou know and I'll be back to pick you upwhen you're through.&#64258; He said, "It's all out now and there's nothing we can do aboutit." And he, he said, "I can," he said LaRuealso said, you know, I can't figure out how I got into this, uh, to begin with, but I, I, it seems to me all of us have been drawnin here in trying to cover up for John."PRESIDENT:For Mitchell? HALDEMAN:Yeah, which is exactly what's happened.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.84PRESIDENT:LaRue said that?HALDEMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:He's right. (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:And if LaRue is called, LaRue is,is--intends to tell the truth about it.PRESIDENT:Is he?HALDEMAN:Yeah. Now, I PRESIDENT:Well, what will be his defense... HALDEMAN:I don't know.PRESIDENT:...about obstruction?HALDEMAN:I don't know. EHRLICHMAN:I don't think he has one.HALDEMAN:If he doesn't intend--PRESIDENT:No, well, no.

That'sColson's main point because that's where itcomes from.EHRLICHMAN:That was the line.of communication-- PRESIDENT:Colson to Bittman? Well that's the onlything that we have on that, except Mitchell,apparently, had said something about clemency to people.HALDEMAN:To Liddy.PRESIDENT:And Mitchell has never, never disc--has heever discussed clemency with you, Bob?HALDEMAN:No. PRESIDENT:Has he ever discussed it with you?EHRLICHMAN:No.PRESIDENT:Needless to say, not with me.

But he'snever said, "Look you're gonna get a pardonfor these people when this is over.&#64258; Neverused any such language around here, has he, John?EHRLICHMAN:Not to me.HALDEMAN:I don't think so.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.89PRESIDENT:With Dean has he?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I don't know.HALDEMAN:That's a question (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:'Cause Dean's never raised it. In fact,Dean told me an interesting thing I said,Dean I said, "John," I said, uh, where's itall lead?&#64258; He said, "uh." I said "what's it going to cost? Now you could continue this of course.&#64258; He said about a milliondollars. I said facetiously, "Have youthought of this at all?&#64258; (Unintelligible) That's the point.

That's the point. Now where the hell to you get the money for that?&#64258;That's the reason this whole thing falls. Imean, uh,uh, it's, it's that, that, I mean, uh, that aston&#177;shes me about Mitchell and the rest.EHRLICHMAN:Improbable.PRESIDENT:Not only improbable, there's no way to getthe money is there?

One finalthing: Dean. You, you don't think we haveto bite it today?EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'm not so sure. Uh, I'd, I'd beinclined-say you are (unintelligible). Whenyou say bite it it's simply a matter ot making a decision, in, in my opinion, uhPRESIDENT:Well, I've made a decision. I think he hasto go.EHRLICHMAN:Well, I'm not sure that's the rightdecision. It's uh, uh, uh, by, by framingthe issue, I;:.doh`t mean to imply that...PRESIDENT:Oh, I see. EHRLICHMAN:...that's the (unintelligible). PRESIDENT:I thought, no, no, I thought...EHRLICHMAN:Uh, (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:When, when you said you didn't address it,I, I'm sorry, I thought that was one of the recommendations you had made.EHRLICHMAN:No, no, my recommendation is that yourecognize that, there's a go-no go decision that has to be...PRESIDENT:Oh, I see.EHRLICHMAN:...made right away. PRESIDENT:Oh, alright, yeah. EHRLICHMAN:You see, here's your situation as I--Lookagain-the big picture--You now are possessedof a,body of fact.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And you've got to, you can't just sit here.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.92PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:You've got to act on it.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...You've got to make some, you got to makesome decisions and the Dean thing is one ofthe decisions that you have to make. Now you may decidePRESIDENT:[on telephone] Bull, please. Steve Bull. [ToEhrlichman] (unintelligible) Alright, fine,John.EHRLICHMAN:Eh, eh--PRESIDENT:...Then you're not...EHRLICHMAN:Then you've got to dispose of it one way orthe other. Uh, uh, there may be and, and, I'm,I&#8482;m--(Phone rings)[on telephone]PRESIDENT:Yeah, put the, uh, that, uh, thing with, uh,uh, Haig, uh, back. What time you got now?Quarter after (Hangs I'll be there a fewminutes late at the EOB.[Hangs up telephone]EHRLICHMAN:I'll tell you, I am still heavilypersuaded,"that we affect the Grand Jury andU.S. Attorney,treatment of Dean favorably bykeeping him on.PRESIDENT:Okay.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, and that that's important. Now--PRESIDENT:Why, why, do you say that? Because they likehim?EHRLICHMAN:No, no, not at all.HALDEMAN:Because they can treat him differently as thePresident's counsel than--EHRLICHMAN:As the dismissed President's counselHALDEMAN:Exactly.PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.93EHRLICHMAN:it's just that it's a very heavypsychological factor.PRESIDENT:Well, this will be done, because there isanother reason? too. It isn't like, it--Dean is not like Mitchell, now let'sface it.HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Dean is not like Mitchell in the sense thatDean only tried to do what he could to pickup the Goddamn pieces and...HALDEMAN:Certainly. PRESIDENT:...everybody else around here knew it had tobe done.EHRLICHMAN:Certainly. PRESIDENT:Uh, let's face it. I'm not blaming anybodyelse how.HALDEMAN:I understand.PRESIDENT:That was his job. HALDEMAN:I understand. EHRLICHMAN:I have, I have great trouble in(unintelligible) that you could be involvedin the light of the known involvement that he had...PRESIDENT:After the?EHRLICHMAN:...in the aftermath. PRESIDENT:Right, but-- EHRLICHMAN:But--HALDEMAN:The known involvement in the aftermath wasfor, uh, what was understood here to be the proper (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:That's half--PRESIDENT:The question is motive. HALDEMAN:That's right.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.94EHRLICHMAN:That's number one. Number two, there isnothing new about that.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:As I have developed, in this thing--I'd likeyou to read this.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:There were eight or ten people around herewho knew about this, knew it was going on.PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Bob knew, I knew, all kinds of people knew.PRESIDENT:Well, I knew it. I knew it. EHRLICHMAN:And it was not a question of whether--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I knew I must say though, Ididn't know it, but I must have assumed it though, but you know, fortunately--and I thank you both for arranging it that way andit does show why the isolation of thePresident, isn't a a bad position to be in.EHRLICHMAN:(Laughs) PRESIDENT:But the first time that I knew that they hadto have the money was the time when, uh,Dean told me that they needed forty thousand dollars. I hadn't been rege-, I didn't, Ijust didn't, I closed my eyes, I couldn'tread the Goddamn papers on those little envelopes. I didn't know about the envelopes and the (uninte2144ible) and allthat stuff.EHRLICHMAN:Well, the, the... PRESIDENT:But others did know.EHRLICHMAN:...the point is that, that if Dean's, if thewrongdoing which justifies Dean's dismissal is his knowledge that that operation was going on...APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.95PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...then you can't stop with him. You've gotto go through the whole place wholesale.PRESIDENT:Fire the whole staff, EHRLICHMAN:That's right. It's, it's a question ofmotive. It's a question of role, and I don'tthink Dean's role in the aftermath, at least from the facts that I know now, achieves a level of wrongdoing that requires that youterminate him.PRESIDENT:Nah. EHRLICHMAN:...And, and, that, and this other thingPRESIDENT:I think you've made a very powerful point tome that, that -of course, you can be pragmatic and say, "Well, Christ, in fact Dean" and so forth -inother words cutyour losses and get rid of 'em. I mean,give 'em an hors d'oeuvre and maybethey won't come back for the main course. Go out, John Dean. On the other hand, uh, it istrue others did know, they did know.EHRLICHMAN:But more than that -we've made Dean a focalpoint in the Gray processPRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...And he will become a focal point in theErvin process.PRESIDENT:Well, we'll have -yes, except ifHALDEMAN:Yeah, if, if goes on.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:And if you dismiss him he'll still be afocal point.EHRLICHMAN:He'll be a focal point. (Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:He'll be a defrocked -with a less, with lessprotection, that's right.EHRLICHMAN:And with less incentive.PRESIDENT:Well, the point that I think, I think Dean--APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.96PRESIDENT:Dean's--HALDEMAN:What Dean did was all proper...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...in terms of the higher good. PRESIDENT:Dean--you've gotta have a talked with Dean.I feel that I should not talked to him.EHRLICHMAN:I have talk to him. PRESIDENT:But--I mean about motives. EHRLICHMAN:I have talked to him.PRESIDENT:What's he say about motives? He says it washush up?EHRLICHMAN:No. He says he knew, he, he had to knowthat people were, uh, trying to bring thatresult about...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...and he says, you know, the way I got intothis was I would go to meetings in, in...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...campaign headquarters, uh, and, uh,uh,we'd get through the meeting and uh,Mitchell and LaRue would say to, to, uh,uh,I mean Mardian and LaRue.would say to Mitchell, "Mitch, you've got to do somethingabout this.&#64258; And Mitchell's stock answerwas to turn to John Dean.HALDEMAN:Say what are you gonna do? EHRLICHMAN:"What are you going to do?"PRESIDENT:Jesus Christ.EHRLICHMAN:And, uh, so John said, I got to be a kindof, kind of a water carrier. I'd come backfrom those meetings and I'd come in to seeBob, or me or somebody else...APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.97PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...and say well, Mitchell's got this bigproblem. And then he'd say they'd say tome, well I don't know what I'll do about it.PRESIDENT:When he came in to see Bob and you whatwould he say was the problem?EHRLICHMAN:Uh, held say, these, these guys, uh,uh,Hunt's getting, uh, jittery and, uh, and says that he's got to have umpty-umpthousand dollars, and uh, Mitchell'sterribly worried about it, and uh, uh-it, it was never expressed, but it was certainlyunderstood...PRESIDENT:Okay, on the question of motive then,though, (unintelligible) those conversations to keep up (unintelligible) that motive wasnever discussed.EHRLICHMAN:Never discussed with me in those terms. PRESIDENT:Right? UNIDENTIFIED:Uh, right.PRESIDENT:The motive was to help defendants who were,by golly, who had worked for the...EHRLICHMAN:Well...PRESIDENT:...campaign committee--EHRLICHMAN:...it never really got that far because, uh,we uh, at least my, my conversation with John always was, well, you know that's,that's interesting--I just don't know whatto do for you."PRESIDENT:Yeah. And, he may have gone further withyou, Bob Did he?HALDEMAN:No. EHRLICHMAN:He, we referred him to Kalmbach. HALDEMAN:You aimed him at Kalmbach.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.98HALDEMAN:I aimed him at Mitchell. I said, "John youcan't come here and ask for help, we don'thave any."PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:The one thing where it did go further, ifyou want to argue about it, it was in thesense that th-, the 350...PRESIDENT:At the end-- HALDEMAN:...which was not our money, we did move backover there.PRESIDENT:For this purpose? EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) what it was.HALDEMAN:Yeah, yeah.PRESIDENT:Who asked for it? HALDEMAN:Nobody. PRESIDENT:I mean, eh, how did, who...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) asked for that.PRESIDENT:...who took the move on the 350? HALDEMAN:I did. PRESIDENT:How did you know that (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Gordon Strachan...PRESIDENT:...came to you? HALDEMAN:...Gordon Strachan came to me after theelection and said you have three hundred andfifty thousand...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...dollars in cash...PRESIDENT:oh...HALDEMAN:...What do you want to do with it...APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.99PRESIDENT:...this was not requested by LaRue?HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:or Gordon?HALDEMAN:No, the problem was getting them to take itback. They wouldn't take it.EHRLICHMAN:'Cause they didn't know how to(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:That money... HALDEMAN:'Cause LaRue didn't know what to do(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:...that, that money-- HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) let him take it. LaRuewanted it...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...but Mitchell wouldn't let him take it. PRESIDENT:Oh.EHRLICHMAN:They just didn't know how to account for it.PRESIDENT:Well, just frankly, he wouldn't have toaccount for it, in my opinion.HALDEMAN:Well, but he didn't, he, he was--PRESIDENT:1970 money, for Christ's sakes.HALDEMAN:(Clears throat) He said I have to accountfor it now because he's--Fred LaRue is inpersonal receipt.after Grand Jury knowledgeof three hundred and twentyeight thousand dollars in cash delivered to him at night at his apartment by Gordon Strachan. Keywitnesses to that transaction are Strachanand LaRue.PRESIDENT:LaRue tells you, huh?HALDEMAN:And Strachan just testified that that's whathappened. Well, LaRue's got a problem. What did he do with it? At that point, it's income to him. He's got an IRS problem ifhe can't get it, get it--it's unaccounted.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.100PRESIDENT:He'll use it, what, what does he say? He saysI used it for hush money?HALDEMAN:I don't know what he'll say. He'll probably(tape noise) packaged it upPRESIDENT:Does that help any? That certainly doesn'thelp us.HALDEMAN:Doesn't help anybody, but, uh, but, uh, youknow--PRESIDENT:The other thing he says, "Well I just, I, I'veretained it in a fund for future campaigns."HALDEMAN:No, can't show it, doesn't have it. I'm surehe doesn't have it.EHRLICHMAN:I don't, I'm not sure either, but I assumethat it went right out to, to pay thesepeople, I, uh, that's, that's my assumption.(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Now Dean says this. He says we have only twopro blems with the aftermath in the WhiteHouse. One is the fact that we made areferral to Kalmbach, but he said that can beexplained. And, that's, that's no majorproblem. The other is the $350,000 and that can be explained and need not be a majorproblem if it's clearly explained. And wehave no, no problem with the aftermath.HALDEMAN:I'm running the three-fifty into my statement,but the question of whether we want it in.PRESIDENT:Oh, yes, Put it in there.HALDEMAN:Nobody knows about it--that's anotherbombshell.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I think it's been, there'sbeen something written about it.HALDEMAN:Well but, yeah, but not that I had it.EHRLICHMAN:It is eleven o'clock.PRESIDENT:All right. Eleven o'clock, that's when thearmistice was signed, so off we go.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.101EHRLICHMAN:Uh, Mitchell is roughly two hours away at,at best. I couldPRESIDENT:I think he's going to come down and do ittoday. I think--what--Bob, I think you have to go out and call him, now. And, uh, askhim if he can come down.EHRLICHMAN:We'll send an airplane for him. HALDEMAN:That'll take longer than his coming(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:And by the time we get a plane mobilized andup there, it takes longer. We'll send it(tape noise) play golf or something.PRESIDENT:I know, I know. He may be gone. But thepoint that I make is this, if, if he's out to play golf, we say we have, uh, we, we,have an urgent message for him and we saythere've been some (tape noise) there have been some (unintelligible with tape.noise) on the Watergate thing.HALDEMAN:And that hurry and come immediately.PRESIDENT:(Tape noise) should come down. EHRLICHMAN:I think Bob's right.PRESIDENT:Okay. Can you come down? If he says I can'tcome, then Ehrlichman should go upHALDEMAN:Then say to him well, John will come up.Where can you be rePRESIDENT:Yes. If he says well I've got a dinnertonight and I've got that, uh, say John.-I mean this is the thing--John, this is veryimportant. The President considers this ofthe highest urgency that you be aware of these developments. How's that sound to you?UNIDENTIFIED:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Something that just can't be postponed anylonger.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.102PRESIDENT:Can't be postponed and, uh, we, uh, have aproblem.(Walking noise)Harder than firing Hickel.EHRLICHMAN:Oh, about the same.PRESIDENT:Eleven?HALDEMAN(?):Yes, sir.[Haldeman leaves, Ehrlichman dialstelephone]EHRLICHMAN:Call me?

I hadn't knownreally what, what's been bothering me thisweek...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:...But what's been bothering me is--PRESIDENT:That with knowledge, we're still not doinganything.EHRLICHMAN:That's right. That's exactly right. PRESIDENT:The law and order--Goddamn it, that's theway I am. I, you know, it is a pain for meto do anything. The Mitchell thing is Goddamn painful.(Unintelligible with noise)[Haldeman enters room]PRESIDENT:Is he coming?

It's just,it comes under this whole heading of havingknowledge and having to act on it.PRESIDENT:Well, my point is that I think that youbetter see Magruder before you see him. No,no I guess you'llEHRLICHMAN:It doesn't matter, in my opinion. PRESIDENT:You should see Magruder today. That's themain thing.EHRLICHMAN:I think we ought to make a similar call toMagruder.HALDEMAN:I think the way to do it then--I should callJeb...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...and say that things have developed andall this and, and, uhPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:I didn't say that to Mitchell.EHRLICHMAN:It doesn't matter.PRESIDENT:Oh, Mitchell, he knows better. (Tape noise)gotta ,say that to Jeb.HALDEMAN:Well, I tell you, when I--the thing is whenI say it to Jeb, it'll take probably thirty-seven seconds for him to turn up on your doorstep.EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's alright.PRESIDENT:That's alright. EHRLICHMAN:It won't--PRESIDENT:I think we should do it before you seeMitchell. Or you, do you feel uncomfortable about telling him?APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.105EHRLICHMAN:No. As I say, I, I think it's almost immaterial asto which I see first. It's the fact of doing itrather than any particular sequence.PRESIDENT:Well-- HALDEMAN:Mitchell won't be here, he can't be here 'til... PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:I think, in my view, in my view, John, you can'twait to act. I think you should see Jeb Magruderand say now Jab, you're to testify.(unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:I wouldn't quite say it that way. I'll say, Idon't know if you know what I've been doing here, the last three weeks. I have been ranging over this whole subject matter trying to bring to the President something more than John Dean has charged.PRESIDENT:Can you--tell him as you talk to him that what hesays is attorney-client or no? You can't tell him. Okay.EHRLICHMAN:I, I, I'll simply say that, as, as you know Deandid an investigation which determined whether or nor the White House was involved. My responsibility was greater than that. It was to range over the whole thing and try and bring to thePresident a new (tape noise) of information on whatactually happened, (tape noise) uh, uh, version of what transpired. And from what I have been able to put together, I have advised the President and he has--this morning-and he has directed me immediately to contact you (tape noise) uh, uh, having accepted a point of view in all of this (tape noise) people should not dis close what they know, because it somehow serves the President.(Tape noise) apparently, considerable criminaljeopardy. (Tape noise) what to do from your own standpoint. What I want you to have is the message from the President. (Tape noise) in any way view it as serving his-interests for you to remainsilent. Decide what to do from your own personal standpoint and (unintelligible) any right to interfere in that decision. if there-ever was animpediment to your coming forward by reason of yourimpression of, uh, uh, assumed or otherwise, of what the President wanted you to do I think it's my job...APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.106PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:...to impart to you what is actually the case. PRESIDENT:I would, also, though I'd put a couple of gracenotes in and say, Jeb, let me just start here by telling you the President's own great affection for you and for your family--real affection--mymind was thinking last night of his poor littlekids in school...HALDEMAN:Yeah, beautiful kids. PRESIDENT:...and his lovely wife and all the rest. Andjust, just put--it breaks your heart. And say this, this, is a very painful message forme--for,for him to-I, I've been asked to giveyou, but, but, but I must do it and that's that. Let's put it right out that way. And also--I'd just put that in so that he knows that I have personal affection. That's the way to, that's the way the so-called clemency's got to be handled. Do you see, John?EHRLICHMAN:I understand.HALDEMAN:Do the same thing with Mitchell. PRESIDENT:Yeah--oh, Mitchell? Well, you could say toMitchell, I think you've got to say...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:...you&#8482;re got to say that this is the toughestdecision he's made. It's tougher than Cambodia,May 8th and December 18th put together. And that he, uh, just can't bring himself to talk to you about it. Just can't do it. And he's directed that I talk to you. Frankly, what I am doing, John, is putting you in the same positionas President Eisenhower put me in with Adams(unintelligible) But John Mitchell, let me say, will never go to prison. I agree with that assumption. I think what will happen is that he will put on the Goddamnedest defense that--the point, you have, your suggestion is gonna be henot put on a defense. You're suggesting he goin and say look I am responsible here. I had no knowledge but I am responsible. And uh, I uh, I, and nobody else had, and uh, that's it. I myself. That's it. And I want to plead, uh, this, this has got to stop--innocent people are being smeared in this thing.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.107EHRLICHMAN:He will understand...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:...that once you are possessed of a reasonablebody of knowledge, (unintelligible) you havean obligation to do something and, rather thansimply to turn it over to the U.S. Attorney, the thing that you are doing, in the firstinstance is giving him an opportunity to comeforward.PRESIDENT:Or, rather than having a special prosecutor,say that he comes a special prosecutor. ThePresident rejects that. Uh, the idea that,uh, we turn it over to the U.S. Attorney, call him in, which I could do, and uh, or callin the Attorney General which I could do, butI think.it's--obligations to do, do thisbecuase I cannot have this. Now, of course,he's going to ask, well, now John whatknowledge do you really have except hearsay.Answer.EHRLICHMAN:I don't have any knowledge except hearsay,John, uh, butPRESIDENT:But I do know that Magruder---EHRLICHMAN:...in other words, I don't have, I don't havedocuments and I...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)Events are moving veryspeedily...EHRLICHMAN:...but, but...PRESIDENT:There is no question-about-what is going tohappen.EHRLICHMAN:...there can be--that's right. That's right.Tha-, tha-, thatHALDEMAN:You won't have to appeal to him on thatbecause he's made the point, you know, that ifDean testifies, it's going to unscramble thewhole-omelet.PRESIDENT:Well, I'm sorry--I don't want to leave it atthe point that Dean's or Magruder's testimony is essential to Mitchell(unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:That's right. That's right.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.108PRESIDENT:You see that's the point of that. On the Deanthing I, I wouldn't say that the President hasstood, frankly, John, on, on the executiveprivilege thing, (unintelligible) and soforth.EHRLICHMAN:It, it, it isn't my purpose to prove to yoursatisfaction your guilt or that you're goingto be indicted, but-HALDEMAN:It's my purpose to say that the President nowis in possessionPRESIDENT:That I believe you should come-What are yougoing to suggest that he do, John?EHRLICHMAN:Well, if he asks me, what do you want me todo? I am going to say I if, if you would dowhat I ask you, what I would suggest, youwould pick up the phone or you would allow meto pick it up and call Earl Silbert and makean appointment today, and go over, and talkwith the U.S. Attorney about this case, withcounsel.PRESIDENT:"I'll see the President and tell him you'regoing to do it.EHRLICHMAN:No.PRESIDENT:Okay.EHRLICHMAN:Uh, well you're asking me in effect to go downand enter a guilty plea. And I would say,look John, you're the only one who knows thebasic (unintelligible) and to decide whetherthere's any room between what you know and the ultimate action of the jury through which youmight pass unpunished. I can't make thatjudgment for you and I don't have any right tomake it for you. All I'm saying is thatyou're looking at this thing from thestandpoint of the Presidency. Today isprobably the last day that you can take thataction, if you're ever going to take it. Uh,do the President a bit of good.PRESIDENT:&#64257;Do you realize John, uh, that uh, that uh,that uh, uh,uh, (tape noise) on the WhiteHouse? I mean Colson, maybe Haldeman, aregoing to get involved in this thing too."APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.109EHRLICHMAN:Well, here again, we're looking at this thingnot from the standpoint of any otherindividual. We're looking at it from thestandpoint of the Presidency and that's theonly way I think you and I can approach this.PRESIDENT:And I'd, I'd go further and say the Presidenthas said let the chips fall where they may.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:We are not gonna cover for anybody. I thinkyou ought to say that.EHRLICHMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Don't you agree, Bob? That isn't it? We've a--HALDEMAN:He may go, he may get Chuck. He may get you(unintelligible) to ask him to do(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) on the whole House.1-'Fine.But we on the other hand, have to do somethingelse. Fine. I think he would take thelatter. He thinksHALDEMAN:He thinks (unintelligible) and that's thething we've worried about all along, haven'twe. That's uh, if somebody gets hit what will we do. But we can't worry about what we willdo if he does anything. We'll have to dealwith that. It's gonna expire.EHRLICHMAN:And this is one that will permit him--and itmight help the Presidency, rather than damageit.PRESIDENT:Uh, Bob, do you think there's something to besaid for having John wait to talk to Magruderuntil after he's seen Mitchell? (Tape noise)something. Suppose you get stonewalled withMitchell.HALDEMAN:Well, I think John's in a stronger position ifhe's talked to Magruder than if he hasn't, butI, maybe,EHRLICHMAN:I tell you, it is not what Mitchell says thatmatters today. It is the fact that you have acted on information today.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.110PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Now, let's suppose Mitchell turns us downcold, and says I'm going to preserve all myrights. I'm going to make, uh, fight every inch of turf and so on and so forth. Okay.That's that, alright. But at least you,having accumulated all this knowledge this week, have tried to get this thing out, so that sometime two months from now, threemonths from now, a year from now whenthere's an accounting, you can say, "on the 14th of AprilPRESIDENT:It's the 13th.EHRLICHMAN:It's where? Uh, on the 14th day or the 14th? PRESIDENT:This is the l4th, yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, we had Friday the 13th yesterday.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) the 13th.EHRLICHMAN:On, on the 14th... PRESIDENT:No, seriously (unintelligible) as I havetold both of you, the boil had to bepricked. That's--in a very differentsense--that's what December 18th was about. We have to prick the Goddamn boil and takethe heat. Now that's what we are doing here.We&#8482;re going to prick this boil and take the heat. Am I, am I overstating?HALDEMAN: No.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:No, I think that's right. And uh,(unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:The history of this--HALDEMAN:...and this will prick the boil. PRESIDENT:Yeah.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.111HALDEMAN:It may not.EHRLICHMAN:The history of this thing has to be, though,that you did not tuck this under the rug...PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:...yesterday or today, and hope it would goaway.PRESIDENT:Now, uh, let me give the scenario -uh hasEhrlichman go out and tell people that I have done this.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. It depends on how it allturns out. If he does not go to the U.S. Attorney 0PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...if Magruder decides to stay clammed up PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:Then what'd you do?EHRLICHMAN:...then I'd take, uh--PRESIDENT:Well, let's... HALDEMAN:Would you do it again? PRESIDENT:...let's suppose, let's suppose, let'ssuppose they still indict. You don't wantthem to indict and then have to say that on s-, on, on s-, on Saturday, the 14th ofApril, that you, John Ehrlichman--APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.112HALDEMAN:Yeah, but you see yeah, but you see--EHRLICHMAN:The problem there isHALDEMAN:...do you support the PresidentEHRLICHMAN:...these things, at least you've got therecord --HALDEMAN:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:The problem is that if you were to go out onthis kind of hearsay and say we know who did it, then you've prejudiced their rights,the, the, uh --PRESIDENT:Then your, then your thought is to get outbeforehand.EHRLICHMAN:No, no, not at all.PRESIDENT:Your thought is, just to make a record ofthe (unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:When somebody comes to uh, uh(unintelligible) indictments, what the hellwas the White House doing all this time? Then you're in a position to say well, we began to investi gate personally and, andthe external cir cumstances and we came tosome conclusions and we acted on those conclusions.PRESIDENT:John Ehrlichman conducted an investigationfor the President.EHRLICHMAN:And we made un-- PRESIDENT:John Ehrlichman's -uh, now the 13th of -uh--EHRLICHMAN:It may be that what should happen here isthat if they both stonewall, I ought to sitdown with Silbert and just say now I don'thave a lot of evidence...PRESIDENT:I agree with that. I agree with that.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.113EHRLICHMAN:...but I have an accumulation of hearsayPRESIDENT:And the President wants you to go forward onthis.EHRLICHMAN:And I'll turn over to you that... PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:...the report that I made for the President,for whatever it's worth. And I want to tell you that I had con-, uh, had contact with two of your targets to make clear to themnobody in the White House wanted them in anyway to be reticent. Beyond that, I don't have anything to say to you.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:Well HALDEMAN:See what happens. EHRLICHMAN:Let's, let's see what these guys go. But,uh, uh, I think maybe like tomorrow I oughtto see Silbert.PRESIDENT:I agree. I think the record should be madewe have talked to him so that he knows thatthe President has moved on this(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:And that's, a, that, that, puts a th-, uh,uh--PRESIDENT:And that we saw the U.S. Attorney andturned over our information to him. All the information we had.EHRLICHMAN:I would like a record of my conversationwith both Magruder and Mitchell. I personally think that maybe I ought to getmy office geared up so that I can do that.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.114PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) here, or do you remove thatequipment?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) my meetings with Henry, butI don't know.EHRLICHMAN:I, I think it's better if I do it overthere.PRESIDENT:Why don't you just gear it up and, uh, youcan, do you know, do you have a way to gearit up?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. I've done it before. PRESIDENT:Well, go gear it.EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:No, no, no, no, no, Well, wait a minute. No,I think that's too...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:. . . too little. I would just, I wouldjust have it so that you'll know that, uh -what we'ev got here. I don't want to hear the record, let me say. (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Raise a question and I don't know if it's agood idea or not but does it serve any pur pose for me to sit in on the meeting?EHRLICHMAN:I think you should come.HALDEMAN:That's, maybe that's PRESIDENT:Or -- HALDEMAN:...it's -that would give you a witness, forone thing, If either of those people werequestioned and you (tape noise unintelligible) anybody else in, you've gota problem.APRIL 14, 1973, FROM 8:55 TO 11:31 A.M.115PRESIDENT:And then when Mitchell says, Bob, you know,you were in this too. What's Bob Haldemansay?EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) well he won't. He won't. PRESIDENT:I think Bob should sit in...EHRLICHMAN:That's good.PRESIDENT:because Haldeman is, uh EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:No, no. I think so. That gives you thewitness. And also...EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Mitchell feels he's got a friend there. Andhe knows that you're not just doing this onyour own, freewheeling it. Bob says we talked it all over. The President said we can't sit on information that's(unintelligible) of this nature.(Unintelligible) information from the members of the White House staff, it's gonna be exactly the same procedure. I think weought to move on the Jeb thing, Bob.HALDEMAN:We'll get him in my office. PRESIDENT:of course, and give your report to me on,uh, as soon as you finish your conversationwith Jeb...UNIDENTIFIED:Okay. PRESIDENT:...I'll be (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Incidentally--
