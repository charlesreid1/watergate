Has anybodyeven heard?HALDEMAN:No. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Well Gray, you know what Imean, all this, this stuff where, uh, uh,where, uh, Gray is saying he took(unintelligible). Who is, who is advising him on it?HALDEMAN:I haven't any idea. If it's not--accordingto Dean, it would be John if anybodyPRESIDENT:No. No. No. HALDEMAN:...According to Dean.PRESIDENT:Bet Gray doesn't want any advice.HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Well, that's fine. But who is in touch withGray?HALDEMAN:But nobody is. Gray keeps in touch withEhrlichman and calls him after his, his day, and tells him what a great job he did,...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...what his real strategy is, and, uh, hedoesn't want or take any advice. The, uh-- you talked to Kleindienst, uh, way back inthe beginning of the, of the thing, and atthat point when you told Ehrlichman and me to basically not to get into that stuff,which we haven't, except that Gray doescheck with John, uh (unintelligible).MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.2PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:I don't know if he's checked with Dean ornot. I don't, I don't know whether Dean is,is trying to counsel him, which he can't.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:If Dean can't, and, uh, I think that, uh,we've just got a loose gun that, uh, rolls back and forth on the deck there, and--PRESIDENT:Well, of course, I suppose nobody's gonna,it, uh, I see, there's so many obviousthings, but, I mean, you know. Gray should not be on the defensive at all with regardto furnishing information to the WhiteHouse.HALDEMAN:Well, of course, he shouldn't, I mean... PRESIDENT:He should...HALDEMAN:...(Unintelligible) he for God's sakes hasnot been.PRESIDENT:...he should be in, he should say,"Senators, you (unintelligible) as Directorof the FBI. It's always been our tradition,under this guidelines, the President laid out, to furnish information to(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) say when I talk to him? PRESIDENT:Yeah. See, what--that puts it, the FB-, thelawyer in him across.HALDEMAN:The point is...PRESIDENT:There isn't any question about that, and asfar as the White House is concerned, well ofcourse, the White House has had directaccess to the FBI. We have to, we make checks. Dean's the guy that does all the checking on every, everything that comes uplegally. That's what I mean. I, I waswondering--MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.3HALDEMAN:He, he has to, well, that's the positionGray has taken. That's (unintelligible) andhe's taking it pretty strongly. He's justgotten 'em all, that's what they're, what they're (unintelligible). He takes ittoo...PRESIDENT:...strongly. HALDEMAN:too strongly. PRESIDENT:Well, I had...HALDEMAN:I think it means--PRESIDENT:I don't mean, I don't mean, Bob, he's takingthe position strongly in furnishing it tous, but just put it on the other side.HALDEMAN:Put the Congress into it-- PRESIDENT:That's the point. HALDEMAN:That's the problem. He can only do that .toa degree. You see, Gray won't, won't,apparently won't...PRESIDENT:Program. HALDEMAN:...sort of fudge anything, you know, or fuzzanything, he has to do it all in, inthese...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...damn precise, uh...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...precise terms, and PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:and as--PRESIDENT:Right. Okey, Bob. I suppose there's noreason to --well, I don't want to call--MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.4HALDEMAN:There may be, it, it, they--PRESIDENT:We got an interesting, uh--Colson had, uh, toldme that he wanted to talk with, uh, Baker's administrative assistant, in talking in conversation on this thing, where he showed us what (unintelligible) When I talked to Baker,for example, he said he did not want to talk toanybody at the White House, he did not want to talk to Dean. He said--I, I said, "Who do you want to talk to?&#64258; He says, "I'll talk to Kleindienst.&#64258; You may recall I told you that.HALDEMAN:Yeah, I--PRESIDENT:I told them. Now (laughs), uh, Colson comes inwith, uh--I don't know whether this is, uh, how much of this is Colson, how much is the administrative, the administrative assistant of Baker's. I heard that he felt that he wanted to be, be helpful to the White House. He doesn't want to get out on the wrong side of this thing.He wants the President to know that, but hedoesn't feel that he has anybody to talk to here and so forth.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:And, I said, "Nobody.&#64258; I said, "I told youthat, I didn't want to talk to anybody&#64258; I said,&#64257;You should talk to Kleindienst&#64258;, and, ofcourse, he said, "Well, now Colson sort of (unintelligible) Colson work something out (unintelligible). "Well, that can't be. Uh, what I'm getting at is that somebody is pulling somebody's leg here. Uh, what the, what(unintelligible). I recall that Baker said hedidn't, uh, uh, know about this (unintelligible). The whole point is this, you have at the present time, Bob, a situation where, uh, where--I don't know what--like with Colson. I, that's why I only raised the Grayquestion tangentially. The question is, what inthe hell is Kleindienst (unintelligible) handle Gray. Uh, see what I mean? If we, if it isn't done from here, we haven't got anybody to steer him toward it, then there must be somebody else that can do it. 'Cause otherwise you do have a loose cannon on the deck.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.5HALDEMAN:Uh, I don't know. The jury's(unintelligible). When you met withKleindienst, nobody else was there, wasthere? Was there anyone from the White House there?PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:The, the, but there was nothing--the, withKleindienst there was no problem.PRESIDENT:Well--HALDEMAN:There's gotta be a problem when Kleindiensttalks to you. The problem is what happens afterwards.PRESIDENT:Well, the point was, (unintelligible)Kleindienst was clear. I said, I said "Baker came in to see me, he wants to talk to you.&#64258; I have already reported on this,you know that...HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...he said, that Klein--that, that,Kleindienst said that, that he was waitingfor Baker and Ervin to come down to see him,but it's his, his ball.HALDEMAN:You see my point?PRESIDENT:Yeah. I, I said, now, I said, Baker wantsto talk to you.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) and I talk to Kleindienstthen and, and raise some questions?PRESIDENT:I think you should.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:I think somebody has to.HALDEMAN:Maybe it'd be better get...PRESIDENT:I guess I could call him in, but God damnit, I don't...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.6HALDEMAN:No question you have to ride herd on thisthing.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Alright. The point is thatKleindienst, I mean, uh, Baker is now, uh--'cause according to Colson, and I'm notsure of this either, (unintelligible) thatBaker's administrative assistant says that,.that he heard that Baker didn't want to talk to Kleindienst; well God-damn itthat's who Baker said he wanted to talk to,and they didn't want to talk to anybody at the White House. But anyway,-uh, on, onboth Gray and Dea-, and, and,Baker, it seemsto me, Bob, that Kleindienst has gotta pick up the labor more,here, if, uh, he's not going to talk with somebody else.HALDEMAN:Why not?PRESIDENT:Why not, and ask him who else, 'causeKleindienst told him that he thinks the White House shouldn't get into these things'blind. Alright, take the, take them and getgoing. I was. thinking I might call him in.HALDEMAN:In that respect, it occurred to me that--PRESIDENT:Today, you finish your meeting that, uh, andyou could, you could, well you could have a bite of lunch, and then I could, uh, I couldmeet with you at about, uh, 1:30.HALDEMAN:You mean with the-, with the group? PRESIDENT:Or maybe with Mitchell and, uh, you know,however, uh, whatever you want. Uh, butmaybe Mitchell, uh, Mitchell would just want to have Dean in it at this point. Uh, Dean could be picked up. I wouldn't want itlarger than that. I wouldn't want to bringMoore in and all that but, but, uh, well, while Mitchell is here, I should see him. Iwas so near meetingMARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.7PRESIDENT CONT:with Dick, we had planned to meet during themorning (unintelligible) and why don't youhave a bite of lunch. But, you see, Igotta, I gotta be working right through lunch today in order to get(unintelligible). But I, I can be free by1:30. How does that sould to you, then?HALDEMAN:Okay. Perfect PRESIDENT:Then I should have a meeting--HALDEMAN:Right. Unless John has to go back, but Idon't think he does. ,PRESIDENT:Well, let me put it this way, who should,---if he, before he goes back, I ought to seeJohn. I want to be sure that he--HALDEMAN:No, I think PRESIDENT:I'm put-, I'm putting the heat right on him.Okay.HALDEMAN:You're putting the heat on him. You couldmake the--well, I guess the best (unintelligible) cover up the funds. Well--PRESIDENT:You both have influence with those^(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). It wouldn't hurt for youto express to Mitchell some concern thatKleindienst doesn't seem to be stepping up and running things here. That--you could very well get it back today.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:And, see, coming from Mitchell from you, hasmore--The problem we've got when it comesfrom any of usPRESIDENT:I know. HALDEMAN:...is that, that... PRESIDENT:The White House.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.8HALDEMAN:...they read it that the White House, well,and, that, you know, we&#8482;re trying to coverour own tracks, get them trapped into it andall this kind of crap.PRESIDENT:Well, I&#8482;ll get Kleindienst over if that&#8482;sthe thing to do, understand. Don&#8482;t worryabout it; my problem. I&#8482;ll do everything I can, but I, I said before, I thought he was going to work on it.(Pause)HALDEMAN:Hasn&#8482;t had a track record of doing-- PRESIDENT:Of following through on this kind of stuff.Well, (unintelligible) got a good trackrecord of following through, believe me.HALDEMAN:You sure do. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I pass on, if you wouldpass this Baker thing on. It, uh, I thinkthat you probably have to get, uh, keep, uh, Colson a step removed from as (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) Why they...PRESIDENT:Well, why they could, uh&#352;understand&#352;let mesay, this was apparently, uh, Colson saidthat it was their&#352;he didn&#8482;t ask to see thefellow, the guy asked to see him, which seems to me very, very curious that, uh, Baker&#8482;s administrative assistant would gosee Colson. I don&#8482;t know what in the hellthat&#8482;s all about. It may be because of Webster&#8482;s influence on that fact, but Idon&#8482;t know. But, the point is that it'sridiculous that, uh, Baker&#8482;s wanting to have a contact. He doesn't ind-what&#8482;d he say, he didn't want to see anybody at the WhiteHouse. I said, "Fine.''HALDEMAN:Maybe he figured&#352;of course, see that&#8482;s--MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.9PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) seeing Colson keeps himclean on that, he's ridiculous. That's...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:...worse off than seeing Colson, he isseeing someone at the White House.PRESIDENT:Baker (unintelligible) administrativeassistant, you know what I meanHALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...to see Colson, but, I mean, if he--HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) interest. PRESIDENT:As a matter of fact, Dean is the one that'sthe least (Unintelligible). Absolute least.He has not a God-damn thing to do with the thing, you know what I mean. Just sitting there advising him and all that sort-ofthing. But, uh,--HALDEMAN:Well, the other thing they thought mightwork was, was, uhPRESIDENT:Moore?HALDEMAN:...using, using Wally Johnson, which wouldmake it routine then (Unintelligible) Congressional relations guys, and which...PRESIDENT:He's smartHALDEMAN:...clear--he's smart, but also clearly hasno involvement at all, I mean, he just doesn't know anything about the case and hedoesn't. He just wasn't, wasn't in itanywhere, and, uh, we've been trying that, but but, uh...PRESIDENT:What happened?MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.10HALDEMAN:...that, that, well, it was, we got the sameword, that Baker didn't want to have anycontact with the White House. He wanted tooperate separately.PRESIDENT:Well, why don't you raise the(unintelligible) there are other, other moreimportant things.HALDEMAN:Well, now that16 important too, perhaps ifwe can get...PRESIDENT:Some contact.HALDEMAN:...if we can get some contact with Baker andwork with him--(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Well, you need contact with Baker and youneed contact with Gurney.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Those are the only two fringe benefits.Right?HALDEMAN:Right. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Alright. HALDEMAN:Well, well, on the other side with, with,uh, (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Uh, I don't know (unintelligible) uh, no,not reallyPRESIDENT:But-- HALDEMAN:...except it's the closest to, to anythingwe've had as a tie on the other side.PRESIDENT:Sure.HALDEMAN:You might play a little bit both ways sincewe're taking off at this point.PRESIDENT:Yeah.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.11HALDEMAN:And it was worth, worth a try. You got nochance with, with Ervin or Inouye, or...PRESIDENT:Oh, no.HALDEMAN:No. PRESIDENT:Well, I admit, a couple more difficultsessions (unintelligible). Baker wants tocontact (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Oh, Christ. PRESIDENT:What the hell are we doing?HALDEMAN:He wants to make sure (unintelligible) setit up any way he wants, wants to do it.PRESIDENT:He wants (unintelligible)?HALDEMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:We've got to keep Colson (unintelligible),keep Colson's pick up date, Colson will be great in following up on anything you assignhim to do in that (unintelligible) basicallybecause of Ervin (urintelligible) competition (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Well, now, see, that's a lot of bull6hitfrom Colson. 'Cause Ervin isn't going torun the game, he's already annunciated that fact. So he doesn't have, doesn't need anycompetition. He's not running. So...PRESIDENT:Colson--does away (unintelligible)? HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Colson know that?HALDEMAN:Well, apparently not. We are, I've talkedto Dent and we've got the, the, well, things are going down there to get the, uh, we got,we got Gardiner on--MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.12HALDEMAN:Gardiner said (unintelligible) got him(CONT.)going on one side and they've got the sameguy going also. They're working in twodifferent directions. But it doesn't make any difference to, that Ervin hasalready--he hadn't made a, a formalannouncement. But, he's, he's put the word out that he isn't going to run. So, uh, (unintelligible) that we have competition.We still want to keep the heat on, not juston that, but the point is, until he formally isn't going to run, if you can get some guyslike Gardiner going, who are, who areirresponsible, you may be able to start destroying the Ervin myth a little bit...PRESIDENT:That's the point.HALDEMAN:...while he is still a potential runner,even if he doesn't run.PRESIDENT:Well, also, you have (unintelligible) afellow who's (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Yeah. Yeah.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) to work with him, he'spetrified.HALDEMAN:That, that--PRESIDENT:And, he doesn't say much. HALDEMAN:We've got to give Ervin some trouble, noquestion about that, but, but scaring himoff with election notices isn't going to doit, apparently.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Kleindienst scaring himoff, except to say that, well, he'll learn,he's probably going to, you know, convince himself (unintelligible).MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.13HALDEMAN:Well, the theory, the theory of the Ervinanalysis is that what he's trying to do isgo out and place authority. He wants to, heknows that he'll go down hill if he runs any more this (unintelligible). The action hewas after, cheerfully is once he gotinterested he, he then began analyzing--PRESIDENT:Just a little (unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Yeah. Precisely.PRESIDENT:We&#8482;ll, uh,--HALDEMAN:Yeah. (Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Right. Right. Well, getting back to whatwe do here, uh, what, uh, what do you havein mind, uh, the eventual (unintelligible)?HALDEMAN:Well, I think we, we&#8482;ve gotta lay out the-- PRESIDENT:One thing is very, as I told you, isextremely important. We've gotta, we haveto (unintelligible) in the sense that (unintelligible) responsibility on, a little more on Dean. He's got all office an--allthat, uh, and apparently his responsibilityon this--HALDEMAN:He can't use the office for most of this.He uses them to do his other work so that heworks out--they're sort of covering the base and providing the front for him so -that he's--PRESIDENT:Here's the thing, I think, I think,-- thisconcerns me, Bob. (Unintelligible) from Hunt and, uh, then, of course, we're tryingto figure how we're going to cut it out.Why (unintelligible) cut it out without hurting, killing a lot of people. Have trouble (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:That may be what you have to do.PRESIDENT:Now? Well, I don't know. The point is...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.14HALDEMAN:Then Dean, then Dean...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:...his argument is those people are going tobe killed anyway,...PRESIDENT:Well, that's the point.HALDEMAN:...why not kill them with a...PRESIDENT:Dean HALDEMAN:...clean bullet now? PRESIDENT:...Dean goes...HALDEMAN:And leave the, leave thePRESIDENT:Dean goes down the line and, and, and thenthe line is, uh, (unintelligible). He gets,uh, for example, it appears to me that it's,if you really want to look at the thing, it's, uh,--And he said completely the opposite. He says that he's involved. He,he--and-I said why the hell, how, how, howare you involved? He said because he was aware of and participated in the obstruction of justice by reason of the fact that, uh,he was aware of the fact that they were, uh,they had a fund to take care of these various defendants. I don't believe thatthat is going to be something that is goingto set Dean, myself, you know what I mean. That's, uh, well, when Dean ran the fund to--he didn't hand out the money. Othersdid.HALDEMAN:We, John and I worked on that with him.Perhaps he thinks I'm tied into that toobecause of this, in a sense, my fund that hewas taking.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well, I, I, that's the kind of thingI'd kind of like to get...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.15HALDEMAN:What?PRESIDENT:...out of the way.HALDEMAN:Okay, but, we're very clear on that, exceptthis concern is what they do on the other side. What happened was that is they, theyneeded the moneyPRESIDENT:Right HALDEMAN:...They were supposed to be getting itthemselves from other sources, from otherCubans and all that kind of crap...PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...So, they got back to a crunch once in awhile when a guy had to have another $3,000or something, or, or he was gonna blow, blow--PRESIDENT:Then, who did it? Dean? That's whatworries him.HALDEMAN:No. Then what happened-was, the only, seethey knew over there that the only money there was that was useable was this 350,000.PRESIDENT:Who's they, who's they?HALDEMAN:LaRue and Mitchell. PRESIDENT:Okay.HALDEMAN:And so, Mitchell said, "You've got to usethat money.&#64258; So, I said, "Turn the whole thing back to 'em. We don't want the money anyway. Give just enough, I've been lookingfor a way to get rid of it.&#64258; I'll admit Iwas, I was worried about this, this money. I wanted to get it back into the, where itbelonged. Uh, so, so, he gave it back tothem, and they wouldn't take, Mitchell wouldn't let them take it back, but he did say "You've got to use some of it.&#64258; SoDean told Strachan, who was the guy that hadthe...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.16PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...the physical possession to give Xthousand dollars to LaRue. So, Strachanwould go and open his safe, take out X thousand dollars and, and go trudging overto LaRue's, aiid, and this is all after theelection, this is in the--PRESIDENT:After the election? HALDEMAN:Yeah, on the, yeah, and this in--PRESIDENT:Oh, after the election.HALDEMAN:Yeah. And he would go over and giveLaRue...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...X thousand dollars and, and, we cancertainly claim that, that Strachan had no knowledge of what that was for&#352;he wascarrying out Dean's instructions; that Deanwas carrying out instructions from me; and you've gotta prove it for me. And my point there was, it's their money, give it back to'em, give it all back to 'em. So we weregiving--PRESIDENT:The way I would, the way I was going to sayabout it, of course, on the money was(unintelligible). First, what was it? The money was money that was, was collected without regard to the campaign laws atall...HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:...It was in cash. It was for the purposeof taking polls and surveys, and so forth,prior to that, and so forth...HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:...It was not used. After the election itwas a surplus...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.17HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:...It was turned back...HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:...Period. Right? HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Now, what happened to it after that? Do wehave to account for what happened to that money after the election?HALDEMAN:Well--PRESIDENT:If it was used to pay campaign bills--HALDEMAN:Yeah. Somebody has to. We don't have to,but the campaign has toPRESIDENT:Somebody has to what, now?HALDEMAN:...The campaign has to account for it. PRESIDENT:But it wasn't collected in the cam-- HALDEMAN:But they still have to account for--it was,it was cash on hand at the time of thecampaign. No it wasn't, 'cause they got rid of itPRESIDENT:Not in the campaign, not in the camp-- Mypoint is, I would not treat that, I, that,in my view, wasHALDEMAN:(unintelligible.)PRESIDENT:...not campaign funds. That wascampaign--that was not given for a campaign at all. These were funds that were, that were, shall we say, collected after the 1968elections and had nothing to do with anycampaign law, was not campaign funds, you know, for, for any purpose. They wanted toknow--what did they poll? They polled uh,what happened to Goldwater, what happened on the meat prices--MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.18HALDEMAN:Yes sir. Issue, issue polls.PRESIDENT:Issue pollsHALDEMAN:And thePRESIDENT:...and the rest. The study that you made... HALDEMAN:...geographic analysis--PRESIDENT:...and after that they returned it over tothe Campaign Committee.HALDEMAN:It was a gift to the Campaign Committee. PRESIDENT:Well I don't, I don't know. Anyway, it's aproblem, and that's--if Dean sees that, it'sa problem because the question will be asked. Dean is very good this way. You sawhow the next question would be, quack,quack, quack, quack.HALDEMAN:Well, it's a potential problem. If, if--Dean is inordinately worried about thatproblem because it does involve him.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:Uh... PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...his view, and we, this is what we weretalking about, I mentioned to you last night on the phone...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...his view that, putting... PRESIDENT:The White House-- HALDEMAN:...the wagons around the White House. AndDean's point is, when you get down to it,the White House literally doesn't have any problem prior to the Watergate break-in.And, in other words, there was n-, there wasno White House involvement in the Watergate, he's satisfied. That, that--MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.19PRESIDENT:Even Colson?HALDEMAN:He's satisfied with that.PRESIDENT:He thinks that telephone call, that's theone where...HALDEMAN:You see that's--yeah.PRESIDENT:...Colson has Liddy and Hunt in his officeand calls Magruder and says, "Get off your ass and do something.&#64258;HALDEMAN:Well, but, but, he argues that, that wasn'tnecessarily...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...and, and probably, and maybe...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...in reality, wasn't knowledge... PRESIDENT:I guess, but that-- HALDEMAN:...of the operation.PRESIDENT:I, I don't know--HALDEMAN:Now, he did know there was an intelligenceapparatus.PRESIDENT:I recall, (unintelligible) the ITT thing. Ican imagine Chuck and how he was. Hell,he'd go on for an hour about what he was trying to do, like that, and it wasn't like,that he was trying to get a counteroffensive. I don't know what he was trying to do.HALDEMAN:Yeah. That's when he was playing TeddyKennedy stuff. He was--PRESIDENT:That's right. Damn most (unintelligible).But, uh, well, anyway, I guess that--MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.20HALDEMAN:Dean's point is the only place that theWhite House is culpable...PRESIDENT:Yes.HALDEMAN:...in this thing... PRESIDENT:Uh huh.HALDEMAN:...in any criminal basis...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:...or any real basis... PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...is in the potential charge of obstructionof justice after the fact--that we have no problem with the crime itself.PRESIDENT:Right, and on that one he says, why don't wejust say we turned over the money?HALDEMAN:And I don't see why we're even, uh--it,it--so, so the money is used for su-,support stuff for defendantsPRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...Why is that obstruction of justiceanyway?PRESIDENT:Well, particularly when it's not to sipchampagne. I wouldn't say that, I guess maybe --HALDEMAN:You may not have to get into that at all,see. He's just worried that you might get into it. And, and if you follow his containment line, the odds...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...he feels, and, and I feel strongly onthis, are pretty good you won't get into it.He's just worried that there's a littlelurking some (unintelligible)...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.21PRESIDENT:Possibility (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...because somebody, well, because HughSloan knows that the money was deliveredhere. That's really where it, what it boils down to.PRESIDENT:Hugh Sloan knows it.HALDEMAN:Or if you put Gordon Strachan... PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...up before a Grand Jury...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...if they ask the right question Gordonwill never volunteer. He's a lawyer andhe's...PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah. HALDEMAN:...smart... PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and, he'll pull--PRESIDENT:But he must not, he must not perjurehimself.HALDEMAN:...But, if you get Gordon to a point wherethey say, "Was there any money?"...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...somehow...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...he may, they may get him into where-- PRESIDENT:But this had already been, some had beenused yet, -is it our money (unintelligible)?MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.22HALDEMAN:No. Well, yeah, but never a fund overhere...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...only that there -- that Stans had thisfund in his, in his safe, which he did,which, of course, he would have. He had acash fund in his, in his safe. It was used for, for various payments and that's where--PRESIDENT:As far as this is concerned, this is, is,I'd, I'd say constructively that Stans isclean. Now, to go on to, did you ever sign any (unintelligible)?HALDEMAN:I don't know. I didn't, I never saw him. Inever had a thing to do with the situation.PRESIDENT:There was nothing in writing involved in it. HALDEMAN:Well, Strachan may have had to sign areceipt when he took (unintelligible) uh, --PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). HALDEMAN:Well, what it was was that money... PRESIDENT:I know.HALDEMAN:...that we had left over from '70, 'memberwe collected all our cash in '70...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:...And, we told 'em not to spend all of itif they didn't have to. We ended up, we had a--and it was probably '68 surplus that we used in '70 and carried over...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...(Unintelligible) of course. PRESIDENT:Why don't we just say on this money...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.23HALDEMAN:The money (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:...Kalmbach's money (unintelligible)...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) Kalmbach.PRESIDENT:...was to be used, this was to be used forvarious candidates but was never used.HALDEMAN:It was to be used for candidate support andresearch.PRESIDENT:For candidate support and research. It wasnever used, turned over to the Committee atthe end of the campaign. What they did withit is their problem.HALDEMAN:That had been collected in years prior to1971.PRESIDENT:That's right. Very simple. HALDEMAN:Which is true, also. At least that was myunderstanding of that. Now, the problem isthat, I think those funds got mixed togetherand we never got all the money.PRESIDENT:Really? HALDEMAN:'Cause they told us we couldn't...PRESIDENT:Sure.HALDEMAN:...make a (unintelligible). Uh-- PRESIDENT:They didn't use what they thought they did.Anyway, (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) they thought they neededit. It was their point that under the laws there was no way we could, we could useit--which they were right.PRESIDENT:Which we never did.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.24HALDEMAN:There really wasn't. There wasn't even away we could use what we had.PRESIDENT:What you, what you mean is that you didn'tdo a thing with the money, which is good.HALDEMAN:See, I had the money, I was going to use itto pay for polls (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) you did the pollingthrough, uh,--HALDEMAN:...but they said they had the money to payfor it and they needed, they needed placesto show where they spend money, so they, so they paid for the bills.PRESIDENT:I would say that looking at the, at the reedthing,,now--Ehrlichman, for example, uh, he gets to him, uh,--HALDEMAN:Not on Watergate.PRESIDENT:No, but he gets to him on the, uh, on the,uh, Hunt, if Hunt, with Hunt's, uh,--HALDEMAN:But John doesn't think it does. It gets toKrogh.PRESIDENT:Well, that bothers me.HALDEMAN:It, and it clearly does, then it gets toDavid Young, and David Young is a weakerreed than Krogh.PRESIDENT:H-H-Has Young, uh, also lied? They both-- HALDEMAN:Well, they haven't gotten to Young yet, Idon't think. I shouldn't say that &#8218;cause Idon't know, I don't know.PRESIDENT:But, what were Young and... HALDEMAN:It's my impression that they...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.25PRESIDENT:...what were Young and--Krogh didn't, Kroghhit a critical question in his case,apparently, said he didn't know the Cubans(unintelligible). Now how does he get out of that? Has anybody thought of that?HALDEMAN:Well, Ehrlich-, Ehrlichman's view on-itis--which kind of surprises me-- is to be cold-blooded. Yesterday he said, "When Krogh gets finished with his lying--" hesaid, "Now I (unintelligible)" They saidthey know Krogh.PRESIDENT:It's a convicted felon against his word.HALDEMAN:Well, plus, they may not say-anything. You,you still--the Cubans seem to be the least matter of concern. They're, they're fanatics and they don't seem to really betoo concerned about their pulling the loadand their needs are, are fairly minimal, and Dean confirms again that Liddy, Liddy is enjoying, Liddy's in jail, he, he didn't...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...stay out, he, he said, "I want to startserving my term," and he's at, at, uh,Danbury and thoroughly enjoying it. He's alittle strange.PRESIDENT:That son-of-a-bitch of a judge gave him 35years --HALDEMAN:He may enjoy that. As long as he thinkswe&#8482;re gonna deal something up for him someday when he -- it's incredibly-- He'sgot five kids, and all he's concerned aboutis that there's enough income to take care of his kids and that's being taken care of right now by his father. And his lawyer'sgot something worked out.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.26PRESIDENT:God damn it, the people are in jail, it's onlyright for people to raise the money for them.I got to let them do that and that's all thereis to it. I think we ought to. There's gotto be funds. I'm not being, I don't mean tobe blackmailed by Hunt, that goes too far, but we're taking care of these people that are injail. My God, they did this for--we're sorryfor them. We do it out of compassion and Ididn't (unintelligible) the Cuban fund and thepeople that contribute to it didn't have toreport on that damn thing. There's no reportrequirement or any kind of requirement. You don't agree? What else should we do?HALDEMAN:That's why I--it seems to me that there's noreal problem on obstruction of justice as faras Dean's concerned, I mean--it, it doesn'tseem to me that we are obstructing justice,for Christ sake. The people--PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...pled guilty...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...when a guy goes and pleads guilty, are youobstructing justice?PRESIDENT:When you help his--HALDEMAN:His argument is, when you read the law, thatthe...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...that, uh-- PRESIDENT:Yeah, but, Dean didn't do it. Dean, I don'tthink, I don't think Dean had anything to dowith, uh, the obstruction. He didn't deliverthe money or, that's the point. I think whatreally set him off was when, uh, Hunt's lawyerwas off at this party and said Hunt needs a$120,000. Well, that was, that was a very,that was a, that was a shot across the bow.You understand, that that would have constituted God-damn blackmail if Dean hadgotten the money and never--You see what Imean?MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.27HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Let's come to the other... We, when you talkabout the wagons around-the White House,Bob, what, what really happens here is that, uh, we really have to take a hard look atthe situation and realize that,(unintelligible). I don't think that we can, uh--has anybody candidly suggested that Magruder was not aware (unintelligible)?HALDEMAN:I don't think so. I don't, I don't, I don'tknow, but I, I have, my opin-- I have no knowledge, my opinion is that he knewPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...And, uh, from the way he talks I'm, I'mthoroughly convinced of that. Dean is thoroughly convinced that he knew.PRESIDENT:Always pull through. (Tape noise) It'sMagruder's word against the others and he said he didn't.HALDEMAN:Well, nobody said he did.PRESIDENT:Well, did he (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Oh, yeah, but not--they haven't testified(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Speaking now, speaking now of what Deantells me--yes, that's what I'm going to do this afternoon--and, and Dean tells me things have gotten out of control; and hesays well (unintelligible) and asked him howMagruder was doing and Dean said Magruder perjured himself. Well, it's pretty rough.I'd say well, with that knowledge can Iappoint Magruder to a position in government? That's the problem, you see (unintelligible).MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.28HALDEMAN:You didn't appoint him to a position in theWhite House.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I hired him out. I'dsay...HALDEMANThat's exactly why we didn't let him getinto anything that was a Presidentialappointment. And you can also argue-that we should have told the Secretary of Commerce. On the other hand, we don't, we can't provehe perjured himself, that's Dean's opinion.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). -HALDEMAN:Well, Magruder, anyway, that's, we went thatroute for exactly that reason.PRESIDENT:No. No. We didn't. HALDEMAN:But, the other side of that coin is, ifyou're--unless you decide to throw Magruderto the wolves, you need to keep Magruder onas even a keel as you can. If you decide to throw him to the wolves, uh, (unintelligible) kind of problem, he's not aguy, he's not a Liddy type. He's exactlythe opposite.PRESIDENT:If you decided to throw him to the wolves,what does that (unintelligible)? Youwouldn't say anything (unintelligible). I mean, the point is, the point is we say that we have found that Magruder(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:No. We don't have anybody who can eventestify on Watergate, 'cause we don't haveanybody who knows anything about it.PRESIDENT:Except possibly Colson, and that's just abig possibility, possible. Yet, I don't, I don't. I don't agree that nobody else wouldknow. Strachan?MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.29HALDEMAN:Well, that's right. Keep forgetting aboutStrachan. And Gord--uh, what's his name,Dean says he's going to (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:What we do with getting information in sortof a--he may not have known about howwe're--you know what I mean. I thinkStrachan is, is not that bad if his-fish is gonna get fried. He's at too low a level.HALDEMAN:That's a good sign, I know it.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) he got a tremendous amountOf--he just got information, but he didn't issue-orders or anything on what he wantedto do.HALDEMAN:Right. You look at Gordon Strachan. Here'sa little, young lawyer, who used to work for John Mitchell in his law firm, and came-downto Washington to work in the government, andhe's working under a campaign with Attorney General of the United States is in charge of it. Now, how the hell do you expect him todecide whether something that's being doneis right or wrong?PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:I don't know, I don't think, (3ordon doesn'tI don't think, doesn't worry Dean much and he doesn't worry, I don't, I would not be concerned about Gordon. He is--PRESIDENT:A hell of a guy.HALDEMA`N:You never know about anybody. You know, Iwould have never thought that Navy aidewould have a nervous breakdown.PREMENT:Didn't you?(Unintelligible) can 'sure bewrong in picking people that--HALDEMAN:Uh, Gordon is a guy I wouldn't worry about.But, Magruder is a guy I would. BecauseMagruder is loaded with ego, personal pride, political ambition, uh...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.30PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...I make it this way: He's had some majorsuccess as a young guy, he's, you know, a, aboy wonder...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...and, uh, that kind of guy is, uh,--PRESIDENT:How does John answer the Ellsberg thing?That's the other point I wanted to raise, that, uh, John seems to say well,--HALDEMAN:He says, "I didn't know anything about it.&#64258;He, he says, "I didn't think they, I--"PRESIDENT:Talked about the (Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:No, he didn't. He says he didn't find outabout that.PRESIDENT:Krogli, Krogh did. But, what, what was,what were we doing at that meeting(unintelligible) is the whole point(unintelligible)? I'm rather curious to know myself.HALDEMAN:Well, you better ask John, 'cause I don'treally know. All I know is--PRESIDENT:All I know is that, I think it was part ofthat whole operation of John and Young,where we were just looking into the wholebusiness of leaks. Henry was in on that. Henry must be aware of some of that. I've got to--HALDEMAN:What they--the enterprise out of there,which is the key thing--that, that Hunt, you see, Hunt--, what Hunt says is that he'lluncover some of the sleazy work he did forEhrlichman. He said particularly remind him of the...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.31PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...of the...PRESIDENT:That's Ellsberg's affair. That's what Deantold me.HALDEMAN:Alright, and the Ellsberg affair--PRESIDENT:Yeah, what happened?HALDEMAN:I'm not sure what happened, but it hassomething to do with they sent Hunt out, and I guess the CubansPRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...to break in... PRESIDENT:To a doctor's office.HALDEMAN:...to a psychiatrist's office to get areport...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...on Ellsberg's mental analysis orsomething like that, and they bungled,bungled the break-in. They didn't get what they were supposed to get or something, and then they came back and said could they goback again and that request got toEhrlichman, and he said, "Absolutely not," he says. And they didn't, apparently.That's---PRESIDENT:Why did they want a report on(unintelligible)?HALDEMAN:I don't know, but they had--there was a lotof stuff. They had a lot of interestingstuff on Ellsberg that showed he was, that was--we got some of it.PRESIDENT:What was the purpose of it though? I mean,to discredit--?MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.32HALDEMAN:I forgot--Yes. (Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) make a spy out of him, and,uh...PRESIDENT:Oh, I see.HALDEMAN:Uh, uh--PRESIDENT:Did, did, uh, it make him look as bad afterall that national security was involved and so forth?HALDEMAN:WellPRESIDENT:I'm not sure I (unintelligible). HALDEMAN:And why were we using private people?Because the question, there was a valid, or,a real question here as to where the CIA and the FBI fit into it.PRESIDENT:Also, whether they were leaking--HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) because things were leakingfrom all over.PRESIDENT:They were leaking from all over and somebodyhad to find a way...HALDEMAN:And it had to be done independently.PRESIDENT:It had to be done independently because ofpossibility of, uh, leakage.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Huh? HALDEMAN:I don't know whether that'll hold up.(Unintelligible) that doesn't make it legalMARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.33PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) again. If you come back,why --HALDEMAN:That's a long stretched out(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I'm trying to get down to the end of thepoint, that the man who knows all this isHunt...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:So, Hunt becomes rather important.HALDEMAN:Probably.PRESIDENT:And Dean's line, Bob, if we want-- HALDEMAN:Dean's point on that one is that--PRESIDENT:Dean would say that he'd just cut that off(unintelligible). That's what you really come down to. Or you, you give him $120,000 or at least give him another contact, youknow what I mean? That's, that's a lot ofdough. Let's face it, in terms, uh, in terms, uh, of pardon, uh, or so forth, if, if Colson is talking, uh, of a pardon, uh,Christmas, you know, right after the factthat the court, that they're convicted, or either before they're sentenced-- he's outof his mind. He knows we can't do that.HALDEMAN:But if Hunt thinks that's what he's beenpromised...PRESIDENT:He'll shut up now.HALDEMAN:He'll, he may shut up now.PRESIDENT:Yeah, but my point is-- HALDEMAN:But, what, what do you do at Christmas time?MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.34PRESIDENT:Yeah. That's right. And the question is,the question is that now, it seems to meyou'd better find out from Colson what hedid promise. (Unintelligible) Don't you think so?HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:But you've got to go about that before he'ssentenced. (tape noise) a pardon. Well, what that would be a --HALDEMAN:But not if you get the Parole Board to, uh--A pardon might be, an early pardon, an early parole might not, if you get the ParoleBoard to...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...look at the point that the sentence was,was, uh...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...way out of proportion to the, to the-- PRESIDENT:Well, the point is that--Dean says that,that's why he's thinking of using Petersen.He says that, and Ehrlichman agrees, thatthe judge has the power to sentence him without parole, and that's a roughson-of-a-bitch, it seems to me for somethinglike this, on the ground that they didn't talk about it, you see. Might make it tough to, to pardon him. I think it would becurtains for him for that (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:But the point, the moral of it is that hedoesn't -- we don&#8482;t know what Sirica's gonna(unintelligible). Again, Dean looks at the,what might be the worst. It may not be the worst.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Laughter) In fact what usually happens issomething beyond what you thought was the worst.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.35PRESIDENT:Well, on the wagons theory, uh, that, what,what does that mean, I wonder, to put thewagons up around the White House. I meanthat--who do you let down the tube? Do you let Magruder down?HALDEMAN:You don't intentionally, you leaveMagruder-- what you do is, is you, see, we're, we're dcing stuff now. We're keeping quiet and, and, uh, all that...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...just try and cov--and, and putting upthis money and, and everything else. We'retrying to keep--when you get right down toit, as Dean says--the only White House guilt, culpability, is in the cover-up...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...and what, what's the purpose of thecover-up, to protect the White House? No, it protects some individuals of the Committee.PRESIDENT:Mitchell, Magruder.HALDEMAN:And the question then is how, whatindividuals, how far up does it go, thatyou're protecting? And we've already, we&#8482;renot protecting Liddy, so we, we (unintelligible) so, we got to talk to him. Uh, the question is, can it, can, if you,you could--his idea is you separate, youlook at the Committee as one thing, the White House as another.PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:The White House has no guilt in theWatergate thing.PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:So, you come up with wagons around the WhiteHouse, and you just, you just turn it up, you, you do whatever you do, issueMARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.36HALDEMAN:statements, issue a new statement, well,(CONT.)well, whatever, to totally cut off the WhiteHouse from the, from the, the wholeWatergate business. Now, at the same time you do that, it might be, we haven't gottento this, but, it might be, you also have todo the Segretti thing and, to a degree, implicate the White House, which is...PRESIDENT:That's---HALDEMAN:...fine. There must be a decent statement(unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I, I don't, uh, I don't know how you feelabout that...HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...or a statement, or a-- HALDEMAN:There has to be something. That's right.PRESIDENT:Or do you agree?HALDEMAN:Uh, no, I think you do, I think they do. PRESIDENT:I think we need, uh, I mean, let me say, letme put it, I have a certain balance(unintelligible) that Dean's statement, orthe Moore's statement, or what have you, sure will (unintelligible) and so forth, butit's better to have something rather thannothing. You know what I mean?HALDEMAN:Well, but then the questions that thatraises are-- they can successfully do that,but, can you, are you any better off if theWhite House is clean but your Campaign Committee's dirty, or if, if, if we cut thewhole thing off.PRESIDENT:That's not what I was referring to.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.37HALDEMAN:In other words, we need (unintelligible) theCampaign Committee and (unintelligible) theWhite House. First of all is thatbelievable? Uh, happens to be true, but can it be convincing? Uh, uh--PRESIDENT:Well, that, well, they, what you're --HALDEMAN:And Dean--if they get, if they get as highas Magruder, probably it doesn't hurt too much. If they get to Mitchell...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...uh, he's awfully close to you. PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:He's not as close to you as Ehrlichman and,I guess, that Dean and Haldeman now, which (unintelligible). Mitchell will find a way out. You have to let them get to him, Ithink. But, Dean's thought, I think whatconvinced him to put the wagons around the White House is that it forces Mitchell to take the responsibility rather than allowingMitchell to hide under the blanket of theWhite House, which he's been doing, and I think Dean feels that that's And, and in away, it does Colson too, uh, who's out. liefeels that, that Mitchell and Colson can take care of themselves.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:I don't know. But the, the, the problem isMagruder can't take care of himself, except with this straight line-- his, his present,uh, position...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.38PRESIDENT:Yep.HALDEMAN:...and see whether he can, can make itstick. Now, they may be able to hang him onthat...PRESIDENT:They'll kill him.HALDEMAN:...but still, it will get to, to a question.They may be able to indict him if they get other people to talk, but can they, can they--PRESIDENT:They'll convict him.HALDEMAN:...beyond a reasonable doubt? Maybe not, if,if he stays with his line, they may not beable to convict him. Then Magruder indictedand winning, uh, acquittal, may be a pretty good route for us to go. We won't know unless we try. And they're, what'll you doif they call us? We can't not go thereagain. And if I were the prosecutor, well, that decision, it's the Justice Department that prosecutes that, so maybe &#338;we cancontrol the prosecution and not call 'em.PRESIDENT:Well... HALDEMAN:But there again, at least if you call us,we're under rules of evidence and, and...PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...oh, and germaneness. PRESIDENT:You've got lawyers who object, you can go torelevancy there.HALDEMAN:Yeah, and they can only... PRESIDENT:Go to relevancy, that's no problem there.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.39HALDEMAN:So they can't go fishing. And there is noproblem, unless they get to Strachan andmaybe start running that stream.PRESIDENT:Another thought that has been raised is theidea that (unintelligible) things goingwrong (unintelligible) a Special Counselor.HALDEMAN:I don't know, not, not being a lawyer, I(unintelligible)-this kind of stuff, but, uh, Dean feels very strongly, and JohnEhrlichman seems to concur, that it would,that we do need the advice of somebody who knows more about the criminal set-up than wedo...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...and they-- PRESIDENT:We, can't go to Petersen--HALDEMAN:Well, they don't know Petersen's the guy.They wonder if, you know what we got into last night after we were in here, was the question of whether, I guess it was Dean,could call Petersen and just say we needadvice. Can I talk to you on a, on a totally confidential basis, outside ofschool, and it will (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:You wouldn't do that, uh, throughKleindienst?HALDEMAN:No.PRESIDENT:Kleindienst wouldn't (unintelligible) afteryou toldhim? I'm just, just asking.HALDEMAN:I don't know. That, that, the way that wewere talking, it's going...PRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:...to have to either be, uh...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.40PRESIDENT:Right. Okay.HALDEMAN:...just straight bilateral...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN...Dean to Petersen... PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...or Dean would just say I'm over, I'm overmy head on this...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...and, uh, I need counsel on an informaland totally confidential basis. Will yousit down and let me go through this with you? But it'd have, would have to beunderstood and it might--I recognize thatyou may be--can't do it because as the head of the Criminal Division it puts you on the other side. It can't be separated. Deanhas the feeling that the more Petersenknows, the more helpful he can be, and that he will be.PRESIDENT:I'm not sure that that's what you can counton.HALDEMAN:I'm sure you can't count on it, becausePetersen's another human being, too.PRESIDENT:And he's a knowledgeable man.(Unintelligible) you stuck somebody (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:But you don't know what his ambitions areand, uh--PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) and I just don't know. HALDEMAN:Well, I know they're all possibilities, butapparently, all the way through this he'sbeen a very solid rock.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.41PRESIDENT:(unintelligible) problems?HALDEMAN:The problems you qot with Petersen is thathe wants to go out in private practice withKleindienst.PRESIDENT:Well, I'd sooner take (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:And if you didn&#8482;t...PRESIDENT:What are you (unintelligible) tellKleindienst too?HALDEMAN:I don't think that, if you're going to dothis, you can't do it without KleindienstPRESIDENT:Right. HALDEMAN:And I think here you just gotta(Unintelligible)REEL TWO BEGINS PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I, I, I'll just call himand say (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Well, he used to, and I assume that that(Unintelligible) same ones, I think.END OF REEL ONE HALDEMAN, Uh, uh, he does.PRESIDENT:Not very good?HALDEMAN:Oh, it's gotta--it's some Of mostly the sameold stuff. It's the Anderson and all, uh,crap, and, uh, uh--da, well there is,there's one thing that we could build up that would, that I think we could get built up that would be pretty good, which is aboutthe extensive use of the FBI in the 1960, or4, Democratic Convention and an attempt to use them in &#8218;68. There is also somecover-up on Walter Jenkins, and someinstructions by Johnson to the FBI as to what they were to find when they were making this investigation and, uh--uh, I don'tthink we can use that, I mean, it isn't,that isn't--MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.42PRESIDENT:Too nasty?HALDEMAN:Ah. Then there's some Abe Fortas stuff theywere involved with. That was intended(unintelligible) to use Fortas to implicate (unintelligible). As precise(unintelligible) he didn't like but there'sa--I think you could blow a hell of a bombshell out of the, out of the '64 Democratic Convention---PRESIDENT:RESTRICTED-&#64257;B&#64258;HALDEMAN:PRESIDENT:anything on the tapping or the watching theair bug and all that sort of...HALDEMAN:Uh, the stuff on the air bug, we've gotten.Got DeLoach's stuff on that and all it is is that they did monitor the--PRESIDENT:Telephone (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Not the, not the content--they onlymonitored te--they, they did the check on, uh, where, to what numbers were calls placedand then they, they, uh checked them out.Didn't get--PRESIDENT:Our plane, our plane (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:And only when it was on the ground. Notthat I (unintelligible)--PRESIDENT:Still, to what numbers did he place calls?Still bad--No, not bad...HALDEMAN:You could, you could--PRESIDENT:That's right--MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.43HALDEMAN:You can distort them, that's the thing.(Unintelligible) Do what they do to us forChrist sake.PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:(coughs) Come out with a story that Haldemancontrolled the secret fund and then let usgo back and say what secret fund are you...PRESIDENT:You know, one fellow in this that--youshould not mention Mitchell, ah--one fellow(Unintelligible) who'd be very good. Heobviously, obviously doesn't (unintelligible) public position(unintelligible). The fellow, the bestfellow would probably be Walsh. Had a lot of experience and he's one, hell of a lawyer and I respect him (unintelligible) He'stotally incorruptible...HALDEMAN:(Laughs) PRESIDENT:(unintelligible) Nevertheless not a, not amean man (unintelligible). My problem isthat I--HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) a hostage (untelligible). PRESIDENT:Huh? Uh, what't the difference?HALDEMAN:Well, we gotta--we're up against the crunchwith him--ah, coming out--trying to move in on him.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) At least it's, uh(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Course not. PRESIDENT:What is it--PR?MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.44HALDEMAN:Yeah, and it's use...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...useful from...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:...from a totally different (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...to develop strategy. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). I, I was gonna say, or Iwas thinking I, uh, I'd rather hang than I'd-- think that I'll just (unintelligible)-having to rely on somebody, the people (unintelligible) any more heat(unintelligible) Dean has told me everythingI need to know. Now, I don't know where it all ends. Mitchell (unintelligible) and so forth and so on. And I am sure that weshould be (unintelligible). Now thequestion is how to handle it. (unintelligible) if Mitchell would take some responsibility (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) comes out of this.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well -- HALDEMAN:Pick a few and, -ah...PRESIDENT:Sure, I...HALDEMAN:...12:30 PRESIDENT:...I&#8482;m available as soon as I finish mymeetings, actually. I think 1:30(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Be about the time we finish. PRESIDENT:I guess so. That'll give you plenty of time(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Well, 12:30, actually. PRESIDENT:Well, you know, and I have to eat somethingand I'll grab something to eat, get him tosign (unintelligible) and all that sort ofthing so we'll back at it.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.45HALDEMAN: Right.PRESIDENT:But in looking at it all, as you wellrealize we Ire not going to let this damnthing eat (unintelligible) and, uh. (Unintelligible) Remember cause I'm the onethat (unintelligible) but ah, Bill Rogersand I (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Oh really? PRESIDENT:Eisenhower was a pretty tough nut(unintelligible) which of course is a bad(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Oh, Mitchell's been delayed (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Huh? Oh, I see.HALDEMAN:Just this morning--MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.46PRESIDENT:Well --HALDEMAN:I'm sorry.PRESIDENT:You still got -- you see, that will give himeleven to -- what I would suggest is you eat, have lunch, ah, you know, about oneo'clock (unintelligible) he won't here tillabout 1:30, how's that? That will give you a couple hours to--HALDEMAN:I'll say this, that, uhPRESIDENT:Sure. We, uh, we've gotta talk, go overwhat are the problems of the people just working their butts off for what theythought was the right cause, you know what Imean. And, uh, it was the problem of the (unintelligible) committee (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Jeb was, too, but (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:It was the little people, it wasn't -- youknow what I mean? It involved different things, but I'm referring back to the Watergate. That was terribly stupid, uh,something which you, I would never haveapproved (unintelligible). Who the hell, who the hell would have done it?(Unintelligible) hire somebody to do asecond story job? So, so that's, that's the case. It's--- on the other hand, for that reason, I, I do not want, to, I, uh,recognizing that (unintelligible), talkabout where we'll cut the cancer out. Question is whether we really can. Questionis whether, if you, if you cut a lot ofheart out and so forth the patient can still be (unintelligible). You get my point?HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:I just don't know. I, I, I, I'm at stake.We've got to take the institution of the Presidency. we've got to, and, uh, theability, mind you, to conduct, uh,' policywith some confidence in it, you know, confidence in the office.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.47HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:We cannot allow this kind of thing to leavea, shall we say, a, sort of an aura whichwould hurt us, in that respect. Uh, let me say, I, I, I do not (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:I don't think it's as bad as, as John isconcerned that it is. on the other side of the cancer analogy is that you can go in and cut out all of what you think iscancerous...PRESIDENT:Still there. HALDEMAN:...and discover that uh, that uh, it wasn'tmalignant. And if you, you, ya, cut off twolegs and a breast, when you didn't need to...wrong way.PRESIDENT:Maybe you cut off the wrong leg.HALDEMAN:...or the wrong leg, you know, and, uh--PRESIDENT:See the point is, if the cancer thing was asure thing then we might have to consider that. On the other hand since it is a riskything, at best, in other words that we'renot sure, my view is that you're next best thing is to take a position of, uh,continuing to be as forthcoming as possible,put out a, and put out a, a sort of statement and just sort of fight it out and drag through. (unintelligible) Mitchell(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:I wish we could be forthcoming on theSegretti (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:I considered that, Bob, I considered(unintelligible)MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.48HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) get back to the wall.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:I don't think our set of assumptions fitJohn's. That ah, I think the tougher part of all this -- which was, ah, this FBIinvestigation, Grand Jury investigation andthen the trial, and that the Senate thing won't (unintelligible) will be less of a problem, partly because everything's alllaid out.PRESIDENT:Everything's ducky. HALDEMAN:Everything's all established, and, ah, thecharacters have rehearsed their parts. And,uh, it's a matter of (unintelligible) and all that kind of stuff, and, uh, that they'll hold.PRESIDENT:John's concern there is that the Senate(unintelligible) secretaries-, and stenographers, press. (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:But they, they'll blow it up. They'll blowit up if there's anything in it at all.They've proven that. They blow it up. They blow the same story up every week, anyway.No question that they're blowing it up.John's...PRESIDENT:Why not? HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Well, it's, if you go the other way, if you,if you do the cancer thing, that'll blow upthey'll blow that out too. They'll blow thehell out of that. Anything you do -- John says fire some people, and I said well, who do you fire?MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.49PRESIDENT:Yeah. Right. That's right.HALDEMAN:You -- and, I don't know. You go back,there's nobody in the White House that,that's fireable.PRESIDENT:Well, in the Government, it could beStrachan, and, uh--HALDEMAN:And Magruder. PRESIDENT:Magruder. HALDEMAN:Neither of them were hired by you.PRESIDENT:I know it.HALDEMAN:So -- they both work in the ExecutiveBranch, you could say that they're not thecalibre of people we want to continue in theExecutive Branch, so you'll fire them. Then, then you got a problem, I think, with Magruder. (Unintelligible) I don't thinkMagruder can hang anybody (unintelligible) Idon't think he would hang Mitchell for some reason. I would guess who he'd go for is Colson.PRESIDENT:Colson (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:He might go for me, for leverage, but he'dhave a problem there. He could get,apparently, uh--PRESIDENT:He wouldn't go for -- HALDEMAN:He could get Gordon, too. PRESIDENT:That's right. And I think he could getColson, because Colson (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:No. That's different, but he -- Colsoncalled him about that matter.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.50HALDEMAN:That's right, -- which I didn't and youknow...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:He now thinks I did, I guess. The(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Well, anyway...HALDEMAN:No question about -- PRESIDENT:The point is (unintelligible) HALDEMAN:And Colson says he knows he did it, too.PRESIDENT:Who was that? Colson, I believe who had thecall --HALDEMAN:I think he denies knowledge of, of what theprocess...PRESIDENT:The call-- HALDEMAN:...was by which there -- he get theinformation that he received.PRESIDENT:Colson didn't discuss (unintelligible).Dean is the one who said, "No&#64258;. -- and Mitchell,too -- "You can't do that.&#64258; (Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:There was another bone, apparently,be-because (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I must say, the only thing I would like tosee is, uh, that, uh (unintelligible) thePresidency with some kind of a statement on the whole business, including Segretti, and uh, and frankly give them the(unintelligible). Give them a bone.HALDEMAN:Except there, Dean argues -- and I don't seehow it hangs -- Dean argues you'd get Chapinon a criminal indictment.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.51PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:See, he's found another criminal indictmentwhich has to do with the obstruction of thepolitical process.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) but you can't, but youcan't put out a statement --HALDEMAN:I'm not sure you can indict him. I don'treally see why you can't put the whole thing out (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:But you see, why, that is, maybe(unintelligible) just put out that statement to the effect that we were not involved inthis, that, and the other, and so forth.(Unintelligible) look forward and we will cooperate (unintelligible) offer again. Period. (Unintelligible)(Ticking sound)HALDEMAN:How I am on all of this, that is, if you'restill -- I don't know now, I'm, I'm confused in my own mind, and I think everybody is alittle bit -- categories of information --is what has been printed in the press and therefore is the mental public facts...PRESIDENT:That's right.HALDEMAN:Or presumed public facts... PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...Then there is a category which is thetestimony, under oath, that's been given inexecutive session and to the Grand Jury and in private...PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:...interrogation by the FBI... PRESIDENT:Right.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.52HALDEMAN:that ah, is fact as stated by participantsbut that has not yet become public. There'sstill a little of that, I think. And thenthere's the third category which is the actual fact...PRESIDENT:The facts are.HALDEMAN:...which has not been covered in testimonyor public coverage and you almost need to set up three columns on each question, eachitem...PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:...and look at those three things and thensee what you're dealing with there. Becauseyou may find, as you break that down, that what's the actual fact isn't any worse than either the sworn secret facts or the publicfacts and that you're better off to move theactual out across the line here.PRESIDENT:All right -- now -- How can you move theactual out. That puts, uh, that comes backto (unintelligible) the thing we assuredmost people (unintelligible) to the Grand...HALDEMAN:Part of the Grand Jury.PRESIDENT:...that their -- how do you want to handleit? (Unintelligible). Maybe that's the problem. I don't know. That's another thing (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:I think that it-then Dean's afraid youthen-- that's what sets you for getting into the obstruction of justice. Plus you --PRESIDENT:I see. (Unintelligible) did his job verywell (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Hell, yes, that's -- the worst thing wecould do is take some step and then wonderwhy we didn't think of other things.PRESIDENT:What? HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.53PRESIDENT:Yep. But what --HALDEMAN:We'll have --PRESIDENT:We'll have'em there, you know, we'll have,we'll have to have at least (unintelligible) and, uh, and also (unintelligible). Thebiggest danger on all this really is that(unintelligible).HALDEMAN:I think that we could, but I don't thinkwe&#8482;re out -- well, what's the danger ofhaving a speech?PRESIDENT:Well, you know, (unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Not on television...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Do you have what you need for a -- are you,are you going to do a press conference nextweek, or a speech?' Are you still hanging fire on that?PRESIDENT:No, I'm set.HALDEMAN:Do you want any material for the weekend...PRESIDENT:No. HALDEMAN:...either way?PRESIDENT:I've decided that, uh, if I do a pressconference (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:The question, uh, with the Congress, if yougo on, I mean, Tuesday may be too soon --from, from the Vietnam viewpoint. If theypull the prisoners, the prisoners, where, and, and the troops out (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).HALDEMAN:Better wait and see (unintelligible) PRESIDENT:The prisoners, oh, the prisoners(unintelligible)MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.54HALDEMAN:Oh -- Okay then, you don't need any, anyother raw data for the, for theCongressional speech, and if you do the,press conference, it would be Thursday so you wouldn't need the briefing book til...PRESIDENT:Monday or Tuesday.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Okay. (Unintelligible) As far as the rawdata is concerned (unintelligible) and soforth and so on. I mean I, I'm, I'm just,I'm gonna have to sit and think it through...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...Come up with a plan (unintelligible) comeup (unintelligible)...HALDEMAN:I think that (unintelligible) (Noises)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I think it's the best thingto do...HALDEMAN:I do too. PRESIDENT:...I think it's better than trying to gobefore a press conference...HALDEMAN:I do too. PRESIDENT:...and the other possibility is to not doanything (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:That's what this, God-damn Watergate stuff&#352;Pat Gray's stuff and all this crap -- it's not the people's obsession. So you will betalking about a subject that, that they wantto talk about instead of (unintelligible) Congress.PRESIDENT:You get -- Congress you're all right. Thepoint if I want a press conference that's what'd be.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.55HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:It'd probably -- if I don't do the Congress,in other words, go ahead at night pressconference, it's not a good idea to (unintelligible) next week. Don't you agreewith that?HALDEMAN:I, that's probably so. Yeah. PRESIDENT:You know, we'd just badger, beleaguer peopleto understand it. Know what I mean?(Unintelligible) escalate the issue.There's a hell of a lot more here (unintelligible).HALDEMAN:I think, unfortunately, I think that'sprobably rightPRESIDENT:Well, let's fact it. We, we've done this(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:Unless you want the chance to hit thoseissues -- which was the other--PRESIDENT:Impossible. HALDEMAN:Well, uh (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Hit Watergate and Segretti--HALDEMAN:Yourself, yeah. But then we gotta getsomething...PRESIDENT:This isn't the right -- it, it -- I don'tbelieve it's the right time yet. My view of the right time on that is once the Ervin Committee starts, oversteps, or somethinglike that. In other words, when it's in --let me put it this way to you Bob: when a subject is of major concern, and the peopleare interested, I can go on and knock thehell out of them.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I should not be the one totake a negative subject...MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.56HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:...and make it one of major concern.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Now, ah, that's the type thing, I thinkthat's a very good theory, but not a greatone.HALDEMAN:Yeah. My argument... PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) HALDEMAN:...the argument against that would be, uh...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:...it would be to your advantage to get onthe record before they do so that you're noton the defensive (unintelligible) but Idon't think--PRESIDENT:To be perfectly candid with you, uh. You'regoing to be on the defensive, come hell orhigh water...HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:...I mean, look at the last time out, I wason the defensive all the time.HALDEMAN:Exactly.PRESIDENT:And it's better-- HALDEMAN:Especially in a press conference, if youdon't want be on the defensive...PRESIDENT:I think... HALDEMAN:...the way to do it is in a... PRESIDENT:...I think...HALDEMAN:...a statement.MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.57PRESIDENT:...I think the press conference(unintelligible). That type of pressconference will help, even though I was on thedefensive, but we got out points across. Doyou not agree?HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:But I don't think a national press conferencebeing on the defensive (unintelligible) doeshelp. That's my view, you see.HALDEMAN:Well, it, it, s-, it bangs into the publicmind...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...the President being badgered... PRESIDENT:Beleagured.HALDEMAN:...uh, uh, about Watergate.PRESIDENT:So ah -- which is one of those things. I dothink that we (unintelligible/REMOVED) goingout, I mean the press conference(unintelligible/REMOVED)HALDEMAN:Certainly.PRESIDENT:...and, uh, they've all been televised.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) need to do a press conferenceof any kind.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). Right. The question iswhether we want (unintelligible) that's whythe speech to the Congress -- do somethingwith regard to a what the difficulties(unintelligible) a-little harsh(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:No (unintelligible) just turn it the otherway. Just say the cost of living last weekwent up That's exactly the point I'm trying tomake this is what pol-, what I'm fighting.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:If you hang it out (unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Well, you might.HALDEMAN:That's why you vetoed the vocationalrehabilitation (unintelligible).MARCH 22, 1973, FROM 9:11 TO 10:35 A.M.58PRESIDENT:Yeah. (Unintelligible) thing is appealingat the moment and I, and I might do it --(unintelligible) going right up the wall.If I do it (unintelligible). It will not be, it will not be well, uh, it will not beone of these- types of reasons(unintelligible) one that reason with (unintelligible) well--HALDEMAN:That's all right.PRESIDENT:But they've got to (unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)
