PRESIDENT:The, (pause) did you see that piece?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, I did.PRESIDENT:I told Ron that obviously the secretary,I've run down the background.EHRLICHMAN:Yes, good.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) I guess Dean has reallybeen shot across the bow there (unintelligible) he's the scapegoat.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Have they made a deal with him of any kind? PRESIDENT:No, sir, no, sir, not yet. So. Discussthat one through.EHRLICHMAN:All right. (Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:But you know on the other hand what the -Ijust don't know what the hell Dean can talkabout, he knows a hell of a lot, but uh,EHRLICHMAN:Well, we're going over that now. PRESIDENT:I see.EHRLICHMAN:Taking time to kind of spin it all out, butit's pretty hard to, uhh...PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:but it's pretty hard to see howAPRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.2PRESIDENT:I understand he's still in the White Housestaff, where there's a problem as towhether...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:We're going to fight that (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, well, I'm sure if he were not, hewould not have been as restrained as that.PRESIDENT:Yeah, I figure it's best to keep him here. EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:I had Ron call him and check and say that,'we're going to say that there's not going to be any statement, we're trying to get thetruth and my question (unintelligible)whether or not (unintelligible/REMOVED) thelawyers (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Well, they're going to go right over there,this afternoon.PRESIDENT:They are, fine, and... EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible). PRESIDENT:That's what I went through (unintelligible)I told him about Hunt and the S.C. thing,the investigation, and, I mean, our investigation, why we had to do it, and howwe're going to do the other thing and soforth and so on (unintelligible) the Department of Justice (unintelligible). I said, "What else did Hunt do?&#64258;(unintelligible) I said, I think he did, Ithink he was working in other fields regarding leaks to this matter.EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:And I said, unless, but I don't wantanything involving eavesdropping, which was carried on (unintelligible), is thatcorrect?APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.3EHRLICHMAN:Yes, as far as I know.PRESIDENT:Yes, fine, but Dean, was Dean in charge ofthis?EHRLICHMAN:No, no. PRESIDENT:This was ours, okay. But Dean must knowabout it, is that right?EHRLICHMAN:I think he must. PRESIDENT:Ah, he was concerned about the Grand Jury,he was very concerned.EHRLICHMAN:Good.PRESIDENT:I said (unintelligible). He said it's justterrible. He didn't know what to do.EHRLICHMAN:Our-, our attorneys think that may befatally defective.PRESIDENT:Fatally defective. EHRLICHMAN:May be an illegal Grand Jury.PRESIDENT:Well, don't you think you'll get anotherGrand Jury?EHRLICHMAN:I suppose they could, but, it may just itjust may screw up this whole process.PRESIDENT:Would you do that? This Grand Jury is, uh,for anybody.EHRLICHMAN:The prosecutors have a tough decisionwhether to go forward with these cases,these new cases with this Grand Jury or go right out and reprocess everybody through another one. (Pause)APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.4PRESIDENT:I asked Bob Haldeman, I said, "Look, suppose Iuse him as an example, such as to postpone (unintelligible), would it affect our(unintelligible) much stress on that?&#64258;(Unintelligible) I put it to him, I said,"Dean inferred to me that if Haldeman andEhrlichman left, uhh, that, uhh, that would beyou," meaning if Petersen could grantimmunity. He said that's not true. He said itwould have much effect on the immunity(unintelligible) of the corroboration. I suppose Dean's theory, I suppose that isbasically he carried out the orders of others.I said, "Does that put -what effect does thathave?&#64258; He says only in litigation, now, youcan't an agent committing a crime, so, youcan't do that, so Dean rebutted the situation,what he's going to get, he's going to get total immunity, or whether he's (pause) and Isuppose, the way I look at it, all we've gotto consider is if we really got this thing(unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:...with the facts coming out and whethergiving him total immunity is going to make himact better. Your view is to have him hold itover us for the rest of our lives -is thatyour point? That would be my theory. These fellows don't seem to think Dean can getimmunity at this point, but they're going togo down and talk to Glanzer and see what'sgoing on.PRESIDENT:Good, the second point with regard to thecases, uh, the case, are you (unintelligible)much of a case, the deep six thing and theysaid that (unintelligible), Bob, I said, itlooks to me if you get the contents to Gray, Gray could do that on that much, and he said(unintelligible) Ehrlichman and Dean...EHRLICHMAN:That's arguable, I was there.PRESIDENT:All right, fine. That's all. But, I said dideither of those things occur, and I said Ididn't raise the point did it all occur before(unintelligible).APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.5PRESIDENT:(Continued)The other thing is, I suppose, how else doyou get Ehrlichman in on the conspiracything, you know. Well, I simply say perhaps the only way you could possibly would bethat Dean (unintelligible) Ehrlichman withregard to the need for bugs for the defendant, now he did put you at one point, did he not?EHRLICHMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:And including, of course, this last time,did he about this last...EHRLICHMAN:Bittman? Yes, I expect he lied.PRESIDENT:What did you do with the earlier point? EHRLICHMAN:The early one I told him it was all right tocall Kalmbach.PRESIDENT:Now, how do we... there I suppose that's adefense vulnerability.EHRLICHMAN:These fellows say, they're not completelyfinished, we're right in the middle of thisright now, but their tentative view is thatwe have to look at it as you're doing, from two standpoints, the illegal and theapparently, ah, doubtfulPRESIDENT:Let's get the illegal first. EHRLICHMAN:Okay, well, they say there's nothing illegalabout that.PRESIDENT:Why not?EHRLICHMAN:Cause I wasn't an actor. See, the reason hehad to come to me in order to call Kalmbachis that Kalmbach didn't want to work forSta-ns any more. And we used a pretext with blark that Kalmbach was going to be under Bob and my aegis from now on to do specialprojects, and so he couldn't be a fundraiser any more.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.6PRESIDENT:I see.EHRLICHMAN:It was effective the sixth of April.PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:And so, Mitchell and Stans had been toldthat the only way they could use him is ifwe okayed it. And that was to protect herfrom having all kinds of demands made on his time by the committee.PRESIDENT:So he came to you and asked you...EHRLICHMAN:Dean said, "Would youPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) nothing but illegal in thatcase but what about the conspiracy thingthere, they, they (unintelligible) that'swhy I was digging, that we've got him as far as the the conspiracy.EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's, that's, that's arguable, thesefellows seem to think that there's alegitimate defense in that, that doesn't elevate, that doesn't get up to the level of being an actor in a conspiracy.PRESIDENT:That's all involved in the case. The caseinvolved is harder. He said that basically it gets down to a conflict in testimonywhich they cannot resolve, between Strachanand Magruder into letting into thinking of asking you to take a lie detector test. Don't like that but maybe we have to dothat, I don't know. Not going to get intothat. Strachan in effect says that Haldeman did not receive the specifics the budget,you know, and I don't know what Haldemansays on that or not. I think he says he can be either, and that, that Haldeman did not receive Watergate stuff that wasrecognizable as such. Magruder, he says,said Haldeman received the budget. I don't know what Magruder has gone far as to to sayhe received the specifics.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.7EHRLICHMAN:(Unintelligible) synopsis.PRESIDENT:Got it?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) huh? EHRLICHMAN:He does.PRESIDENT:Magruder said that?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, he said that to me. PRESIDENT:But, and the , and the, uh,, of the budget? EHRLICHMAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:But did it indicate that bugging wasinvolved?EHRLICHMAN:That Strachan got it. He says he doesn'tknow if Bob got it.PRESIDENT:Then Strachan way have committed perjury. EHRLICHMAN:No, Strachan devoutly, sincerely, and withevery fiber of his being says he never gotit, that he would remember if he ever got abudget that said anything like that, he'd know.PRESIDENT:And Magruder says that he received thebudget here.EHRLICHMAN:They sent it over. PRESIDENT:Right.And Magruder's also saying that theinformation.EHRLICHMAN:The transcript of the synopsis... PRESIDENT:Yeah, the synopsis. EHRLICHMAN:I see.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.8PRESIDENT:The other thing is that Haldeman'sapparently are ordering or anticipating theorder to rehire Liddy, now, I don't know hedidn't mention this, but very important(unintelligible). They are farfrom having this case nailed down.EHRLICHMAN:Did he say anything about timing? PRESIDENT:No, nothing this weekend they haven't madetheir deal with Magruder yet.EHRLICHMAN:So, he's not going in this week.PRESIDENT:No, sir. (Unintelligible). Well, he said,I said, look I might take off for Easter, hesaid, "Yeah," so apparently...EHRLICHMAN:Will they recess the jury for Easter? Well,anyway, he won't go, before Monday, is that what yourPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) no, I got time, yeah. Andof course Haldeman ordered the three fifty to be paid. Knowing that it would be paid to the defendants. Nowt Haldeman agrees onthat, does he?EHRLICHMAN:Uhh, no, uhh, we've gone into that inelaborate detail with the lawyers thismorning.PRESIDENT:What do they say on that? EHRLICHMAN:John Wilson says there's nothing illegalabout what you did, Mr. Haldeman. ThePresident has to decide whether theappearance of it regarding...PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). I hope there isn'tanything on it.EHRLICHMAN: He said, he said not, because of Bob's state ofmind at the time.PRESIDENT: Bob was not intending to try to keep the...APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.9EHRLICHMAN:He was attempting only to get rid of moneythat he had that didn't belong to him, andwhat the recipient did with it, he didn'thave any control, intent, design.PRESIDENT:Yeah, but if he knewEHRLICHMAN:Or contemplation.PRESIDENT:(Pause) (Unintelligible) if... he knew. EHRLICHMAN:Well, what he, he' s told Wilson everythinghe knows what he knew then...PRESIDENT:Yeah, when Bob handed the money overBobknew that it was going to the defendants.EHRLICHMAN:Not of a certainty, not of a certainty, hedid not, and that's something Wilson boredin on very hard this morning. He said, "Now, Mr. Haldeman, in effect, would you have been surprised to learn that instead ofusing that money for the defendants, theyhad used it to pay printing bills?&#64258; and Bob, says, "Well, I didn't have that strong a conviction about what they were going touse it for. I knew they needed money overthere, "but, uhh, he said, "No, it wouldn't it wouldn't have surprised me," so thenWilson bored in on him two or threedifferent ways.. This old boy is good, he's uhh, he's quite something. When we got all done, he said, "Well," he said, "I know thequestions in the President's mind," and hesaid, "I, I want to reserve, get all done today," but, he said, "You must bear in mindthe difference between a criminal act...PRESIDENT:Yeah, and what else did he say? EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;...and the problems presented to thePresident by the mere appearance."PRESIDENT:Yeah, which basically incidentally that I,it isn't that I trust this fellow Petersen in a way, he's trying to do his best, hejust all (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Sure.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.10PRESIDENT:He lost Mitchell...EHRLICHMAN:Sure.PRESIDENT:He lost the White House.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:But you know that's the way it is.EHRLICHMAN:I understand.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) he got Dean, too. EHRLICHMAN:Yes, I know he did. PRESIDENT:Now, the only thing that I, that comes tothe back of my mind is that you got to dothat the last conversation of Dean about that one hundred and twentyEHRLICHMAN:With Bittman.PRESIDENT:Uhh, with somebody. PRESIDENT:Did Deantell us about that...tell me aboutthat.EHRLICHMAN:About Hunt demanding it?PRESIDENT:That Bittman said that Hunt needed $120,000for attorney's fees et cetera.EHRLICHMAN:Right, right.PRESIDENT:And, the way Dean's going to tell it or he'sgoing to blow the whistle, right?EHRLICHMAN:Ah, yeah, now blow the whistle on thenational security operation. That was thethreat.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.11PRESIDENT:Was it?EHRLICHMAN:Yes, sir. And, you'll remember our responseto that was, you cannot defend blackmail, inthat kind of a situation.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And that's all that is, is pure blackmail.PRESIDENT:Huh. EHRLICHMAN:And we said, "No dice.&#64258; and I could be justas flat out on that as that's the honest toGod truth.PRESIDENT:Now let me put one other question to youright very painful, I know it's very painfulfor you to think of this, and it is for metoo, but anyway, but, uhh...EHRLICHMAN:(Laughs). PRESIDENT:I think it would be helpful if you had this(unintelligible) when you talk the rest ofthe day, this and that, bother you the rest of the day. I think the separation problem has to be considered. I want you to look atit very coldly in terms of, uh, in terms ofthe President. (Unintelligible)-the needs that we have and an atmosphere, Mr. So andSo, look at this thing, in terms of your,about how you're involved in terms of whether it's going to be (unintelligible) I don't know how you were involved but Deanmay say. The son-of a-bitch is unsafe. Idon't know what you do with the Dean (Unintelligible) he's obviously very upset.He's just lashing out. Goddammit, I don'tknow what we've been told. I just don't know what (unintelligible). Frankly, I'm at a loss. We were all talking frankly, that'swhy the counsel was sworn.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.12EHRLICHMAN:Well, as I said...PRESIDENT:That goddamn Dean.EHRLICHMAN:As I said this morning, I think you can verytruthfully and logically and properly say that...PRESIDENT:I was trying to bury, I was trying, I wasreally trying to probe his thought processes. I went down every road we possibly could...EHRLICHMAN:Exactly right.PRESIDENT:and see where we were. EHRLICHMAN:And it paid off. You see, you're the onewho then came back and said, "I've go tohave that all written down. Send that man to CampDavid if necessary and have him take as much time as necessary and let's getit all down." That's when he was uncovered.PRESIDENT:I suppose that really isn't true. EHRLICHMAN:Well... PRESIDENT:Not thathe was uncovered, it was simplythe fact thathe said, "By God, this thingis such a cancer and so forth, that I can't write it and there's no way we make astatement," and I said to you, John, "Youbetter get into it.&#64258; TakeEHRLICHMAN:Yes, but I happen to be... PRESIDENT:Well...EHRLICHMAN:This maybe some measure of hindsight, butI reallydon't think it is because my very consciouscontemporary reaction when Deancame backand didn't have anything for us,was, whoops, there's something more here, because Dean could have constructed some kind of an artful ah, ah, evasion if hehadn't been so pervasively involved.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.13PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)EHRLICHMAN:For the, for the campaign committee or theWhite House, or whoever he wanted toprotect, but, uhh, the thing that occurred to me when, when Bob told me what Dean saidthat he couldn't, he couldn't write it. Ijust had a mental image of the guy sitting there with big piles of paper saying, " I've just written a confession, and I would benuts to deliver this to anybody."PRESIDENT:Well, that's what we have to say. EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think, I think that's very veryprobable.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). EHRLICHMAN:Yup. PRESIDENT:Dean's got Shaffer and the rest. I don'tknow that he can't be, we may be able toexert privilege on Dean before the Grand Jury but we can't before the press. I (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:You can at the trial. And you certainly canin the press. Uh, uhPRESIDENT:(Unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:I'd send, I'd send a fellow around to talkto Dean if this is a problem. Just say, "Look here, you are going to be liable, separately liable, for breach ofconfidentiality and, ah,PRESIDENT:Is that a case? EHRLICHMAN:...Well, I think you ought to get Petersento advise you on this, but there certainlyis, there certainly is a statutory protection, and I think you could invoke it.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.14PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) breach of confidentialityof a conversation with the President?EHRLICHMAN:Well, no, not as such, but on variousnational security bases, I, I'm just not that familiar with the statutes. I don'tknow what all you have in the way ofstatutory protection, but you remember that our CIA case...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...where the guy was enjoined by thecourt...PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...we fell back on that body of law.PRESIDENT:Incidentally, the other point he says thatDean obviously knows all of these and that's why he says Bittman is gravely concernedabout the matter of the"120 because thatgets him involved.EHRLICHMAN:Sure. PRESIDENT:So, we may not, just Dean may talk aboutthis but Bittman is not likely to. I wouldsay, "What the hell is in it for Bittman to say that we asked for that.&#64258; I just askyou, does that (unintelligible) the lawyer?EHRLICHMAN:Boy, put him in the soup. Put him in thesoup, sure.PRESIDENT:That he came and said, "I want 120 for...EHRLICHMAN:You bet.PRESIDENT:&#64257;...for, or otherwise you're going to blowthe whistle or something."EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, yeah, you're right.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.15PRESIDENT:So here you've got a --EHRLICHMAN:So this is good information. Would behelpful, this fits right into ourconversation in there. I will talk, I'll tell you what I think I would doPRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...if you don't mind, I will take JohnWilson aside and talk to him about' this separation business.PRESIDENT:Right, that's right.EHRLICHMAN:He's very wise and very... PRESIDENT:I don't know how and we've got to get hisjudgment on it -But Bob said this morning(unintelligible) We have to (unintelligible) ourselves. We generally are hurting ourselves in this case. I guess we justhaven't been hard enough, have we? In asense though, let's face it, John Mitchell lurks in the back here -isn't that what it really gets down to? But God Almighty, weweren't protecting the White House now,right?EHRLICHMAN:That's correct.PRESIDENT:We weren't protecting that, we're protectingJohn Mitchell.EHRLICHMAN:Yes sir. PRESIDENT:All the way through.EHRLICHMAN:In the first instance we were protectingyour your re-election in a sense. We didn't know what from.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:Afterwards, though, this cover up businesswas pure Mitchell.PRESIDENT:Sure, now. Bob says that, you know, you're,you're going to look bad if he goes.EHRLICHMAN:Well, there are two ways of looking at that,obviously--APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.16PRESIDENT:Yeah, but the point is, there is that strongargument that people are making thatsomebody is the President, who, no, Isuppose, I (unintelligible) let's look at it this way, let's suppose I (unintelligible)it. The Dean argument will be that he toldme all these things about Haldeman and that I didn't move on it. Correct?EHRLICHMAN:Sure, and that, that Dean's being made ascapegoat.PRESIDENT:He's been made a scapegoat. And then, soall this about Haldeman comes out. Haldemanwould probably have to go, wouldn't he? Tobe quite candid.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, cause actually they'd drive him out. PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:You know.PRESIDENT:With this much in his case. EHRLICHMAN:It could be played a lot of different waysand back and forth.PRESIDENT:You've got--EHRLICHMAN:You've given me some stuff here-. PRESIDNET:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:...as a worry for him that we didn't havebefore that may add to this.PRESIDENT:Like what? EHRLICHMAN:Oh, this business about the dispute betweenStrachan and Magruder.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Uh, I think what I'll, what I'll do... Boband I, Bob and I talked about this atbreakfast, it was his idea...APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.17PRESIDENT:Yeah. What I was thinking was that Bob goesin the way of simply, I'm going out to fightthis battle, I will use my, my...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...my situation has been made untenable andI will fight this battle and so forth and soon.EHRLICHMAN:You know what he said? PRESIDENT:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:He said, "I'm gonna get Six Crises and I'mgonna read the chapter about the fund," andhe said, "That's going to be my guide."PRESIDENT:Separability is there, but then you've gotto think back as to what the hell Dean is up to with regard to you.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, and that's what we were doing when youcalled. We were going into everything andanything that I could remember, that had anything to do with this.PRESIDENT:Let me come down to the final point. As Ilook at it at the present time, looking atthis evidence, the U.S. Attorney would have a helluva time proving you were in theconspiracy (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Well, see, they're going over there whenthey get finished with this.PRESIDENT:I see, fine. Looking at this evidence Ithink there is a very strong possibilitythat Haldeman will be (unintelligible).EHRLICHMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Do you agree with that?APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.18EHRLICHMAN:Well, they seem to think so.PRESIDENT:They think so?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. Yeah.PRESIDENT:Looking at this evidence, too, however, Ithink there is a very little possibilitythat you would be if you would-ever beindicted -that you would be criminally indicted.EHRLICHMAN:Well, now, they say, though, that theprosecutor like this Kleinzer (phonetic),Gleazer (phonetic) or whatever (unintelligble) is, will sometimes indictsomebody that he doesn't expect to get aconviction on.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Just to get a big name into the case.PRESIDENT:Well, he's going to have enough big namesthis time.EHRLICHMAN:Well, that's another thing that they'regoing to probe.PRESIDENT:Sure.EHRLICHMAN:That they said to look after that. Don'ttake much comfort from the fact that...PRESIDENT:Well, if you're indicted, that's it.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible). Let me put it this way. Ido not see you (unintelligible).APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.19EHRLICHMAN:Well, I don't either.PRESIDENT:The second point on Bob, on the conspiracyis there a chance he'd be convicted? Do youthink so?EHRLICHMAN:Well, they say so far not from what they'veheard. They think not, that it is not, thatit is not actionable in the ultimate sense. But, they're being very guarded, obviously, because we're just now giving them the factsand they haven't tested what we're tellingthem.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible)...have to do is to start tobuild a web that Bob was involved in allthis...EHRLICHMAN:Sure. PRESIDENT:He rehired Liddy, who received the budget,he received the information...EHRLICHMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...and he ordered the three hundred andfifty G's. That's really the case on Bob,in a nut shell, isn't it?EHRLICHMAN:It would be, it would be a whole elaborateas you say, a web, of no one fact of whichwould do it.PRESIDENT:But I think even there, Bob, with a goodattorney, can beat it,EHRLICHMAN:Well, I think we've got the best in the townin there.PRESIDENT:Well, that's all I ask. EHRLICHMAN:Thank you. That was very helpful.APRIL 19, 1973, FROM 1:03 P.M., TO 1:30 P.M.20PRESIDENT:If its at all useful, let me say that I feelthat I -when you've finished with yourlawyers and so forth, maybe you and Bobwould like (unintelligible).ERHLICHMAN:All right, fine.PRESIDENT:You know, when you've got something likethis on your mind, you would just as soon talk about it. It's very helpful.EHRLICHMAN:Thank youPRESIDENT:The other thing too, that I'm tryingdesperately to keep, uh -the problem is, of course, John, as you know everybody(unintelligible) has come in(unintelligible) last night, talked to me about it, -I mean they all forgot things that I had thought over a million times. Idon't need to talk to Garment. I don't needto talk to Henry. I don't need to talk to Safire. Ziegler is worth quite a few. But don't you agreeEHRLICHMAN:Ron is great. Ron has been terrific inthis...PRESIDENT:Ron is really innocent. Talk aboutseparability. O.K. give them the judgment.
