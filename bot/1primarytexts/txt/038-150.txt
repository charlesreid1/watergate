He said well we might haveto have them twice then. I said that's allright. I said the main thing is I want them-I mean I really think your getting up there is, is important.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Soon. HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:You agree?HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Also it's a positive move we can, we canmake.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And, uh, it's at our initiative, you see. HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:And, uh--that's that.HALDEMAN:Okay. Good.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 6:57 p.m. TO 7:14 p.m.3PRESIDENT:And uh, the, uh--Now with regard to thepiece of paper I gave you on Ehrlichman,they have sent that you know out to the...HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...prosecutor. They had to do that for thisreason that, uh, that Dean basically,was--that was basically a little blackmail by him, on them, you see.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Uh, which they said if we didn't put itout--I mean if they didn't--they'd say why did you withhold it from the Ellsberg case,you see.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:So uh--but that is likely--it could come outI mean, Byrne may, Byrne may ask for,divulge the source, it will be Dean and Deanwill have to testify if he does, then that, uh, piece of thing, that Watergate buggers involved in the Ellsberg thing--it will notblow the Ellsberg case, in, you know, in, inhis opinion, due to the fact that it wasn't used. On the other hand, the fact of itwill come out. But I think that that wasgonna come out anyway, don't you feel so?HALDEMAN:Probably, probably. Yeah, and I think wegotta assume any of that stuff is.PRESIDENT:But the point isHALDEMAN:I'm not sure that's bad if it does. PRESIDENT:Well, Watergate...HALDEMAN:In among other things.PRESIDENT:Huh?APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 6:57 p.m. TO 7:14 p.m.4HALDEMAN:Well, it adds confusion to the whole thing.PRESIDENT:Yeah. The, uh, Watergate buggers, uh, tryto knock over Ellsberg's psychiatrist.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...Right. Well in any event, that was aboutit. So, uh, if you could uh, uh--call in toJohn. He wasn't home. If you tell the White House operator that you,...HALDEMAN:Right.PRESIDENT:...you call John, you talk to him and fillhim in. You sent him the piece of paper, did you, did you get it to him?HALDEMAN:I covered it with him, yeah.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:I'll give it to him in the morning. PRESIDENT:Um hmm. Um hmm. He understood thesignificance of it, of course.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Uh, did he see any other option? HALDEMAN:No. He, he--no. His only concern was thatit was getting fairly broad distribution.PRESIDENT:Well, I know. HALDEMAN:But, but...PRESIDENT:It's gonna get more broad distributionbecause they're gonna--they,...HALDEMAN:Yeah.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 6:57 p.m. TO 7:14 p.m.5PRESIDENT:...they, they uh, uh--you see, what, whatelse could I tell Kleindienst, forget it?Get my point?HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:I just couldn't do that.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And, uh you know, I could say look this isNational Security, and you cannot turn it over to 'em because Dean, another(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) obstruction of justice. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Exactly.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...Uh, the other point that it, uh, Iwent--I levelled with Petersen on the, uh, on all the conversation that we had and Isaid now I want you to know this and I saidwe'll not be blackmailed on it, we didn't do anything about it but, uh, that's when I started my investigation. And that's,that's our line there, I think. The moreI...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...the more I think of that, you know,I'm--I know that I'm in no illusions on it and incidentally I think that should just be between you and me.HALDEMAN:Okay.PRESIDENT:Or, uh, I think, I, I I don't, at this pointI don't think we oughta (unintelligible)that to John and have him worry about it andthe rest.HALDEMAN:Okay.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 6:57 p.m. TO 7:14 p.m.6PRESIDENT:Unless you want to.HALDEMAN:You mean the contents?PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:No. I didn't intend to. PRESIDENT:I think, ah, let's just ah, so that we canknow that, ah, in other words, ah, as far asthe conversation it's one that I had and that you had and...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...and ah, and ah, that ah, we'll just seewhat ah, if Dean wants to play that then we'll play it--for whatever its worth, ah,Pet--HALDEMAN:Did it bother Petersen? PRESIDENT:Oh well everything bothers him. HALDEMAN:(Laugh)PRESIDENT:But he said, he said1that Dean, he says, hasalways indicated he says he'll never, he says he'll do, deal, he won't lie for that God-damn Ehrlichman but he will of coursedefend the President da da da da and I saidwell, we'll see. But I said...HALDEMAN:Out to get John apparently, huh?PRESIDENT:Well, I think he&#8482;s out to save himself ifhe'll, he's gonna play every card that he can, and, ah, a desperate man he may wanna bring the President down too, but in thiscase then Bob, there's no, no other choiceit's to, to fight like hell. Ah this is ah, this is an evil man, you know. He knowsthat this was a legitimate thing to bedoing, he was deeply in it, and incidentally he's likely to be called as a witness in the Ellsberg case, too. I mean in the ah Bis,Vesco case because...APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 6:57 p.m. TO 7:14 p.m.7HALDEMAN:Dean is?PRESIDENT:Yeah, because apparently he made a telephonecall, it is alleged, in order to quash anindictment on the, allegedly against Vesco, so...HALDEMAN:Good Lord.PRESIDENT:Ah, is, that, is that the name Vesco, yeah. HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Yeah, so ah, (unintelligible) me on thatdamn thing, too.HALDEMAN:My God! Does Petersen still feel you can'tmake any move on Dean?PRESIDENT:Not at this point.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:Well, because he's, they're still trying toah, he's gonna try to make Dean's lawyerscome to him. You know? And ah, and ah...HALDEMAN:...and he's right. PRESIDENT:He's right. In other words, but let me say,there can't be any m-, move made on you and,you and/or Bob, uh or John, until the Deanthing's resolved and I, I, I made that damn clear to Petersen. I said I wasn't gonna,that I can't ah, I said I can't, I said you,you realize that if you, if I have these fellows resign I'm in effect saying "I judge them guilty," and I said no, any other wayof (unintelligible). I said if I do that, Isaid I have to do it, the right to do it with them and Dean and so forth and so on,you know I went through the whole drill andtold him that--I, sort of, sort of, uh, gave him the impression that I wasn't gonna do a damn thing, that I wanted to look over hispapers...APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 6:57 p.m. TO 7:14 p.m.8HALDEMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:Ya see what I mean?HALDEMAN:Yep.PRESIDENT:My own belief at this point is that, ah, foryours and John's information, that we justgotta stand God-damn firm today, tomorrow,Friday, the weekend, you know what I mean?HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:And, ah, the Ellsberg thing blows, 114 Ijust as soon, you know, just as...HALDEMAN:get it all out now. PRESIDENT:I wouldn't just as soon but I think it'sgonna come anyway. Whatever John Dean knowsis gonna come out, Bob.HALDEMAN:That's right. That's right. PRESIDENT:But ah, incidentally, I, you know, I alwayswondered about that taping equipment but I'mdamn glad we have it, aren't you?HALDEMAN:Yes sir, I think it's, it's, just one thingI went through today it was very helpful.PRESIDENT:Yes. It's helpful because while it has somethings in there that, ah,...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:we prefer we wouldn't have said but, on theother hand, we also have some things in there that we know we've, that I've said that weren't, that were pretty good, I mean.HALDEMAN:That's right.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 6:57 p.m. TO 7:14 p.m.9PRESIDENT:"This is wrong" and, ah, "blackmail" and"how much is this gonna cost!&#64258; and so forthand so on. Then, on the other hand, I saidwell "let's ah, we could get that, but how would you handle it." -But that, of course,those are all leading questions. I don'tknow how you analyze it but I don't know...HALDEMAN:I, I, I really don't think it, it would be,if it all gets, if that comes out, it's,it's another hard thing to explain but Ithink it's explainable.PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:And if, that I've, that I just think gainswell, I can't imagine that he'll do that, do that.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Except as he sees it...HALDEMAN:Petersen know what Dean's big bomb thingwas?PRESIDENT:No, he didn't. HALDEMAN:Was, wasn't he supposed to get some bigthreat from Dean or something?PRESIDENT:Well, he, he won't get that, Bob, until he,he meets with Dean and ah...HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:...and it hasn't occurred, I said, hedoesn't know when that'll occur.HALDEMAN:I see.PRESIDENT:I said, "well,"--so, he doesn't know. Isaid, "well, I just wanted to be sure. Maybe it's this--" I said, he thinks maybe it'ssome conversations he had with Dean, thatmay be but I, I think it's this, don't you?APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 6:57 p.m. TO 7:14 p.m.10HALDEMAN:I would, ah I don't know. I don't really.PRESIDENT:Maybe oh, what the hell else could it bethen, Bob? I mean, that if he's got a bigbomb, if he's gonna throw with his, ah, yeah, I think it's this, I would say thathe's gonna say, well, the President was, hetold the President about, ah, the, you know, that they're gonna pay these people off and so forth, and that John Mitchell and, Ithink he, the other thing is that JohnMitchell is, ah, in the presence of, ah, Haldeman and Ehrlichman, said that it hadbeen taken care of, or words to that effect.HALDEMAN:Mhmm. PRESIDENT:Is that right, is that, is I suppose hecould say that, right?HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And then it's his word against the rest ofyou right?HALDEMAN:Yeah. That's why you just you, I don't seehow, how we, (tape noise), the--there's noway you really can, can sta(tape noise) with Dean on this, I don't...PRESIDENT:No way. No, no, no, no way, no way. Youwanta, you wanta try to ah, ah, you see the only problem is that to handle it in such a way that he doesn't become, uh, totallyimplacable enemy.HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:Totally implacable and I think for thatreason handling the way I have, at leastmay, may...APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 6:57 p.m. TO 7:14 p.m.11HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:...may help in that respect. I, at least,have treated him decently. Ah, in fact,more decently than he deserves.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:On the other hand, ah, he ah, he may becometotally intractable, if he does, you're gonna have one hell of a pissing contestHALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:And, ah, on the other hand, ah...HALDEMAN:If you do, I, that's, you just, ya gotta winit.PRESIDENT:What else can you do, you know, really. Whatelse can you do. And you know when you think of this, all this kind of thing, you know, the, ah, when, when John ah, when ahJohn talks about, I was just thinking alittle bit more about the impeachment thing, that I don't see the Senate or any Senators starting an impeachment of the Presidentbased on the word of John Dean.HALDEMAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:That's all it is, you know, and, ah, I mean,John Dean says that this and that and theother thing happened.HALDEMAN:And there's no way he can support it. Imean there's no way to make a case.PRESIDENT:Well, except he could be, recorded hisconversation, you know, back, made a memorandum, told his lawyers immediatelythereafter and so forth and so on.HALDEMAN:Yeah.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 6:57 p.m. TO 7:14 p.m.12PRESIDENT:But, ah, even there, I mean, here is...HALDEMAN:Still his word, unless he's got a taperecording. Still his word unless he has atape recording.PRESIDENT:Mhmm.HALDEMAN:And even with the tape recording I think youcould make the case the other way.PRESIDENT:Mhmm.(Pause)PRESIDENT:I don't know, ah, a tape recording is, ah, Ican't believe that he could have walked in there with a tape recorder that day, becausethat day, I mean I'm not trying to bewishful thinking, that particular day, he wasn't really out to get the President, I don't thinkHALDEMAN:That's right, no sir, he wasn't. He was theexact, going just the other way.PRESIDENT:Tryin' to help? HALDEMAN:That's right, and I just can't conceive thathe would have, would have done that., 'CauseI was gonna (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Ah, unless he tape records every, does he,does he, does he tape record everything thathe comes in?HALDEMAN:No. No. PRESIDENT:Does he, you're sure of that?HALDEMAN:No, I'm not sure of it, but I am convi neverhad any reason to believe that he did.PRESIDENT:Mhmm, mhmm.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 6:57 p.m. TO 7:14 p.m.13HALDEMAN:And the way you know he dresses, uh justcasual enough in his clothing and all, thatI can&#8482;t imagine you'd (tape noise) held havetape recorder, ya, it's bulky and you gotta get it in your...PRESIDENT:Yeah.HALDEMAN:...pocket somewhere and all that. It isn'tall that easy to do..PRESIDENT:Right, right, right. In any event that'sthat, that's that. And ah, he, ah, so wedon't wanta borrow trouble. I mean we got enough without borrowing any, don't we?HALDEMAN:Yeah, yeah.PRESIDENT:And oh, ah let me say that, ah, this isApril 25th. We can figure that ah this is the day we start up. Seriously,...HALDEMAN:I think, that's right, I think...PRESIDENT:Ah, I don't mean, I don't think I'm beingPollyannish about it, I think that if, if Kleindienst with that damn thing, all right,my God, there it is. Put it out. And I,wouldn't hear your lawyers, we'd be sayin', I mean we, we can't go on this damn businessof, ah, resignation, now it isn't gonnawork. That's right, it just isn't gonna work right now. Uh, the, the, the leave of absence thing, ah, I don't know, you, withregard to you, do you really think that thatreally buys us anything?HALDEMAN:I don't know. It ah,...PRESIDENT:Well, we'll consider it. You'll have to,we'll have to think about it, in terms of ah, one other thing Steve told me today that he thought there was a chance that I wouldnot, maybe we could, I could get out ofdoing that damned finance dinner on May the 9th. Ah, he said that the tick--that theyhadn't had the, program wasn't going as wellas they expected and so forth and so on, is there a chance, ur...APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 6:57 p.m. TO 7:14 p.m.14HALDEMAN:I don't know. I, I--PRESIDENT:The new majority dinner so called...HALDEMAN:Yeah, it's probably...PRESIDENT:...and so forth. That's the thing I shouldavoid like the plague if I could but ah...HALDEMAN:Except that appearance, I would think, ifyou don't do it, they'll make a big thing out of they couldn't sell because of the Watergate and the President...PRESIDENT:I seeHALDEMAN:...wouldn't come. PRESIDENT:I see.HALDEMAN:Ah, that's my view now, I've, ah, I'm not sosure, I'm not sure of what the situation...PRESIDENT:They say they're not selling too manytickets someway or other but, I've heardthat at least, but you know we heard otherthings from Bush that they'd sold &#8218;em well.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:But ah, if it's there I could do it. Anotherthing I could do, is ah, rather than, thatis really just give a reception at the White House and shake hands for a couple hours.HALDEMAN:Mhmm.PRESIDENT:You know what I mean? As a, you know a, a,rather than going out and have to make speech...APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 6:57 p.m. TO 7:14 p.m.15HALDEMAN:Hah, yeah, the problem is the people that goto that dinner, the, your lobbyists and allthat stuffPRESIDENT:Right, that's right" that's all right butI'd hell of a lot rather be shaking theirhands, Bob, than, than to, ah...HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:...th-than to go out be making a politicalspeech that day, you know. What's apolitical speech without mentioningWatergate.HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:I think that's an option at least.HALDEMAN:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Mhmm. I plan to go to Mississippi Friday,you still for that, are you?HALDEMAN:Yes sir, absolutely.PRESIDENT:Yeah. HALDEMAN:By all means. PRESIDENT:And, ah...HALDEMAN:That's, that's all, all good, that one...PRESIDENT:Right. (Pause)(Pause)PRESIDENT:You know when you really stop to think ofit, in terms of this whole tings the, ah, the line basically of everybody, you know, Connally, Rogers, et al, which, of course,varies ah, I mean Harlow, the (tape noise)resignation line and so forth is a, is one that is, is so terribly attractive in terms,in, in, for a couple of days...(laughs)APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 6:57 p.m. TO 7:14 p.m.16HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:I mean, you know what I mean, this well nowthe President's finally started off with anew team but then for Christ sake's. ah, somethin&#8482; else blows, hah?HALDEMAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:On the other hand, ah, ah, the other line isto say, all right the grand jury's gonna hear it and they're gonna see it through. Imean to that point. That's a tenable linealso, isn't it?HALDEMAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Of course the problem with that I suppose isthat...HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:The problem with that is that, ah, what youcould say is that rather than the Presidentcleaning his house, the grand jury did. But in the sense, in the sense, if you wanta argue that we can say no, the President saidthat's the way to do it. You see my point?HALDEMAN:Yeah. And that, that is the point. Thatyou're the confidence in our institutionsand...PRESIDENT:Mhmm HALDEMAN:You know, the way things are supposed to bedone.PRESIDENT:That's right. We're presenting all thethings that's why the, that's why the appearance before the grand jury, the...HALDEMAN:Yeah.APRIL 25, 1973, FROM 6:57 p.m. TO 7:14 p.m.17PRESIDENT:...the going down there, and at mysuggestion and so forth and so on, that's,that line you and John might work out in themorning.HALDEMAN:All right.PRESIDENT:All right, you tell him not to have Johnreturn the call, you fill him in. Okay. Right, bye.HALDEMAN:Okay.
