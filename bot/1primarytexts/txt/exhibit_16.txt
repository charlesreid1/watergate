Go ahead onexecutive privilege, I suppos--How wouldyou, uh, how would you handle it, uh?MITCHELL:All I have worked out was&#8211; PRESIDENT:Work out the arrangements.MITCHELL:&#8211;the best formula that we've discussed.PRESIDENT:Well, I guess under the, under the, uh,under the situation that you, uh, under the statement that we have, we're in a positionto, to (unintelligible) I think we could,uh, we're in a position to, uh, negotiate with the Committee as to how, but we are notin a position to have, uh, to, uh, to crossthe bridge in terms of saying that Hunt and Liddy will go down and testify and that members ofMARCH 22, 1973 PROM 1:52 TO 3:43 P.M.16PRESIDENT:the White House staff will testify in open,(CONTINUED)public session, or something like that. Butyou've got a lot of other thingsEHRLICHMAN:Forma--PRESIDENT:other thing-- EHRLICHMAN:Formal is the word.PRESIDENT:Formally is the word I use.UNIDENTIFIED:U-- PRESIDENT:And incidentally, that's what I told Baker,too. I said, &#64257;Fine that's the term.&#64258;MITCHELL:On executive--PRESIDENT:We begin with that proposition--I'd becomfortable there--and see what you can getby with.MITCHELL:On executive privilege, Mr. President, staywell aware that some have waived it, and the more I think about it (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Yes.EHRLICHMAN:And it hurts the more you do it, the moreyou--MITCHELLThe more it's less, uh, (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Sherman Adams.MITCHELL:Uh, the point, uh, beyond which you might beable to work it out here.PRESIDENT:Yeah.--MITCHELL:The, uh, the point being that this seems tobe the only way in which you get involved (unintelligible)MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M.17PRESIDENT:You do.MITCHELL:I would, uh, lay out a formula and, uh,negotiate it with, with Sam Ervin or eitherthrough Baker or however else(unintelligible). And I would, I would also put together a damn good PR team.(Unintelligible) made available so that the,uh, the facts can be adduced without putting on a political road show.EHRLICHMAN:What about this? What about the President`steam? The team is important. Okay, I'vewritten this, I can see that Chapin, for instance, could appear, without it in anyway being germane to the Presidency. So I'mgoing to decide right now&#8211;UNIDENTIFIED:Bake-- EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;that--PRESIDENT:Not Baker, that'll be a little too--EHRLICHMAN:Well, whoever you talk to. Uh, I've got areport here and I think I see where the danger points are and where they aren't. I'dwant to reserve, obviously, as to anyquestion that might be asked.UNIDENTIFIED:Right.EHRLICHMAN:I can pinpoint some people now, but itreally wouldn't make any difference.HALDEMAN:John, do you admit there's any danger point?You admit that any one member of the WhiteHouse staff can testify because it's nodanger point for him, but that some other one can't because it's a danger point withhim. Then what you're saying is&#8211;MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M.18EHRLICHMAN:Well, but the first--(unintelligible)HALDEMAN:&#8211;then you're saying the President wasinvolved.EHRLICHMAN:I'm, I'm I'm saying danger in the sense ofthat he could, could, could--provocative.MITCHELL:But (unintelligible) for the sake of goingabout discussion, in other words that--Maybewe think that it's appropriate at this time to formalize John's theory on the Segretti matter and the Watergate matter based on thedocumentation from the FBI and(unintelligible) FBI (unintelligible) in other words based on--Can the Grand Jury--what we know came out of there, the trial(unintelligible) as far as that one incident-- whatever the record, uh, could have been available to me. This is why theinvestigation of--we had the memorandum withthe back-up-- you know, obviously the FBI after all (unintelligible) and so forth couldn't find anything more. It's notexpected that you could or (unintelligible)get out by way of their interrogation (unintelligible) uh, two memorandums fromDean is important (unintelligible)appropriate time with it. John did, and say I (unintelligible) all the public records (unintelligible).PRESIDENTWe've tried that though, John. Uh--DEAN:(Clears throat) Why won't--PRESIDENT:We still have grave doubts about it, though.DEAN:Well, I don't know--MITCHELL:I did too before, Mr. President. I, I hadsevere doubts about it. The, uh, now that, now that the facts have come out as have theFBI reports, and we have had the trial, thatyou have some documentation (unintelligible)MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M.19DEAN:I think the, uh, the proof is in thepudding' so to speak-it's how the document is written and until I sit down and writethat doc-I, I've done part "B" so to speak.I've done the Segretti thing&#8211;UNIDENTIFIED:Uh huh.DEAN:&#8211;Uh, and I am relatively satisfied that wedon't have any major problems with that. All right, as I go to part &#64257;A"--the Watergate--I haven't written--I haven't gone through theexercise yet, uh, in a real effort to writesuch a report and I really can't say if I can do it--where we are. And I, I think it'scertainly something that should be done,though&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:&#8211;and, uh, but we--MITCHELL:You never know--DEAN:You never know until we sit down and try todo it.PRESIDENT:Now, let me say on the Watergate, that's acase (unintelligible) Segretti(unintelligible)DEAN:We can't, we can't be as complete 'cause wedon't know. All we know is what, is whether-PRESIDENT:That's a question (unintelligible) EHRLICHMAN:It's a negative setting for us. PRESIDENT:In setting forth this general conclusionbased on (unintelligible) all thesequestions, You are--that based on all of your consideration, uh, all of youranalysis, and so forth, you, you're, youhave found and very carefully put down that this individual, that individual, thatMARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M.20PRESIDENT:individual, were not involved. We&#8482;re(CONTINUED)going (unintelligible) to have to presumethat. Rather than going into every leakedstory and other charge, et cetera, etcetera, et cetera, and knock this, this, this, this, this, this down--I don't, Idon't know--DEAN:Yeah, well that's why I'd like to like to--and I don't think I can do it until I sit down. This evening start drafting.PRESIDENT:Exactly.HALDEFIAN:I think you ought to hole up--now that you--for the weekend and do that.PRESIDENT:Sure.HALDEMAN:Let's put an end to your business and get itdone.PRESIDENT:I think you need a--that's right. Why don'tyou do this? Why don't you go up to CampDavid? And, uh&#8211;DEAN: I might do that; I might do that. A place toget away from the phone.PRESIDENT:&#8211;Completely away from the phone and soforth. Just go up there and, uh (unintelligible) I don't know what kind workthis is, but I agree that that's what youcould--see what you come up with. You would have in mind and assume that we've got some sort of a document (unintelligible) and thenthe next step once you have written it youwill have to continue to defend (unintelligible) action.EHRLICHMAN:That would be my scenario, that, that hepresents it to you as, at, at your request. And, uh, you then publish it.DEAN:Well, that, that's--MITCHELL:That introduces the problem for us(unintelligible)MARCH 22, 1973 FRO' t 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M.21DEAN:--trial.MITCHELL:criminal trial and then appeals which may--EHRLIC1iMAN:I, I know that, but I don't care.DEAN:Well you ought to be-- HALDEMAN:I don't see why. You're not dealing with thedefendant's trial. You're only dealing withthe White House involvement. You're not dealing with the campaign.DEAN:That's where I first (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Well, you can write, you could write it in a way&#8211;UNIDENTIFIED:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:&#8211;you could write it in a way that you saythis report does not re--, it's not, not, will not comment upon and so forth and so forth, but, "I--as, as you directed, Mr.President, and without at all compromisingthe rights of defendants and so forth, some of which are on appeal, here are the facts with regard to members of the White Housestaff, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,which you have asked from me. I have checked the FBI records; I have read the Grand Jurytestimony and this is it--these are myconclusions, chit, chit, chit, chit.&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:As a matter of fact you could say, "I, Iwill not summarize some of the FBI reportsin this document because it is myunderstanding that you may wish to publish this." Or, or you can allude to it in thatway without saying that flatly. You can saythat "I do not summarize all the FBI documents in this report."DEAN:Or I could say that all of the FBI (clearsthroat) it is my understanding that all theFBI reports have been turned over to theMARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M.22DEAN:Ervin Committee. Another, another(CONTINUED)vehicle might--HALDEMAN:And, and he has only seen half of them.DEAN:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Oh, yeah. DEAN:Another vehicle might be, take the report Iwrite and give it to Ervin and Baker&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah. DEAN:&#8211;uh, under the same terms that, uh, they'regetting the FBI reports. Say, "Now, this hasinnuendo in it, little things the presswould leak from this and assume things that shouldn't be assumed. But I want you to knoweverything we know." And publicly state thatyou've turned over a Dean Report to the Ervin Committee. And then begin to say--the next step is, "I think that you can see thatvarious people have various ingredientswhere they may be of assistance in testifying. But it is not worth their coming up here to be able to repeat really what ishere in some forum where they are going tobe, uh, treated like they are in a circus. But I am also willing, based on thisdocument, to set some ground rules for howwe have these people appear before your Committee.&#64258;EHRLICHMAN:A case in point: the issue of whether or notI had a phone call reporting the burglary.DEAN:Right. EHRLICHLIAN:Now, that's all I know about the damn thingis that the Secret Service, or somepoliceman phoned.DEAN:But they could go on forever with you onthat.EHRLICHMAN:ExactlyMARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M.23DEAN:And I think it ought to be things like we'vegot in, in this report and this might be, you know, get, give it to Ervin on theconfidence that we're not talking aboutdocuments being released. We're talking about something that's entirely facts. Youcould even (unintelligible) write a(unintelligible)PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) accomplish our purpose ifit isn't released.DEAN:I think it, I think it--PRESIDENT:And I, I thought the purpose--I thoughtJohn's concern (intelligible) I guess you'dwant him for me to--DEAN:I do, I-- EHRLICHMAN:My thought is-- PRESIDENT:In other words, rather than fighting it,we're not, we're not fighting the Committee-- we are, of course--but whatwe're fighting is a public relations battle.EHRLICHMAN:And I am looking to the future, assumingthat some corner of this thing comes unstuckat some time, you're then in a position to say, &#64257;'Look, that document I published isthe document I relied on, that's the reportI relied on and it codified and included all the secret, uh, identification of the FBI&#8211;"PRESIDENT:This is all we knew.HALDEMAN:All the stuff we could find out-EHRLICHMAN:&#64257;&#8211;And now, this new development is asurprise to me, and I'm going to fire A, B,C, and D--now.&#64258;DEAN:John, let me just raise this. If you takethe document publicly, the first thing thatMARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3 43 P.M.23aDEAN:happens is the press starts asking(CONTINUED)Ziegler about it, inspecting the documenteach day. &#64257;Well, why did Ehrlichman receivethe call? How did they happen to pick outEhrlichman?"PRESIDENT:That's right.DEAN:&#64257;Uh, what did he do wit the informationafter he got it?" Uh, so on. Each, every item can be a full day of quizzing.UNIDEI1TIFIED:Yeah.DEAN:They'll just go through the document dayafter day after day.MITCHELL:Now what is your concerned judgement as towhen and under what circumstances--PRESIDENT:Another thing--However, MITCHELL:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:let me say, that while Ziegler could begiven all those questions, I would say thoseare questions--I think Ziegler should cut it off.MITCHELL:Let it die.PRESIDENT:This--Yeah, fine. I think there should be acut-off point which (unintelligible). If John just sort of (unintelligible) I'm notgoing to comment on the basic questions thatare properly before the Committee on the (unintelligible)DEAN:Well, you, you've said you are going tocooperate with a proper investigation.PRESIDENT:Yeah, but I'm not going to comment on itwhile it is proper.DEAN:That`s right.MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57. TO 3:43 P.M.24PRESIDENT:As long as it's proper.DEAN:So why would you, why not put ourselves in aframework where you're way out above it?You're cooperating with this Committee;you've turned over the materials&#8211;PRESIDENT:And then, no further comment.DEAN:&#8211;and no further comment.PRESIDENT:You see, I think you could get off with theZiegler business. I don't want Ziegler--I, I was trying to pull Ziegler off of that by myown statement, too (Unintelligible)cooperate with the Committee, give full cooperation, but we're not going to commentwhile the matter is being considered by theCommittee&#8211;HALDEMAN:But you don't say,PRESIDENT:&#8211;unless the Committee does this and that.HALDEMAN:but you don't say that people don't give,don't release, don't publish the, uh, Dean report. Only hand it over--DEAN:--to a proper investigative committee.PRESIDENT:Well, then if you turn over the, do that,though, then can we get anything out about the, uh, Republicans putting out that muchof a report? Uh, can we still get out thefact that&#8211;EHRLICHMAN:Well, the President-- PRESIDENT:&#8211;there has been a report in which everybodyin the White House--which bears out thePresident's--HALDEMAN:Ron can make the statement.MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M.25DEAN:That's rightHALDEMAN:That the President--(SeveralVoices)(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:John wants the statement-- EHRLICHMAN:Another way to do this, and that would befor you to have a meeting with Ervin andBaker.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:That would--I told them--PRESIDENT:Well, we've thought of that, I mean, we'vethought of that and we've tried it.EHRLICHMAN:But, but we didn't have a reason for themeeting. This would be for the purpose ofturning over the document and discussing the ground rules. Uh, before you did that you want to have that all agreed in advance asto what the ground rules would be. And,you've got quid pro quo here because you could come to, to Baker, and you could come to the Committee or to Ervin direct, andsay, &#64257;Look, I'll turn over the Dean reportto you, provided we can agree, uh, on how witnesses will be treated up there.&#64258; I can,I can even, uh, construe, uh&#8211;PRESIDENT:Right.EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;executive privilege.PRESIDENT:John, for example, if you were, uh, justtalking about executive privilege, this,this really gets down to the specifics in terms of the question what do you do whenthey say, &#64257;What about Colson?&#64258; Does he go ornot?MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:52 TO 3:43 P.M.26MITCHELL:I think that Colson goes.PRESIDENT:He has to go? UNIDENTIFIED:Right.MITCHELL:I think Colson--HALDEMAN:Everybody goes under John's--includingEhrlichman and me--everybody except JohnDean, who doesn't go because he's, he's gotthe lawyer privilege.MITCHELL:I think what is happening to you and Johnand so forth with the Committee could benegotiated out of the contents of thisreport.PRESIDENT:We should negotiate it how?MITCHELL:The President's report will show that, uh,your simple thought--your simple involvement was missing in the pub bill.HALDEMAN:No, it would show more on my book, I'mafraid.DEAN:But, they'll still, they'll still--Onestrong argument--HALDEMAN:Let us, let us go.DEAN:Yeah.HALDEMAN:I, I, I don't see any argument against ourgoing if you are going to let anybody go.DEAN:That's right.HALDEMAN:Let us go. But on the condition--you getless trouble with us than you do with some of the others. And if it's not--and, nowsure if you get, if you get the big fish upthere in front of the television cameras, yes, I think that would be tough. I thinkStrachan going up wouldn't get them nearlyMARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:52 TO 3:43 P.M.27HALDEMAN:as excited as, as John and me going up(CONTINUED) PRESIDENT:That's Strachan and Chapin.HALDEMAN:Well, Chapin wouldn't have to appear&#8211;DEAN:Well-- HALDEMAN:&#8211;as a focal point, but, but, uh, uh, Ithink, if you could do it in executivesession, uh--UNIDENTIFIED:Then I would (unintelligible) HALDEMAN:Then, then why hold us back?PRESIDENT:The executive session thing has alwaysappealed to me. Now of course, you could say, &#64257;Well, in terms of people coming uphere, of course you have to (unintelligible)session, but you got to convin--, the Committee feels constrained under executive session--DEAN:We can invite the Committee down to theRoosevelt Room, or the Blair House.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah. MITCHELL:Oh hell, you could--PRESIDENT:Yeah, you could set it at a different venue,that's true. You could put it in a different place. You could say we--which is what I--MITCHELL:That would be hard to negotiate.HALDEMAN:Can, can we maintain informality? EHRLICHMAN:It will never--it would never fly. UNIDENTIFIED:Never fly.HALDEMAN:Yeah, I don't know why not. Those others goup there.MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:52 TO 3:43 P.M.28UNIDENTIFIED:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Well, would executive session fly? EHRLICHMAN:Executive session, I suspect, would at thispoint, yes, sir, yeah, I, I really thinkthese guys are concerned about this Mexican standoff that they've got, and I thinkthey're--PRESIDENT:They'll also-- EHRLICHMAN:I think that, that, the, uh--Ervin's crackon television about arresting people crossedthe line.PRESIDENT:Right. EHRLICHMAN:That would take it quite a bit far.MITCHELL:In addition to that you have the problem ofthe long lengthy litigation.PRESIDENT:It's going to go on for a hell of a longtime.HALDEMAN:Ervin doesn't want that.DEAN:Let him take it on the counsel, then. HALDEMAN:That's what he doesn't want. DEAN:I know, but let him, if, if, he uh--HALDEMAN:We have offered to do it on Dwight Chapin.That's the easy one for him.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.HALDEMAN:You got some guy who had no contact withthis (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:It was quite, it was quite clear to me that,it was quite clear to me that, uh, as long,as long as Dean--MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:52 TO 3:43 P.M.29HALDEMAN:Won't they test it?PRESIDENT:No, they didn't test it. We asked them to-- UNIDENTIFIED:Find out.PRESIDENT:He said let's find out. They didn't bitethat one very fast, did they John?HALDEMAN:Chapin&#8482;s the guy they'd test it on. You tryto hold privilege on Chapin and that's onethey'd go to Court on. They, They'd--PRESIDENT:Probably. HALDEMAN:You might do pretty well, because here's aformer employee, a guy who had no policyrole, had no&#8211;PRESIDENT:--contact--HALDEMAN:&#8211;major contact with the President, and he'dhave a hell of a time demonstrating--MITCHELL:Obviously you'll have to expect a subpoena. PRESIDENT:Chapin?MITCHELL:Yeah, because he's no longer employed.HALDEMAN:Well, because, PRESIDENT:What I'd-- HALDEMAN:because with the subpoena, if he's called totestify regarding his appointment, but not,not regarding his--any present stuff.MITCHELL:He doesn't (unintelligible) legroom. Theycan get him up there.EHRLICHMAN:Well, the precedent&#8211; UNIDENTIFIED:I, I, I--MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:52 TO 3:43 P.M.30EHRLICHMAN:&#8211;on this is interesting. I think that hislawyer would advise him to go.UNIDENTIFIED:Couldn't get anything, couldn't do anything(unintelligible)MITCHELL:They could get him to talk. PRESIDENT:We would have to express the trust--In thecase of a present White House employee theycouldn't get him up here, right?MITCHELL:Right. PRESIDENT:In the case of a past one you could get himup, but then he could, then he would have togo in front of the cameras and say, "I will not because of executive privilege."MITCHELL:Well, they can get up with him.EHRLICHMAN:But it's your privilege--you interpose it. PRESIDENT:I see. EHRLICHMAN:And, and, uh, first we have the, the anomalyof Clark Mollenhoff running up and, and, uh,trying to give testimony in a civil service area over here now. He's running up saying, "Ask me a question, ask me a question, thisis a kangaroo court, and, and I waive--" Thehearing examiner just says, "Sit down and shut up." And what's happening is that,that, the, uh, government is asserting theexecutive privilege.MITCHELL:No, they are not. EHRLICHMAN:Well--MITCHELL:Not executive privilege.EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, all right-- MITCHELL:In fact you have--MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:52 TO 3:43 P.M.31UNIDENTIFIED:(Unintelligible) executive--EHRLICHMAN:All right. It's the closest thing to it. Butthe point is, who's privilege is it toassert? Now, what do you do if it's Chapin?I think, I, I haven't thought this--this is the reason I called you here to figure outwhat the scenario is--but I assume whatwould happen is that immediately the subpoena issued, that, that on behalf of the President a letter would go to the Committeesaying the Executive asserts privilege.PRESIDENT:Let me ask this. Uh, the, this question isfor John Ehrlichman and, uh, Dean. Uh, youwere the two who felt the strongest, uh, onthe executive privilege thing (unintelligible). If I am not mistaken, you thought we ought to draw the line where wedid (unintelligible). Have you changed yourmind now?DEAN:No sir, I think it's a. I think it's aterrific statement. It's--It, it puts youjust where you should be. It's got enoughflexibility in it. It's--PRESIDENT:But now-what--all that John Mitchell isarguing then, is that now we, we useflexibility&#8211;DEAN:That's correct. PRESIDENT:&#8211;in order to get on-- with the coverup plan.EHRLICHMAN:And, as I told him, I am, am so convincedwe're right on the statement that I have never gone beyond that. He argues that we'rebeing hurt badly by the way it's beinghandled. And I am willing--let's see--MITCHELL:That&#8482;s the point.HALDEMAN:I think that's a valid evaluation, I think(unintelligible)MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:52 TO 3:43 P.M.32MITCHELL:See, that's the only point, the only point&#8211;HALDEMAN:Yeah. MITCHELL:&#8211;where the President--HALDEMAN:That's where you look like you're coveringup right now. That's the only thing, the only active step you've taken to cover upthe Watergate all along.PRESIDENT:That's right. DEAN:What is? HALDEMAN:Was that.PRESIDENT:Ev--, even though we've offered tocooperate.HALDEMAN:To the extent--and on legal grounds, and,and precedent&#8211;PRESIDENT:That's right. HALDEMAN:&#8211;and tradition, and constitutional groundsand all that stuff you, you're just fine,but to the guy sitting at home who watchesJohn Chancellor say that the President is covering this up by re--, this historic review blankets the widest exercise ofexecutive privilege in American history, andall that. He says, "What the hell's he covering up? If he's got no problem whydoesn't he let them go and talk?"MITCHELL:And it relates to the Watergate, it doesn'trelate to Henry Kissinger&#8211;HALDEMAN:That's right.MITCHELL:&#8211;or foreign affairs.HALDEMAN:That's right. Precedent and all thatbusiness-they don't know what you're talkingabout.MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M.42[Part III]DEAN:You know, when the final wire is drawn-- MITCHELL:Well, it's appropriate for the President'scounsel to be present when the discussions takeplace.DEAN:That's right. ***********PRESIDENT:Well, all right. Now let's, let's get downto the question: How do we want to do this? How do we start there?DEAN:I would think that possibly Kleindienst, uh,ought to call today, uh, and let Ervin andBaker know if he would like to meet with them early next week to talk about executiveprivilege uh, indicate that I would bepresent to see if we can find&#8211;PRESIDENT:A formula for&#8211; DEAN:&#8211;a formula to resolve--PRESIDENT:&#8211;getting the information that they desireDEAN:That's right. HALDEMAN:It's an unpublicized meeting. DEAN:Unpublicized.PRESIDENT:I think we'd, uh (unintelligible) go ahead.HALDEMAN:(Unintelligible) on top of that. I would sayearly in the week, you better say Monday soyou can get them before the Committee meets.MITCHELL:And, naturally cover Watergate first. PRESIDENT:I don't know how far Ervin's going to go,uh-- Ervin's insistence on letting Deantestity-whether he might. We'd have to drawa line there, wouldn't we John?MITCHELL:I would agree wholeheartedly that you betternot go back on your final statements on thesubject.MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:5' TO 3:43 P.M.43PRESIDENT:That's right. That's right.UNIDENTIFIED:Even if there hadn't been statements-- PRESIDENT:That's right. But the point is, we've got toaccept the decision of Judge Byrnes(unintelligible) on the bail. The other thing to do on the Dean thing is say--you'dsimply say, ''Now, that's out. Dean has--hemakes the report. Here's everything Dean knows.''DEAN:Right.PRESIDENT:That's where, that's why the Dean report iscritical.EHRLICHMAN:I think, John, on Monday could say to Ervinif that, uh, question comes up, "I, I knowthe President's mind on this. He's adamant about my testifying as such. At the same time he has always indicated that the fruitsof my investigation will be available.'' Andjust leave it at that for the moment.DEAN:One issue that may come up as the hearingsgo along, if it then becomes a focus, is,what did Dean do? Uh, as you all know I wasover--all over this thing like a wet blanket. I was everywher--everywhere theylook they are going to find Dean.PRESIDENT:Sure. DEAN:Uh-- HALDEMAN:That's perfectly proper.DEAN:But it, but--I don't think that's bad.EHRLICHMAN:I don't know. I was supposed to be. PRESIDENT:You were on it at the first. You weredirected by the President to get me all thefacts. Second, as White House Counsel you were on it for the purpose of, of representing any people in the ExecutiveBranch who were beingMARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:5, TO 3:43 P.M.44PRESIDENT(CONTINUED):questioned on it. So you were there for thepurpose of getting information. In otherwords, that was your job. Correct?DEAN:That's right.PRESIDENT:Then you heard--But, but the main point isthat you can certainly tell them that Dean had absolutely no operational--The wonderful thing about your position is, I think, asfar as they're concerned-Watergate--is yourposition's one of, of truly of counsel. It is never, never as an operator. That's the--HALDEMAN:You can even--In the private sessions, then,maybe, maybe, volunteer to give them a statement on the, the whole question of your recommendation of Liddy which is the onlypossible kind of substantive involvementthat you could have and, and in that you can satisty one of those arguments.PRESIDENT'(Unintelligible)HALDEMAN:And that you--it you wanted to.PRESIDENT:At the, at the President's direction, you'veneve done anything, any operational, youwere always, always just as counsel, alwaysjust as counsel. Well, we've got to keep you out anyway: the Dean thing. I guess we just draw the line, so we give them some of it--not give them all of it. I don't supposethey'd say, John--"No, we don't take him in executive session.'' Would he go up inpublic session? What would your feeling onthat be? -MITCHELL:I wouldn't let him go. PRESIDENT:You wouldn't.MITCHELL:I would not.PRESIDENT:Why not? You just take the heat of being--uh, all right. How about you wouldn't--buton theMARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M.45PRESIDENT(CONTINUED):other hand you'd let Chapin go. And you'dlet Colson go.HALDEMAN:No, he doesn't.PRESIDENT:Because they're former White House people. MITCHELL:You can't keep them out of all thosesessions. Now, I want to get back to that(unintelligible) Dean, Colson and Chapin; on the basis of that Chapin talked to Segrettl last weekend.DEAN:Well, they can subpoena any of us. There'sno doubt about that. Uh, they, they, if they don't serve us here because they can't getin, they can serve me at home or somewhere.They can ultimately find you.EHRLICHMAN:I'm going to move to Camp David. PRESIDENT:Right.HALDEMAN:By helicopter. (Laughter)PRESIDENT:Go ahead. (Unintelligible) DEAN:So, the question is once you're served andyou decline, then you've got a contemptsituation. Now, I would say that it, it, itgets very difficult (sighs) to believe that they'll go contempt on people who--PRESIDENT:Present White House staff.DEAN:Present White House staff. PRESIDENT:They would on Colson. They could do that,could they?DEAN:That would be a good test case for them togo on. Uh, the other thing is, though, they could sub--, subpoena Colson to come upthere and Colson could then say, ''Well, I,I decline to testify on the basis that I think this is aMARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:5, TO 3:43 P.M.46DEAN(CONTINUED):privileged communication, uh, or privilegedactivities.'' And again, if you had Colson,it's a little, a little fuzzier as towhether or not you--MITCHELL:I'd rather not answer the question that'sasked.DEAN:That's right. MITCHELL:See my point. DEAN:That's right. There it, then it would getmuch fuzzier as, as to whether or not theycite him for contempt or not.PRESIDENT:Suppose the Judge tomorrow, uh, orders theCommittee to show, show its evidence to theGrand Jury (unintelligible) then the Grand Jury reopens the case and questions everybody. Does that change the game plan?DEAN:(Unintelligible) send them all down.PRESIDENT:What? Before the Committee? MITCHELL:The President's asked (unintelligible) this. DEAN:Now are you saying--PRESIDENT:Suppose the Judge opens--tells the GrandJury and says, ''I, I don`t,&#64258; says, ''I want them to call Haldeman, Ehrlichman andeverybody else they didn't call before.''What do you say to that? Then do you still go on this pattern with the Ervin Committee? The point, is, if, if a grand jury, uh,decides to go into this thing, uh, what doyou think on that point?EHRLICHMAN:I think you'd say, "Based on what I knowabout this case, uh, I can see no reason whyI should be concerned about what the grand jury process--"PRESIDENT:All right.EHRLICHMAN:That's all.MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M. 47HALDEMAN:And that would change--PRESIDENT:Well, they go in--do both: Appear before theGrand Jury and the Committee?DEAN:Sure.EHRLICHMAN:You have to bottom your defense, yourposition on the report.PRESIDENT:That's right.EHRLICHMAN:And the report says, "Nobody was involved,&#64258;&#8211; PRESIDENT:That's right.

DEAN:Well, there are no rules.PRESIDENT:The rules of evidence before grand juriesare not pretty fair at this point.DEAN:That's right.MITCHELL:Uh, when you have something that's, uh,reasoned and controlled--PRESIDENT:Yeah.

DEAN:I think we've had a good go-round on--PRESIDENT:You think, you think we want to, want to gothis route now? And the--let it hang out, so to speak?DEAN:Well, it's, it isn't really that--HALDEMAN:It's a limited hang out.DEAN:It's a limited hang out. EHRLICHMAN:It's a modified limited hang out. PRESIDENT:Well, it's only the questions of the thinghanging out publicly or privately.DEAN:What it's doing, Mr. President, is gettingyou up above and away from it. And that'sthe most important thing.PRESIDENT:Oh, I know. But I suggested that the otherday and we all came down on, uh, remember we came down on, uh, on the negative on it.

I thought we had aboy here. No, you, uh, John, uh, carried avery, very heavy load. Uh, both Johns as amatter of fact, but, uh, I was going to say uh, uh, John Dean is, uh (unintelligible)got-- put the fires out, almost got the damnthing nailed down till past the election and so forth. We all know what it is. Embarrassing God damn thing the way it went,and so forth. But, in my view, uh, some ofit will come out; we will survive it. That's the way it is. That's the way you've got tolook at it.DEAN:We were within a few miles months ago, but,uh, we're--PRESIDENT:The point is, get the God damn thing overwith.DEAN:That's right. PRESIDENT:That's the thing to do. That's the otherthing that I like about this. I'd like toget--But you really would draw the line on--But, I know, we can't make a complete cave and have the people go up there and testify.You would agree on that?MITCHELL:I agree. PRESIDENT:You agree on that, John? DEAN:It we're in the posture of everything shortof giving them a public session(unintelligible) and the whole deal. You're not hiding anything.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Particularly if, particularly if wehave the Dean statement.DEAN:And they've been given out. PRESIDENT:And your view about the Dean statement is togive that to the Committee and not make itpublic, however.MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:5' TO 3:43 P.M.63DEAN:That's correct, I think that`s--PRESIDENT:And say it's, uh-- MITCHELL:Give it to the Committee for the purpose--PRESIDENT:--the purpose of their investigation.MITCHELL:(Unintelligible) to limit the number ofwitnesses&#8211;PRESIDENT:Yeah.MITCHELL:&#8211;which are called up there, instead of abuck-shot operation.PRESIDENT:And say here, and also say, &#64257;This may helpyou in your investigation.&#64258;MITCHELL:Right. PRESIDENT:&#64258;This is everything we know, Mr. Senator.&#64258;That's what I was preparing to say. &#64257;This iseverything we know; I know nothing more. This is the whole purpose, and that's that. If you need any further information, my, ourcounsel will furnish it, uh, that is not inhere.&#64258; It'd be tempting to-&#64257;But this is all we know. Now, in addition to that, you are welcome to have, have people, but you've gotto have-&#64257; I think that the best way to haveit is in executive session, but incidentally, you say executive session forthose out of government as well as in?MITCHELL:That's right. PRESIDENT:Chapin and Colson should be called in. DEAN:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:I would think so.MITCHELL:Sure. Because you have the same problem. PRESIDENT:You see, we ask--but your point--we ask for,uh,MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1: ~ TO 3:43 P.M.64PRESIDENT(CONTINUED):the privilege, and at least, you know, we,we, our statement said it applies to formeras well as present (unintelligible)DEAN:Now, our statement--you leave a lot offlexibility that you normally--for onething, taking the chance appearing, and uh,however, informal relationships will always be worked out (unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Informal relations.DEAN:That's right.MITCHELL:You have the same basis-- PRESIDENT:Well, it might. When I say that, that, that-the written, interrogatory thing is not asclear (unintelligible) maybe Ervin is makingit that way, but I think that's based onwhat maybe, uh, we said that the--I don'tthink I said we would only write, in, in thepress conference, written interrogatories.DEAN:That's right. I don't think-- PRESIDENT:I didn't say that at all.DEAN:Ervin Just jumped to that conclusion as aresult of my letter to, uh--PRESIDENT:I think that's what it was.DEAN:I think that's what's happened.PRESIDENT:Not that your letter was wrong--it wasright. But, uh, the whole written interrogatory, we didn't discuss otherpossibilities.MITCHELL:With respect to your ex-employees, you havethe same problem of getting into areas ofprivileged communications. You certainly canmake a good case for keeping them in executive session.MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M.65PRESIDENT:That's right.MITCHELL:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:And, and in this sense the precedent forworking--you can do it in cases in thefuture, Let's do it in executive session, and then the privilege can be raised withouthaving uh, on a legal basis, without havingthe guilt by the Fifth Amendment, not like pleading the Fifth Amendment--MITCHELL:Right.PRESIDENT:--the implication always being raised.MITCHELL:(Unintelligible). and self-protection inthat view? -PRESIDENT:What? Yeah.DEAN:(Unintelligible) Fifth Amendment. PRESIDENT:That`s right. That's what we're going to dohere.MITCHELL:Those--boy, this thing has to be turnedaround. Got to get you off the lid.PRESIDENT:Right. DEAN:All right.PRESIDENT:All right, fine Chuck.MITCHELL:Good to see you. PRESIDENT:How long were you in Florida? Just, uh--MITCHELL:I was down there overnight. I was four hourson the witness stand testifying for the government in these, uh, racket cases involving wiretapping. The God damn foolJudge down there let them go all over thelot and ask me any questions that they wanted to. Just ridiculous. You know, thishad, all has to doMARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M.66MITCHELL(CONTINUED):with the discretionary act of signing apiece of paper that I'm authorized by thestatute. There were twenty-seven hoodlawyers that questioned me.PRESIDENT:You know, uh, the, uh, you, you can say whenI (unintelligible) I was going to say thatthe, uh--(Picks up phone) Can you get me Prime Minister Trudeau in Canada, please. (Hangs up) I was going to say that Dean hasreally been, uh, something on this.MITCHELL:That he has, Mr. President, no questionabout it, he's a very--PRESIDENT:Son-of-a-bitching tough thing.MITCHELL:You've got a very solid guy that's handledsome tough things. And, I also want to say these lawyers that you have think veryhighly of him. I know that John spends histime with certain ones--PRESIDENT:Dean's discipline is very high. MITCHELL:Parkinson, O'Brien.PRESIDENT:Yes, Dean says it's great. Well, you know Ifeel for all the people, you know. I mean everybody that's involved. Hell, is allwe're doing is their best to(unintelligible) and so forth. (Unintelligible). That's, that's why I can't let you go, go down. John? It's all right.Come in.DEAN:Uh-- PRESIDENT:Did you find out anything?DEAN:I was, I went over to Ziegler's office. Theyhave an office over there. Paul O'Brien'll be down here in a little while to see you. I'm going over to Ziegler's office andfinish this up now.MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:5, TO 3:43 P.M.67MITCHELL:Are you coming back?DEAN:Yes, I'll come back over here then.MITCHELL:Okay.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Well, when you come back--he can, uh,is that office open for John now?DEAN:Yes.PRESIDENT:Then he can go over there as soon (unintelligible) this. But, uh, the, uh, theone thing I don't want to do is to--Now letme make this clear. I, I, I thought it was,uh, very, uh, very cruel thing as it turned out-- although at the time I had to tell(unintelligible)--what happened to Adams. Idon't want it to happen with Watergate--the Watergate matter. I think he made a, made a mistake, but he shouldn't have been sacked,he shouldn't have been--And, uh, for thatreason, I am perfectly willing to--I don't give a shit what happens. I want you all to stonewall it, let them plead the FifthAmendment, cover-up or anything else, ifit'll save it--save the plan. That's the whole point. On the other hand, uh, uh. Iwould prefer, as I said to you, that you doit the other way. And I would particularly prefer to do it that other way if it's going to come out that way anyway. And that myview, that, uh, with the number of jackasspeople that they've got that they can call, they're going to--The story they get outthrough leaks, charges, and so forth, andinnuendos, will be a hell of a lot worse than the story they're going to get out by just letting it out there.MITCHELL:Well--PRESIDENT:I don't know. But that's, uh, you know, upto this point, the whole theory has beencontainment, as you know, John.MITCHELL:Yeah.43MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M.68PRESIDENT:And now, now we're shifting. As far as I'mconcerned, actually from a personalstandpoint, if you weren't making a personalsacrifice--it's unfair--Haldeman and Dean. That's what Eisenhower--that's all he caredabout. He only cared about--Christ, "Be surehe was clean." Both in the fund thing and the Adams thing. But I don't look at it that way. And I just--That's the thing I amreally concerned with. We're going toprotect our people, if we can.MITCHELL:Well, the important thing is to get you upabove it for this first operation. And thento see where the chips fall and, uh, and, uh, get through this Grand Jury thing up here. Uh, then the Committee is anotherquestion. (Telephone rings) What we ought tohave is a reading as to what is (Telephone rings) coming out of this Committee and we, if we handle the cards as it progresses.(Telephone rings)PRESIDENT:Yeah. But anyway, we'll go on. And, uh, Ithink in order--it'll probably turn just aswell, getting them in the position of, eventhough it hurts for a little while.MITCHELL:Yeah. PRESIDENT:You know what I mean. People say, &#64257;Well, thePresident's (unintelligible),&#64258; and so forth.Nothing is lasting. You know people get so disturbed about (unintelligible).MITCHELL:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Now, when we do move (unintelligible) we canmove, we can move, in a, in a, in a, in the proper way.MITCHELL:If you can do it in a controlled way itwould help and good, but, but, but the otherthing you have to remember is that thisstuff is going to come out of thatCommittee, whether--PRESIDENT:That's right.MITCHELL:And it is going to come out no matter what.MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:5, TO 3:43 P.M.69PRESIDENT:As if, as if I, and then it looks like Itried to keep it from coming out.MITCHELL:That's why it's important that thatstatement go up to the Committee.PRESIDENT:(Picks up phone) Hello. (pause) I don't wantto talk. Sure. (Hangs Up) Christ. Sure,we'll--MITCHELL:It's like these Gray, Gray hearings. Theyhad it five days running that the files wereturned over to John Dean, just five daysrunning--the same story.PRESIDENT:Same story, right. -MITCHELL:And the files should have been turned over.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) MITCHELL:John should have, should have demanded them.You should have demanded all of them.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) what the hell was he doingas counsel to the President without getting them? He was--I told him to conduct an investigation, and he did.MITCHELL:I know.PRESIDENT:Well, it's like everything else. MITCHELL:Anything else for us to--PRESIDENT:Get on that other thing. If Baker can--Bakeris not proving much of a reed up to this point. He's smart enough.MITCHELL:Howard is smart enough, but, uh; we've gotto carry him. Uh, I think he has and I'vebeen puzzling over a way to have a liaison with him and, and, uh--PRESIDENT:He won't talk on the phone with anybodyaccording to Kleindienst. He thinks his phone is tapped.MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:5' TO 3:43 P.M.70MITCHELL:He does?PRESIDENT:Who's tapping his phone? MITCHELL:I don't know.PRESIDENT:Who would he think, who would he think wouldtap his phone? I guess maybe that we would.MITCHELL:I don't doubt that.PRESIDENT:He must think that Ervin--MITCHELL:Maybe. PRESIDENT:Or, or a newspaper. MITCHELL:Newspaper, or, or the Democratic Party, orsomebody. There's got to be somebody toliaison with Kliendienst to get in a position where--It's all right fromforeknowledge through Kliendienst.PRESIDENT:You really wonder if you take Wally Johnsonand uh--He's a pretty good boy, isn't he?MITCHELL:Yeah. (Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:You might, you might throw that out to Dean.Dean says he doesn't want to be in such a, such a public position. He talked to the Attorney General (unintelligible) WallyJohnson. And he said that--MITCHELL:Well, he will be in the Department,&#8211; PRESIDENT:Yeah.MITCHELL:&#8211;talking to the Department.PRESIDENT:(Unintelligible) Mansfield's down there-- MITCHELL:Everything else under control? PRESIDENT:Yeah, we're all going fine. I think, though,that as long as, uh, everyone and so forthis ah, uh--(unintelligible) still (unintelligible)MARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M.71MITCHELL:All of Washington--the public interest inthis thing, you know.PRESIDENT:Isn't (unintelligible)worries the shit outof us here in regard, regarding(unintelligible)MITCHELL:Just in time.PRESIDENT:But the point is that, uh, I don't--There'sno need for him to testify. I have nothing but intuition, but hell, I don't know. I, but--Again you really have to protect thePresidency, too. That's the point.MITCHELL:Well this does no violence to the Presidencyat all, this concept--PRESIDENT:The whole scenario.MITCHELL:Yeah. PRESIDENT:No, it, uh, uh, a-, that's what I mean. Thepurpose of this scenario is to clean thePresidency. (Unintelligible) what they say"All right. Here's the report, we're going to cooperate with the Committee.&#64258; and so forth and so on. The main thing is to answer(unintelligible) and that should be a Goddamned satisfactory answer, John.MITCHELL:It should be.PRESIDENT:Shouldn't it.MITCHELL:It answers all of their complaints they'vehad to date.PRESIDENT:That's right. They get cross-examination.MITCHELL:Right. They get everything but the publicspectacle.PRESIDENT:Public spectacle. And the reason we don'thave that is because you have to argueMARCH 22, 1973 FROM 1:57 TO 3:43 P.M.72MITCHELL:They have to argue and---PRESIDENT:&#8211;on a legal matter and you don't want themto be uh, used as a, uh, uh, for unfairly,to, to have somebody charged.********** MITCHELL:It's our fault that you have somebodycharged with not answering the Committee'squestions (unintelligible) to John, make sure you put it in, make sure that you put it again in the argument, the clean record,and that's the reason why you have anexecutive session. Because the record that comes out of it is clean. But, uh, in areasof dispute--PRESIDENT:I'd rather think, though, that all of theiryakking about this, uh, we often said, John- - we've got problems.MITCHELL:(Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:Might cost them (unintelligible). Think oftheir problems. They, those bastards are really--they're just really something.
