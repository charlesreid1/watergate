PRESIDENT:It's good that Dean asked him to, uh, HAIG:Oh God!PRESIDENT:get his own file out of there, because thefact that [unintelligible]. See that's, see that's the thing I was really concernedabout.HAIG:Well, we all were, and that's, that's PRESIDENT:Yeah. HAIG:a godsend.PRESIDENT:Let me just get the, go over this so youcan, uh, you know, reassure you a little on it. [Unintelligible] you know. I, I thinkabout it. This is the meeting of thetwenty-eighth, an hour an ten meeting, an hour and ten minute meeting. It'll also tell you why I, uh, I don't want othersdoing it, and why we cannot, uh, why, uh,uh, you know, you -I'm feeling [unintelligible] this report. Why we I re -without regard to Watergate, according to[unintelligible] just, uh, hang fire[unintelligible]. But, first, -uh, it was about, uh, it started with executive-8privilege. We discussed, uh, uh -Dean says,"You're not withholding any information on there, you know, on that, that line, line. We had a press conference and I got you ahistory for every bit of information thatwe're going to cooparate with.&#64258; And then, Dean had an idea to run Stans up first topursue as a stalking horse, as he put it.Uh, he said he can sandbag them, that's the word, then went on to say he thought that the public was bored on the, the Watergateback there. He said Stans is a victim ofcircumstance. He said, uh, he went on to say, "The White House is not involved."HAIG:Great.PRESIDENT:This is, this is a [unintelligible]. QuoteDean, "The White House is not involved.&#64258; I've got that, and I'm writing to them. Hetalked about Colson. Colson expected alawsuit, but, you know, he said that, "Well, that has a sobering effect," because it would show their position [unintelligible].Uh, it's, uh -talked to him about Colson.[Unintelligible] but that was all right. Then the question as to how to deal withBaker, uh, because you see I just, uh, andI, and I don't know. The question was whether Timmons could do it. And, uh, and I told him that Dean would be available totalk to him, that he'd be number-9one, so let's [unintelligible] everythingcentered in one person. Well, we talked about Gray. Uh, he said, that, uh, Dean was talking about, uh, he said, Nell, he'scomfortable with his testimony," and soforth, that kind of thing. And 1 said, "Well, I would be very close to[unintelligible].&#64258; And I told him that Ihad never seen Gray socially. That I know Hoover much better, and I've not been, uh -President Johnson whose been, uh, more Uh,then we let went back to Colson. I wouldhave vulnerability for, uh, regarding another area. You and Dean and I -I[unintelligible] who he's talking aboutColson's various things, but not [unintelligible] that case. He says he could win the suit but lose the war. Thisis Dean talking. But he said on the otherhand, uh, it'd be a good idea. And then the question of all the lawsuits [unintelligible]. Fourteen million dollarsworth were brought [unintelligible] on ourside; seventeen on their side. I said, "Well, all those suits should be settled.We should drop, uh, uh" -He said, "I agreetotally.&#64258; So that was that. Then he wondered how the Democrats could borrow money and so forth, and not report it. Sohe said, "McGovern's files were in terribleshape.&#64258; I said, "Well let's get that brought out in the hearing.&#64258; Uh, aad thenhe said, "Well, maybe the media can bring itout. Maybe that's-10something that Colson -Uh, told him to goover and make sure you get a word with Kleindienst, uh, because Kleindienst was also talking to the Committee about whetherwe should interrupt the questioning and onwhether we should have interrogatories. And Dean said, "The President isn't going tohide any information.&#64258; He said, "That'sthe, that's the line that we should -That's the truth [unintelligible] should say. [sigh] He said, "The hearings are tough,"and so forth and so on. Uh, "Everyone canstill pull, pull their same oar.&#64258; "Frankly," said he, "they've pulled them.&#64258;And I said, it was [unintelligible] he said,&#64257;[Unintelligible] pardon, look, they're going to be that [unintelligible] they're going to be [unintelligible].&#64258; Uh, then hewent -then he said, "Ervin's a puppet forKennedy.&#64258;HAIG:He said that? PRESIDENT:"The fine hand of Kennedy is in this wholething. Kennedy's men were on the floorduring the debate, uh. Uh, Dash is a Kennedy man -which we're trying to documentthat. That story should [unintelligible]sometime.&#64258; This is Dean talking. Then I said, "Johnson believed Bobby bugged him." I did. He said, uh, "Abe Fortas was the guywho was in charge of that sort of thing. Hewas a big Kennedy man."-11He told me a [unintelligible] story where adoctor in the FBI, [unintelligible] to the FBI, set it up so that a doctor would examine Jenkins and say that he was havingbrain problems. A brain tumor. The FBIrefused to approve the story.HAIG:No, I hadn't heard the story.PRESIDENT:Well, Hoover wouldn't play it. I missed apoint. [snaps fingers] Then we got into the '68 bugging. We didn't have any bugging, you know. Uh, and then he went into thisvery interesting thing with regard to thisthing: Hoover told Pat Coyne, Pat Coyne told Nelson Rockefeller, and Nelson Rockefellertold Kissinger that newsmen were bugged, uh,whether by us, or by, uh, others, I don't know, uh, or [unintelligible] -but anyway that's the, that, that thing came out. But,it gives you an idea of the kind of thing wewere talking about.HAIG: Yes sir. It does. PRESIDENT: And, uh, uh, the grapevine of the Bureau isthat, uh, they did it. Records, however,show no evidence. [Unintelligible] should be fired.HAIG: Should be fired.-12PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] and I told him that Hoovertold me, told Mitchell that I had been bugged [unintelligible]. [Unintelligible] it's in a memorandum, where the Agnew planeout of Chicago had been bugged. DeLoach wasthen going to go through Mitchell [unintelligible]. Time magazine, uh,RESTRICTED-&#64257;B&#64258;HAIG:No.PRESIDENT:No. Then, we talked about getting out the'68 story. Getting out the President'sstory. Uh, Goldwater had been [unintelligible] Goldwater [unintelligible]. Then, for the first time, we got intoWatergate, at that point. He said that the,that uh, uh, that they were using probation officers [unintelligible]. Dean[unintelligible] in a very-13flagrant way said [unintelligible]. Andthen I said, "Thirty five year sentence -then went into something, no weapons, and no injuries and so forth. And this is justa very flagrant thing.&#64258; Uh, I said, uh, Isaid, "For example, if a black held up a store with a gun, uh, he'd get perhaps twoyears.&#64258; And Dean kind of -"Yeah, he'd gettwo years, and he'd get a suspended sentence."HAIG:That's a [unintelligible].PRESIDENT:And then, he said, then he told me thesefellows can't even get out on bail. He said the point would come that--Then we got intothe Court. About, what [unintelligible].And I said, &#64257;When is that son-of-a-bitch Baz-Bazelon going to get out of there?&#64258; [Unintelligible]. Uh, see we tried to get abill to get Bazelon out, so that we can, AAnd he said, "Well, I think he's going to wait us out " And I said, "dell, we've got to get, uh, a list, uh, a kind of a list ofthe best people in the country for judges:Circuit Court, District Court, and Supreme Court. We've got to do that in a hurry."HAIG:Did he agree?PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] On to the Supreme Court.And here's the kind of thing that you would not want [unintelligible] uh,-14the press [unintelligible] out. We talkedabout a black, Mar-he pointed out that Marshall was in bad health. I said, "Well, I didn't, I didn't know whether that wasconfirmed or not.&#64258; And I said, "In myview," I said, of there's a, there's a good fellow, uh, a black, who's that fellow,Brown, who's the head of the Equal EconomicOpportunity," but I said, "maybe Jewels Lafontaine is the best.&#64258; I said, "There you kill two birds with one stone. You've got ablack and a woman.&#64258; And he said,"Brilliant-- she's great. She'd be fine."RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;Right. [Unintelligible] butthat's the kind of talk we had.HAIG:Uh, yeah. But [unintelligible] you can't,you can't make it public.PRESIDENT:Well, we can't -but he might.HAIG:[Unintelligible]-15-PRESIDENT:But I, is that going to be bad? What thehell difference does that make? That is irrelevant to this whole investigation. And, uh, I said, "The people in the Senatecan't possibly vote against Jewel.&#64258; Hesays, "Absolutely."[Unintelligible/REMOVED] I told him to talkto Kleindienst about this whole problem[unintelligible].&#64258; He sympathized. I said, "How would you like Teddy Kennedy to propose the judges?&#64258; [Unintelligible] I said, "Iwant you to know that appointmentsare notgoing to go on the basis of -they, they're saying that you need a Jewish seat." And Isaid, "Now look, there's no Jewish seat onthat Court." I said, "There are Jews all around this White House.&#64258; I said, "You've got Arthur Burns; you've got HenryKissinger; you've got [unintelligible].&#64258;And I said, "What we have to do, we&#8482;ve got to ri- realize we've got to appoint some [unintelligible]. They may not be quite upto what we think is the standard, but we'vegot to get them and pull them up.&#64258; I said, "That's the way our system works."Uh, uh, Isaid, "Republicans are worse than theDemocrats in this respect, because they're snobbish. And here's Nixon telling him, 'We've got to spread the base. And, uh[unintelligible].HAIG:(Unintelligible] absolutely, uh[unintelligible].-16PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]HAIG:[Unintelligible] but there isn't anydifference.PRESIDENT:No, but I mean, I'm trying to point out now,that in this [unintelligible] you, you'llknow the damn truth [unintelligible] reference to Watergate [unintelligible].That maybe something that's a plus. But Goddamn it, my recollection is correct. Now we go into Sullivan. He said he watched him work with Huston. "He's a good man,reliable, et cetera.&#64258; He said Felt wasknown as the "White Rat" at the, at the, uh, FBI. And, uh, the question, uh, I think heraised, is he, uh, is he Jewish. And, uh,Dean said, "He, he could be.&#64258;RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;I said, "We have that here at the WhiteHouse."So he says, "Huh?"HAIG:[chuckles] Exactly right. PRESIDENT:And Dean says, "Well, there will never be aleak from me, &#8218;cause I don't know how toleak. I couldn't possibly leak." Thequestion that we got people in jail. I said, "I feel for these guys in jail,particularly for Hunt; his wife has beenkilled, and so forth. Dean said, "Well, they're all hanging in tough.&#64258; I said, "What are they doing, looking for clemency?&#64258;He said, "Yes.&#64258; And I said,-17"We couldn't do it.&#64258; [unintelligible] said,"Well, maybe it will get so absurd, so political, and so forth, that we could do something later on&#64258;, and it was dropped.That was the only talk about clemency, andmy remark was: &#64257;[Unintelligible] clemency, and let&#8482;s keep it clean.&#64258; Then, we got intothis disruption of, by the Democrats. Andhe pointed out that McGovern had, uh, Dick Tuck on his payroll. He tried to do a couple of [unintelligible] didn&#8482;t come off.And then I said, &#64257;What the hell did Segrettido?&#64258; And Dean says, "He did some funny things, but nothing really serious.&#64258; And hesaid, "We could keep--,&#64257; and he said &#64257;Chapinis not involved, except tangentially." He said, "They're going after Herb Kalmbach with a vengeance." Uh, &#64257;But&#64258;, he said,"Herb is a strong man who makes, has alogical explanation for everything." And I said, &#64257;Look, they are going to bring in his, uh, representation of the President at SanClemente, my private [unintelligible].Nobody's asking for that.&#64258; Uh, but the important thing to note here, is not aboutKalmbach afterward, but before. You see,Kalmbach raised money before, because, I have said, but the thing that concerns me is that, the fact that, uh, I read this in some[unintelligible] the money was sent througha bank in Mexico, or through Mexico. [Unintelligible] Watergate thing. And.Deansaid, "That can all be-18-explained.&#64258; But he didn't mention the factthat [unintelligible], and so forth, up to this point, that afterwards Kalmbach raised money, which is the point that I&#352;-he evenindicated [unintelligible], to put that ina box.HAIG:Yes sir.PRESIDENT:It&#8482;s not--uh I said, &#64257;Get Baker, uh, whatwe ought to do is get Baker and the others to come out to run this hearing like a court. No hearsay.&#64258; He said, &#64257;Excellentidea. Make it a model of [unintelligible]&#64258;[Unintelligible] and Dean said, talking about the past, he says, &#64257;Well, I, it's',it's been a long way, but I&#8482;m convinced that[unintelligible] but I'm convinced we're going to make it.&#64258; That could be an implication that we, that, just, ju--no[unintelligible] he didn't even suggestcover-up. Uh, we talked about the hearings, and I, and they are just--and I said, I said, "John, you [unintelligible] that thePresident has told the truth.&#64258; And Deanemphatically said, "I know, I know.&#64258; I said, "When I heard about this, I thoughtthey were all crazy. I thought they werenuts." He said, "I know." Then he said at one point, "You know they don't -they'll be after Colson and Ehrlichman, Haldeman andEhrlichman. They might even be after Dean.&#64258;This is, at that point, I said, "No, they can't be after you--why?&#64258; That was all.-19-On the first, the next day, the question waswhether Kleindienst would [unintelligible] Baker [unintelligible]. Uh, Gray, Dean said, had given a story in his testimonythat he wanted so terribly to be confirmed.And when he said records would be available to any Senator--FBI records. Then I wentinto the business about the Hiss case, howthey wouldn&#8482;t even let us have anything, let alone records&#352;-raw files is what he meant. Then Dean emphatically says, &#64257;I never gavethe FBI records to Segretti. I never showedhim an FBI record.&#64258; And I said, "Yes, John,&#64258; I said, &#64257;You were conducting aninvestigation for the White House.&#64258; Hesaid, &#64257;That&#8482;s right. And I was entitled to sit in those investigations.&#64258; [Unintelligible] talked about Gray, and Isaid, &#64257;It looks to me like he's going to bedone. He&#8482;s trying to pamper the Senators.&#64258; "That's right,&#64258; Dean says, "he's bull-headed.&#64258; Then I said to-uh "We've gotto,RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;just to show you the kind of colorfullanguage, [unintelligible] that we, abouthow this FBI thing --Hell, it's the worst [unintelligible]. "The FBI cannot turn raw files over to the Senate or anywhere.'else!&#64258; Then I asked him for a memorandum.with regard to uh, how the Democrats had used the FBI. One little thing, the DanSchorr [unintelligible]. And I said, we allknow-20-about that.&#64258; I said, "Let's understand&#352;-&#64257; Uh, but there was no bugging involved, That was simply, uh, a uh, study had been made [unintelligible]. Uh, but as you know, thatwas one where [unintelligible]. Dan Schorr,we never intended to hire him, and he knew it, and everybody else knew it. Whathappened was we just asked for a namecheck on the son-of-a-bitch, due to the fact that he was [unintelligible]. It was a national security matter. But, uh, that san old story, and, uh, it isn&#8482;t much really.We have been so kind, and so good, as using the FBI concern is concerned, compared withprevious administrations. We then talkedabout DeLoach. DeLoach had had lunch after seeing Kleindienst. And he said, Klein-- DeLoach said, "There, there had been nobugging under President Kennedy they say&#64258;,and I told Gray, and then I told Dean that I had told Gray when he came in, uh, when I said the same thing about the[unintelligible] and I urged him to give allthe FBI people lie detector tests. And then, uh, Dean said, "Yes, but that shouldbe after the hearings.&#64258; And I said, "Iagree. But the God damned place has got to be cleaned out. You got to have this be believed [unintelligible]. And I also tellDeLoach that we have other evidence.&#64258;[Unintelligible] And I also came to him to tell Kendall that, so that DeLoach would beput-21-on notice that we have had some informationon that [unintelligible]. I never trusted DeLoach, myself, because, he&#8482;s a politician[unintelligible/REMOVED] I pointed out[unintelligible] the difficulty with all[unintelligible] FBI [unintelligible] the Bureau can't survive [unintelligible] cameback with us, uh, then, about sitting in onthe investigation [unintelligible]. Then Gray bitched about his sitting in on the investigation. Said, "John, nobody ever satin on an FBI investigation before.&#64258; Deaninsisted because he was conducting an investigation for the President.[Unintelligible] No question about it.Commented on Gray, and I said, &#64257;The trouble with Gray, he has outward self-confidence but not inward self-confidence." And I gavean analogy [unintelligible].&#64258; Dean said,"Well, then Gray will be O.K.&#64258; I said, &#64257;Well, what we have to do is to clean out the FBI like Schlesinger was doing with theCIA. We've got to get the dead wood out,"or words to that--Then we talked about Gray's investigation of Watergate. Uh,that, uh, that he was proud of hisinvestigation, and Dean said, "Though he caused us some grief.&#64258; What he meant by that I don't know. Then I recounted to himthat I had talked to Gray once.[unintelligible] "Yes, I, I've heard about that.&#64258; Uh, he said, "The difficulty withGray is that he was around the countrymaking speeches rather than sitting on top of the investigation." A little finger comes in there. What Dean was-22-trying to do was to get Gray &#352;- not -- Getmy point?HAIG:Yeah. PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] and I gave him a copy of mybook Six Crises to read the chapter on Hiss.[Handles paper] That&#8482;s two days of it.HAIG:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:All day tomorrow. You never know whenanother of these conversations--But, you know, I ordered it! Christ, you know, you pick up the paper and it says: &#64257;Dean saysthat the President&#64258;-- This, now these are,but this, this, this is an hour, almost, an hour and forty-five minutes of conversation,Al.HAIG:And they're the ones that really thinkthere's been anything. They wanted their man.PRESIDENT:I don't know. You mean at the beginning?[Unintelligible]HAIG:[Unintelligible] I got to tell Steve to getthe telephone.

I would see him at work, see him come-- know how hehandled the [unintelligible] and so forth.You know, that's what I thought.PRESIDENT:Now, with regard to our meetings that wehave here, uh, just to give you a quickrun-down: [sighs] Up until about the s-, the s--, seventeenth, [unintelligible] seventeen, [unintelligible] there was nodiscussion whatever of basic conceptions ofWatergate.ZIEGLER:[unintelligible] March? PRESIDENT:Yes. Then there started the discussion ofsubstance. Then, it wasn't until thetwenty-first, however, that I turned my [unintelligible] 'cause that's when he camein with the cancer in the heart of thepresidency-61-thing. That didn't [unintelligible]. So,you'd be interested to know that-- uh, unfortunately I do not have the telephone logs for calls I made, I made-- I called hima couple of times from Camp David, and Icalled him a couple of times from Key Biscayne, in addition to the time I was withyou. We don't have any recordings of those.So--ZIEGLER:But I recall pretty clearly what you said. PRESIDENT:No. No, you remember that one, but I calledhim a couple of other times.ZIEGLER:Yes. PRESIDENT:The twenty-third. So he may have somethingthere. I don't think he's be[unintelligible] do you?ZIEGLER:No. PRESIDENT:But if he did, he did.ZIEGLER:But that was, that was,PRESIDENT:In the [unintelligible) period. ZIEGLER:it was after the twenty-first. PRESIDENT:Twenty-third, yeah. Well, no, it wasn'tearlier. [unintelligible]-62BULL:[Unintelligible] time was incorrect[unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Time was incorrect? BULL:Yes sir.PRESIDENT:But, I'm through with thatBULL:You're though with that. Would you like totake break for a while sir?PRESIDENT:Yes. I'm going to take it right now. Now,get me, though, the next one.BULL:You want the next one set up? Sir? PRESIDENT:Where are you now?BULL:You're up to the seventeenth. You justfinished the seventeenth.[Unintelligible/REMOVED]PRESIDENT:If you could get these calls--BULL ANDPRESIDENT:[Unintelligible/REMOVED]PRESIDENT:Well, like I say, I don't need thetwenty-first, 'cause Haldeman&#8482;s got thenotes on that one. Why don't you give me-- let's try this one. Right here. It'll be--BULL:March thirteenth [unintelligible]-63-PRESIDENT:This unfortunately doesn&#8482;t say whether it'sthe EOB or the OVal, Oval-- it doesn't say [unintelligible] Have those two ready. [unintelligible][Bull leaves]Yeah. Like everything else, it's not aperfect case a pretty good one[unintelligible]ZIEGLER:Yes. PRESIDENT:The total nonsense that at forty-onemeetings we talked about cover-up in fact[unintelligible], you know, about, uh,Watergate. On the twenty-seventh, the first time we met-- you don't need to make notes--Well, I, I wrote twenty-eighth, because Idid that one first. Was about Executive Privilege. And we went on and on and on. Uh, his idea of sending Stans out as astalking horse, you know, and, uh, and, uh,who is to, uh, uh-- how to deal with Baker. Dean-- he will be able to talk about that. Uh, uh, I didn't know Gray well, socially.All that crap. Uh, Colson [unintelligible]about bringing a lawsuit. He had vulnerability [unintelligible] in otherways. [unintelligible] That whole suitshould be dropped. I said it would be fine if they would. That was all, you know what I mean, for Christ sakes. [Unintelligible]uh, "The President's not-64-going to hide any Information," says Dean.[unintelligible] and incidentally, they're going to be, If they're going to get partisan then he'd rather than they bepartisan. Uh, Ervin is a puppet forKennedy. Kennedy is, uh, oh-- a lot of that. [unintelligible] Johnson belived thatBobby bugged him. Abe Fortas knew it, andso forth and so on. [unintelligible] The '68 bugging. Hoover was [unintelligible] and so forth and so on [unintelligible] Timemagazine article at that time.RESTRICTED-&#64257;B&#64258;Then we had-- I don't why thehell we had It a long discussion about judges. And this shows you why we cannothave Presidential [unintelligible] No effecton this case, but it would be very embarrassing If it were out. We couldn'tdeny it. Uh, well, first, we talked aboutthe fact this is a thirty-five year sentence. There's no weapons, there's no-- jees, it's ridiculous. Blacks who've heldup a store with a gun could have got offwith a suspended sentence or something like that. Guys can't get out on bail.Everybody but Bazelon-- why can't we get himto retire, and all that sort of thing. The Supreme Court. He said Marshall has a bad-65-heart. &#64257;Hell," I said, "well there's acouple of black woman that I-- Brown," and I said, "Jewels". I said, "Why not, why not two birds with one stone: a black woman.&#64258;We talked about that, and, uh, thenRESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;But that's the kind of thing-- and I said,"You know, those bastards in the Senatecouldn't vote against Jewels.&#64258; That's thekind of talk that goes on.ZIEGLER:Of course it does! God God! PRESIDENT:IF that kind of thing comes out, it's allright with me. If it does just-- well, wejust say: [unintelligible], you know what I mean.ZIEGLER:Yeah. I mean what could, well--PRESIDENT:I could put out the fact that Haldeman[unintelligible] Senators bastards and said that Brennan was a boob.-66-ZIEGLER:That-- Mr. President! That doesn't-- Idon't--PRESIDENT:I may, may just tell them. And I talkedabout Jews.ZIEGLER:of course.PRESIDENT:I said we're not going to-- there's noJewish seat. I said, &#64257;I&#8482;ve got them allaround me.&#64258; I said, &#64257;I&#8482;ve got Kissinger andI've got Stein, and [unintelligible]." But I said, "It's time to get a few ethnics on the Court. You've got to take some peopleand bring them up.&#64258; I said, "The Democratsare much better than we are. The Republicans are snobs." I said, &#64257;We've gotto spread the base [unintelligible] So, wetalked about [unintelligible] Sullivan [unintelligible]. Called Felt the "White Rat.&#64258; Known as the "White Rat.&#64258; Uh, thequestion was whether he's Jewish. Uh, andI, said, and I pointed out ourRESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;But Dean says, "They'll neverbe a leak out of me. I just don't know howto leak."ZIEGLER:[Laughs]PRESIDENT:Then I said, "I feel for those guys in jail,particularly Hunt.&#64258; And Dean says, "They're hanging in tough. They're--&#64258;. Now, that rings a bell. [unintelligible]. And I-67-said, "Are they looking for clemency?&#64258; Hesaid "Yes". And I said, "We couldn't do it." He said, "Well, you know, it may get so absurd., politically, and so forth, that weshould watch it close [unintelligible]"ZIEGLER:[unintelligible] PRESIDENT:The point is, that, that the discussion wasonly, uh-- not in terms of, uh, of uh,anything serious.ZIEGLER:Of course not! PRESIDENT:I said, I said, "Are, are they looking forclemency?" I asked the question. And hesaid "Yes.&#64258; And I said, "We couldn't do it."ZIEGLER:And he said "Hanging in tough," but he saidthat in the framework of what his knowledge was. Not in the framework of what your knowledge was.PRESIDENT:Hell no. I, I didn't know what the hell--hanging in tough by not saying anybody else was involved, and so forth, but I didn't, I wasn't telling him that.ZIEGLER:Sure.PRESIDENT:Not at this point. Uh, we talked about thedisruption of my campaign. What didSegretti do. We've got to-68-keep Segretti in perspective. Chapin really[unintelligible] bad rap. They're going to go after Kalmbach because the money came from [unintelligible]. Dean says there'llbe a logical explanation for[unintelligible] Uh, Kalmbach is tough. Uh, uh, uh, it can all be explained. The moneyto a bank in Mexico [unintelligible] he saysthat can all be explained. Uh, I say, "Get the hearings on [unintelligible].&#64258; Uh, I said, "It's a battle we can, uh, uh -" Wethought that-- Then Dean said&#352;this should'verung a bell&#352;- I-- it's been a long road. I thought it was a long road. And it's along road ahead but I can-- and then Ithought, in perspective-- what the hell he was talking about.ZIEGLER:Sure.PRESIDENT:I said, I said to him, I said, "John, theimportant thing is the President has told the truth.&#64258; And he said, "I know.&#64258; And I said, "You know, when I heard about it, Ithought they were crazy. I thought theywere nuts." Dean says, uh-- Oh, then the point is that he could-- could he raise themoney. Could we [unintelligible] Dean[unintelligible]ZIEGLER:That's right. And this is just before the,uh, Gray&#352;--69-this was the Gray test--PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] as well as Colson, Haldemanand Ehrlic--, Ehrlichman.ZIEGLER:The Ervin hearings and the--PRESIDENT:Gray hearings, right. [Handles paper] Yeah.[Unintelligible] the first of March. Uh, question again: has Kleindienst seen Ervinand Baker yet? Gray gave the store away,you know, records [unintelligible] that kind of thing. Uh, then I told him about the Hiss case. And how we did this and that.[unintelligible] book and told him to readit. Uh, and Dean said, Dean said that, "I did not give the FBI records to Sirica.It's a damn lie.&#64258; And, uh, I said, Nixon,uh RN, the White House is simply conducting its own investigation. Right? He said "Yes.&#64258; [unintelligible] Ziegler isconducting the White House investigation andsuggested this lie go through. Matter of fact, he wanted to take what I didn't do, uh-- See, where [unintelligible] couple ofthem. And, uh, variation on the tapeinvolved, uh, [unintelligible] Dean, or, or the fact that nobody at the White House wasinvolved.ZIEGLER:Okay.-71-PRESIDENT:Then we had some, I had some[unintelligible]. He said that, he said that-- I, I referred to Gray as being dumb, dumb, pampering to the Senators. Dean said,"He&#8482;s bullheaded.&#64258; Uh, and I said,"[unintelligible] the a FBI is'going to anybody who's terrible.&#64258; And I said,RESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;ZIEGLER:It's great stuff! [Laughs] Can you imaginethat, though, beingPRESIDENT:-- being spread in the public record? Thisis why, you've to got to keep this [unintelligible] but this cannot you can't give the President's papers out, can you?ZIEGLER:No, you can't, but--PRESIDENT:Of course he didn't make a record of this. ZIEGLER:No, no. That&#8482;s not-- PRESIDENT:Well, let's go on. Nixon asked Dean-- Oh,yeah, yeah, I told him that I can't confusethe FBI and the CIA. This was, this is on [unintelligible]. Damn sure of that. Isaid, uh, "That's a tough one." I said, uh,but I said, "They're [unintelligible] bugging him.&#64258; I said, "You were just trying to get information on him. I said,-71-there wasn't really [unintelligible] on theGod damn staff. I said it was done at a lower level [unintelligible] We've answered that Shore thing before.ZIEGLER:That's right.PRESIDENT:How we handled it-- We, we insisted that wewere considering him for a job.ZIEGLER:[Unintelligible] That's all right. That'smy view. That's what I was told.PRESIDENT:I said, "We have been so kind and so goodcompared to previous Administrations in ouruse of the FBI. And then this Kleindienstreport:bugging the President's plane. Now I told Gray to give them all liedetector tests, after the hearings. Uh, andDean said, "After the hearings [unintelligible] the FBI, because of the leaks." We tried to tell DeLoach that helied to the Attorney General[unintelligible] said that we had not bugged the plane. [unintelligible] I never trusted DeLoach. Politican to the degree.I believe he talked to the Post, uh, this is[unintelligible]. Dean: "They bitchedbecause I sit in on the investigation."Dean insisted-- came because he was-- andDean says, "I insisted because I was conducting an investigation for-72-the President.&#64258; Dean said [unintelligible]"Gray," I said, "had outward self-confidence but not inward." Dean says, "He'll be O-- you know [unintelligible].&#64258; And I said,"Well, we're going to clean out the FBI likeSchleshinger did the CIA [unintelligible] good enough too&#352;- Oh, he couldn&#8482;t. He said,"Gray is very proud of his investigation ofWatergate.&#64258; And then he said though he-- here&#8482;s another [unintelligible]-- though he caused us a lot of grief. And I just-- Hethen went on to say-- And I pointed out, Isaid, "I talked to Gray once. I, I was [unintelligible] I heard about that. Hesaid, "What?&#64258; I said, "What's the problemhere? He said, "Well, the trouble was he was travelling around the country making speeches rather than staying on top of theinvestigation. But you see, in thatrespect, what he was really [laughs] saying was that he had a [unintelligible] on Gray. [Unintelligible] I, I pointed out that theFBI did not, uh, [unintelligible]. And,also, the first, uh, uh we get on FBI files, uh, [unintelligible] Sandberg on amnesty,you know. Dean said "We could team on thisthing.&#64258; Now, February twenty-seventh. We go back to the first one. This is the first time I saw him very much. It was aboutKleindienst and Baker and Gray. About our[unintelligible] have its effect on Baker on getting a minority counsel. And he said,"Minority counsel-73-is [unintelligible]. Curious as to whyBaker mentioned it. However, this is not&#352; hard to avoid a circus and so forth. And then, I said, &#64257;You know, I showedKleindienst up with that.&#64258; Oh I quoted him.And, uh, [unintelligible] fact that, uh, whether or not, uh, Mitchell in this wholematter might be involved in purjury. Isaid, &#64257;That&#8482;s the question in this whole case. [Unintelligible] question [unintelligible]. You know, that was prettywell--ZIEGLER:Sure he would. PRESIDENT:around. And then he said, he, Dean had saidthat, &#64257;I told Kleindienst that I don't thinkI should brief you on all I know. If you get on the wrong track I will tell you.&#64258; And I said, "Good", about the whole thing.I don&#8482;t know what he meant, did I? I think that&#8482;s what he was simply, uh&#352;I, I gathered from that he had told Kleindienst that. He didn't tell me that. Anyway, but thereagain, now there's a little glimmer againthat Dean is not coming through. [Unintelligible] session Baker, White Housestaff, Mollenhoff, uh, etcetera, etcetera.The Hiss case, Brandon, uh, from the FBI,uh-- And we hadn&#8482;t bugged much compared to the others, uh-- they used the FBI to coveruh, uh-- and so forth. Why didn't Sullivan-- andy help [unintelligible]. Sullivan took all the records when he left. He didn'tprotect-74-the White -uh you've heard that storybefore, Ron. He gave them back to Mardian.ZIEGLER:Yeah PRESIDENT:All this comes out in here.[Unintelligible] Gray. Felt, uh, placed,uh, against Gray and against Green and against Sullivan back. Another interestingthing: He heard that Sandy Smith had toldPetersen about it all-- Felt. And then he just dropped it aside. Petersen, bless his soul, has b-en a valuable man to us. He wasproceeding from one assumption, Ron,ZIEGLER:And that was that you were aware-- PRESIDENT:and [unintelligible] with another. Well,that-- Yeah, that's right! And that, uh,and that there's been a hell of a damn lousy investigation. They really had watered the God damn thing. Now later on, you see whereJeb Magruder and-- the yeoman. He knowsabout the yeoman, about the yeoman. Can't blow the whistly on [unintelligible]. [Unintelligible] lied on a writteninterrogation and then he went here's whatDean said: "You, Mr. President, are not holding anything back.&#64258; [Sighs][unintelligible] said, Dean, &#64257;-- , uh--Before the election what I will do is just keep your [unintelligible], just as before the election. I only-75-bothered Haldeman and Ehrlichman on thethings that were absolutely essential. [Unintelligible] Huh?ZIEGLER:Yes sir.PRESIDENT:Now we go to March sixth. That carries u0sto March sixth. There you are, there's all of February up till [unintelligible]. Nowwhat the hell is there?ZIEGLER:Not a thing. PRESIDENT:About a coverup?, ZIEGLER:[Unintelligible] In his frame of mindPRESIDENT:Hell yes!ZIEGLER:and in the context of today you couldthere are some things there that--PRESIDENT:Oh, hell yes! Oh yeah. I would not backthen! March the sixth was a[unintelligible/REMOVED] I said, "Were weright to send Gray down?&#64258; He said, "Yes."He has a point there. I was not[unintelligible/REMOVED] out that, uh,Sullivan in one of his reports, uh, the dealon Chan-- or John Chancellor where he had afull-fleet investigation an Chancellor. Didyou hear about that?ZIEGLER:No.-76-PRESIDENT:LBJ had a [unintelligible].ZIEGLER:[Unintelligible] PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] Dean-- that's where I got[unintelligible].

Well, we want Dick Moore to give Ron Whatchamacallit orwhatever the hell his name is, you know,Dean-- [unintelligible]. EOB apparently doesn't pick up at all.BULL:It doesn't work quite, uh, very well at all,sir. Mr. President, you and Dean were onthe twenty-first you were in the-- you had a report on the, uh, [unintelligible]twenty-second.PRESIDENT:I don't have a report, but I-- they werethere.Yeah.

BULL:if you have any problems with that I can--[Bull leaves]PRESIDENT:Ervin/Baker:this is all [unintelligible]BULL:They're all just [unintelligible] PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] Then he says, "Must hum thesame tune or we create problems.&#64258; Not justremember, he was just talking-80-about the witnessesZIEGLER:Yeah. PRESIDENT:who were [unintelligible]. The seventh,talked about Gurney. I suggested questionsthat they could ask.ZIEGLER:They re all related to the Ervin Committeehearings.PRESIDENT:Gurney-- like the questions that they couldask, and so forth. [Unintelligible] Gray, and asked, [unintelligible]. This is all a question of how to get good questions out toGray with regard to how the FBI had beenused politically before, had never been used politically for us. Well, the last-- Oh, Icame around at the very conclusion, I said,&#64257;Well, there may be-- it may hurt the FBI but I'm sure&#352;you know, we, we just-- and nothing was done in the future. Segrettididn't, no he didn't turn over-- Dean didn'tturn over again. He kept coming back [unintelligible] Said &#64257;We are clean,&#64258; quote. "Uh, I know these guys. None isworth a God damn-- these investigators. Nowyou've been [unintelligible].&#64258;ZIEGLER:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] I should have put Wilson inthe job. Ahh! [Unintelligible] for Gray he's, he's very much with Gray.-81-[Unintelligible] had withdrawn from thecase--that's a good break. Cha-- Chapin never hired anyone [unintelligible] way out of hand [unintelligible]. Pat Gray eventhough he-- He reported then on the Grayhearings. Then there was something about making Colson a consultant-- put him in adrawer or something. He, for example, youcould give him a position, uh-- Executive Privilege for things now-- he has it previously, anyway, at any vote, so that was[uninielligible] done or not.PRESIDENTor ZIEGLER:[Unintelligible/REMOVED]PRESIDENT:I said, "Did Haldeman know about Segretti.&#64258;He said "No--&#64258; Well, he said, "One likely question for Haldeman about [unintelligible] Segretti. [unintelligible]. And I said,&#64257;Did he?&#64258; He said, &#64257;No.&#64258; [Unintelligible]Dean [unintelligible]ZIEGLER:This was on the, uh-- PRESIDENT:This is the thir-- thirteenth now, thethirteenth.ZIEGLER:Thirteenth, yeah. PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible) questioning. And then, aninteresting point and again, uh, thistriggers something-- this is the thirteenty. Why not have it all let-- all hang out approach," I said. He says, "Exactlybecause they won&#8482;t-82-believe the truth.&#64258; We do let it all hangout. And watch this shit. Back to Sullivan, who testified but he doesn't give in, in writing. If Huston had yourinstructions, you know, for doing thingsthat were&#352;Hoover failed on the national security areas-- then the whole thingcrumbled, crumbled.ZIEGLER:[Laughs] PRESIDENT:It just&#352;- we-- But that's all you-- He saidthat Hoover lost his guts. He must haveknown [unintelligible] Huh? Actually, I'mnot sure that he knew the paper hadn&#8482;t gone through. Huston was.out there[unintelligible] forget. Incidentally, howabout those others things [unintelligible]ZIEGLER:The, uh, FBI clips? PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] I have that morning?ZIEGLER:They expect, they expect the list Fridaymorning, or tonight. Al said [unintelligible] we have a program with Scott, which Al's got--PRESIDENT:Yeah. [Unintelligible] Just getting thenumbers. We have nothing else but numbers.ZIEGLER:That's right. And we have a scenario thatScott can bring it up at the leader&#8482;smeeting:-83-PRESIDENT:Yeah.ZIEGLER:This is what you can say, and&#352; PRESIDENT:Yeah. You asked me about it and I do haveit, yeah I mean, Sullivan knows everything[unintelligible/REMOVED] Gray hearings again[unintelligible]. This is all on thethirteenth. The Gray hearings, I don't--[unintelligible/REMOVED] playing our game.Focus is on us. We've got to get our storyout. He mentioned the NBC broadcast [unintelligible] Dean said, "Well, no" hesays, "if you have to send him up though,they ask why. [Unintelligible] course that was Mitchell's [unintelligible].[Unintelligible] about the Texas guy whogave the money back, Allen-- what kind of crap we talking about! But there, he said, "Well it wasn't yours for Watergate.&#64258; And Isaid, "Why'd he put in his letter?" Oh, Idon't know. He wanted the check in Miami, and the Margaret check, and all that sort of thing. [Unintelligible] he shouldn't havedone that [unintelligible] cash the check[unintelligible] Mexico. This is getting back to Watergate. Now on the thirteenth,we finally get the little memory of what thehell was going in this. Sloan is weak, scared. He said, "We are [unintelligible] him.&#64258; I guess we all knew that though,about Sloan.-84-ZIEGLER:Well, su-- Sloan, uh, resigned in August.PRESIDENT:Yeah. ZIEGLER:People pretty well much felt that, uh, hisconcern about Stans--PRESIDENT:Kalmbach was sensitive about same story[unintelligible]ZIEGLER:Oh, I see.PRESIDENT:And, uh, I pointed out I only see him once ayear when he brings in the tax brief. [Unintelligible] returns. [Unintelligible] said he'd be a good witness. Check hisstory fifty times. He will be ready.Mitchell will be ready. Stans will be ready. Dean talked-- thirteenth of March.ZIEGLER:About [unintelligible]?PRESIDENT:Huh? ZIEGLER:Have you [unintelligibile]? PRESIDENT:Yeah. Magruder said that [unintelligible].The people around here won't be with us.[Unintelligible] when will the judge sentence? [Unintelligible] judge is Incredible. There may be a mis-trial. AndI, I said, "Well I like that-85-he's a hanging judge, and I, I," I said, I"like hanging judges.&#64258; [Unintelligible] This, this is-- Oh, now we're on the thirteenth. I said, "Who the hell are theyafter here?&#64258; And, uh, I said, uh, &#64257;My guessis that it's Mitchell and Haldeman.&#64258; Understand what I'm saying.ZIEGLER:Sure.PRESIDENT:Mitchell and Haldeman. ZIEGLER:Right. PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] Haldeman has a[unintelligible]. Now, I said, "Chapin--&#64258;He said, uh, "They will not, because that&#8482;s circumstantial. Uh, I said, "Colsonknew Hunt." He said, "Chapin didn't knowabut Watergate.&#64258; [Unintelligible] Then he said, "Strachan knew about Watergate.&#64258; I mean, I was very, uh, I, uh-- "Are you sureabout that?&#64258; Then he said, "But he'stougher than [unintelligible]. [Unintelligible] problems with Strachan. I came back to it. I said, "what do youknow?&#64258; I gathered from what he said thathe'd had nothing to do with the planning or conception of it then-- I think he may havegotten some materials.ZIEGLER:Right. PRESIDENT:You understand?-86-ZIEGLER:Sure.PRESIDENT:But I didn't react to that as uh, any greatGod damned aston-- astonishment. You know what I mean? But when he said "tough asnails," I suppose he left the impressionthat maybe Strachan had lied about it. But he probably didn't. Strachan probably toldthe truth. Now, if he say the materials[unintelligible] but anyway, he nailed Strachan there. Colson knew Hunt. He thinks he had knowledge that something wasgoing on over there. Dean talking[unintelligible]. He doesn't think he has any subject knowledge. That's what Deantells me. He says [unintelligible]thirteenth.ZIEGLER:of March. PRESIDENT:Right. Dean tried to drag in the[unintelligible].ZIEGLER:[Unintelligible] PRESIDENT:Yeah. Then I came back to this. I said, Isaid, "John, is it too late for the hang-outroute?&#64258; "Exactly.&#64258; I said, "Ehrlichman andHaldeman are for it.&#64258; [Unintelligible]. And then Dean says, "The dangers in thehang-out-- there are dangers in thehangout," and he said, "I think I can convince Ehrlichman that there's dangers in it for him."ZIEGLER:You see, but [clears throat] here, Mr.President [coughs] what you were talking about, what you had in mind, was not, atleast in my impression,-87-PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]ZIEGLER:was not payments to people PRESIDENT:Huh? ZIEGLER:or awareness of payments to people. Whatyou had in mind was relayingPRESIDENT:The hang-out (unintelligible) ZIEGLER:the hangout in terms of Segretti, whateverPRESIDENT:Segretti, and, and the Watergate!ZIEGLER:Hm? PRESIDENT:Planned the God, God dman Watergate! ZIEGLER:That's right.-87A-PRESIDENT:There's no cover-up in this, uh to thispoint, period -not one talk of cover-up.ZIEGLER:That&#8482;s right. PRESIDENT:You know, not one bit. There's a little-- that the feeling of it through hereStrachan, and, uh, this, you know, they&#8482;re "hanging tough" and so forth. He comes backto this. He says, "No one of the WhiteHouse knew it was done, but some may have seen the re-, the proofs of it.&#64258; [Unintelligible] What the hell is that? Hedoesn't-- He's not sure. Now he came backto Sullivan. This business about the fact, he says, "This cop up there knows more aboutChappaquiddick than anyone in the countryand we should get it out. Know the cop?" Got back to Kalmbach, somehow. The, uh [unintelligible] perfectly legal[unintelligible] funds and so forth. We'regoing to get Sullivan in and talk to him, [unintelligible] you know, and so forth and so on [unintelligible] whether or not we hadused the FBI (unintelligible] for nationalsecurity purposes. Said, "Yeah. The only exception, of course, was thatson-of-a-bitch Schorr.&#64258; But there--actually it was national security though [unintelligible] [laughing] we didn't say that. Okay. We just ran a name check onthe son-of-a-bitch.-88-ZIEGLER:That's right.PRESIDENT:Har Nothing! Now, the on the sixteenth,began some thinking,ZIEGLER:On the fourteenth, what happened?PRESIDENT:Nothing there. Just the press conference.Well, that's where we met them, uh, you see Steve, he&#8482;s got somethingZIEGLER:Well I was, uhPRESIDENT:very interesting. PRESIDENT AND ZIEGLER: [Unintelligible][Bull enters]PRESIDENT:Steve, BULL:Yes sir.PRESIDENT:give Ron the one little quote out of thatlog thing crap that you had to listen to. This was all-- fourteenth was all press conference.ZIEGLER:That's right. That-- Well, I remember--PRESIDENT:You were in on part. It's, it's terrible,it's' because we lost the best part.-89-BULL:The question was posed how do we ans-, howdo we answer the question whether we [unintelligible]. Uh, the response was that the [unintelligible] investigation wasconducted and the report given to me.PRESIDENT:I was supposed to say that-- no pr, or,Ziegler was supposed to say that.BULL:No, the PresidentPRESIDENT:The President. Yeah. BULL:You were supposed to say that. And, uh noinformation was found, uh, that would bePRESIDENT:-- any way implicate anybody at the WhiteHouse. There it is. There it is.BULL:That was Dean's recommended response to thequestion.PRESIDENT:So, in that context --that's all the waythrough.ZIEGLER:Yeah.PRESIDENT:He said, "Our report--&#64258;ZIEGLER:That's all the way through the gardners tohim.PRESIDENT:I said be sure there's no cover-up withregard to the FBI and so forth, and so onGray or anything. Then we went into the no written Dean report. But, I said&#352;--90-But he said-- I said "Why don't you give mecopy of your findings?&#64258; And have Gray give it to the FBI. Talked about Baker-again. I said that if Baker gets on the wrong side ofthis issue it will destroy his chance to bea leader. [Pause] He had no contacts with the Ervin Committee that were worth a damn.[Unintelligible] Goldwater make a speech, Sullivan-was preparing [unintelligible] And I say, "Get the story out.&#64258; Then he suggested Ziegler could get a statementbased on Dean's investigation[unintelligible][Bull leaves]ZIEGLER:I remember when that came up. I said that Ithought sworn affidavits were a bad idea.PRESIDENT:Anyway, so much-- at least he tried. Somequestions you can't ans-- Then Dean-- somequestions you can't ans--, you can't answer.No question, you can't answer because it'll get people in trouble. 'Cause we're so close now, we can&#8482;t-- I wond-- He suggestedfighting day and [unintelligible] Then hesays, again, &#64257;[unintelligible] runs into a whole flock of new problems which haven'temerged yet. We need a good master plan.&#64258;And,-91-uh, I'd like to talk a bit more about it. Isaid, "Why, why don't you and Moore go to Camp David and get us a plan.&#64258; [unintelligible] I was thinking inZIEGLER:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Talked about Mitchell's bad advice onCarswell, Kleindienst, and so forth I saidthat. "Can the White House position covernow? Keep that front and center. [Unintelligible] Can't have Liddy in any relation to the White House[unintelligible]." And he said, well, if he[unintelligible/REMOVED]. But anyway,though [unintelligible] [sighs] Now we cometo the seventeenth. Kleindienst wanted toturn Baker off [unintelligible] FBI. According to Haldeman, Mitchell told Haldeman-- and he said possibly Dean. And Isaid "What?&#64258; Dean too. Because I was overthis like a blanket. And I said, "John, you didn't know about it?&#64258; He said, 'That's right, I have no knowledge. No priorknowledge." He says, "How would you not todrag you, not to drag you." He was telling me that there was a cover-up?-92-ZIEGLER:Not at all.PRESIDENT:Anyway, then he said -started talking aboutMagruder: "Jeb's good, though [unintelligible] drag everything with him.ZIEGLER:But I mean every day that Mitchell-- I heardhim say that,PRESIDENT:Yeah.ZIEGLER:I would have related it to Mitchell.PRESIDENT:I know. And he said that he&#8482;d seen Li--Liddy right after it happened. And he said, "No one is the White House except possiblyStrachan [unintelligible] knew about it.&#64258;He said, "Magruder had pushed him without mercy." Said he talked to Dean right afterit happened. Then I say, "Don't you thinkHaldeman pushed him?&#64258; And Dean-- I, I, said, "I don't recall him pushing him. Dean says, "I agree." And he said, "Strachan mayhave pushed him." He says, "He probably had[unintelligible]" Bull shit. But you see again, this is a-- they knew what-- who was pushing for him. And I said, "I don't knowwhy the hell they went in.&#64258; A milliondollars and [unintelligible]. Now here's one-- I don't know what the hell I wassaying here, but-- I.said, you-93-know, "The thing here is that Magruder,Magruder put the heat on. Sloan starts pissing on Haldeman.&#64258; He said, "That couldn't be, uh, [unintelligible].&#64258; I said,"We've got to cut that off. We can't havethat [unintelligible] I said [unintelligible]). But we just stoppedright there. There was no&#352;- I suppose hecould say there that I was telling him to cover-up. [unintelligible].ZIEGLER:I suppose he could say that in, the contextof that time, but still, there's nothing,PRESIDENT:I didn't know-- ZIEGLER:nothing, Mr. President,PRESIDENT:didn't know that Magruder, uh, was lying.He was-- or that Sloan was.ZIEGLER:You knew no perjury was committed. All ofthis relates more to political problemsbefore the Ervin Committee and charges thatcould be made --PRESIDENT:Yeah. This one here is that, I was goingto-- it relates to the fact: why can't weget a report out of this, no, and so forth.I said, "Well, looking to the future, here are the problems. We got this guy, thisguy, And this guy." And I said, "Magruder isthe, uh one guy-- and that's-94-going to bring it right up to home. That'llbring it right up to the, the White House, the President.&#64258; And I said, "We've got to cut that, that-- that ought to be cut out.ZIEGLER:But keep in mind, Mr. President, that youwere not at this point talking about the trial. What you're talking about is theErvin Committee hearings. Now, there is noillegality in having received information you see,PRESIDENT:YeahZIEGLER:from the wiretapping operation. My view,if, if-- in hearing this, would have been in the context of the Ervin Committee hearings.If someone would say, "Well Strachanreceived the material. I remember going through this exercise with Bob. I said, "Bob, did you ever receive the material?"He said, "No." Now--PRESIDENT:Then he went on to say-- and here's thepoint that I hope he covers writing our statement-- Remember I told you&#352;- Ellsberg--don't say that I learned it for the firsttime from Petersen.ZIEGLER:No. That's right.PRESIDENT:We didn't [unintelligible]. Here's when Ilearned it. I was [unintelligible] exactly right. He told me, on the-95-seventeenth. Seventeenth. He says,Ehrlichman's got a call. Now, I said, &#64257;What the hell does he want?&#64258; Says, well-- then he told me about this God damned picture andEllsberg, and so forth-- that was the firsttime I ever heard about it. [unintelligible] Now this-- incidentally,when I, uh, I was just thinking of this,that, uh, we, assure him that-- I wondered, frankly, if Ehrlichman might have told you earlier and was lying to protect me. Thathe didn't, I didn't know my God damnedthing. Ehrlichman never should of sold. So there it was. Dean told me the sixteenth ofMarch.ZIEGLER:Seventeenth. PRESIDENT:Huh? ZIEGLER:Seventeenth.PRESIDENT:Seventeenth of March. It has nothing to dowith Ervin. Then he mentioned Chappaquidick.ZIEGLER:[unintelligible]PRESIDENT:It's a hell of a [unintelligible]ZIEGLER:See, all of Bud's contacts with thediscussion of the break-in [unintelligible].Now even making reference to the Ellsbergtrial on the seventeenth of March---96-PRESIDENT:Well, it was mentioned that Ervin[unintelligible] was having a problem with regard to [unintelligible]. We weren't talking about the trial at all.ZIEGLER:Sure.PRESIDENT:And, they had [unintelligible). Youunderstand, now--ZIEGLER:But the Justice Department had an[unintelligible]. That's the problem.PRESIDENT:They didn't have a God damned[unintelligible]ZIEGLER:There is nothing in here said to you thatwould have lead you to any conclusion that you should have acted in any way, becauseDean had--PRESIDENT:The whole point-- there's another reason Ishouldn't have. Dean was-- I don't like her--ZIEGLER:That's right.PRESIDENT:He is in tough with the Justice Department.Now he sees Kleindienst every day. Christ, I was so [unintelligible] for anything thathe would be tem-- passing over to Justice--he would pass it!ZIEGLER:That's what I'm saying. See my point, yeah--97-PRESIDENT:If anybody ever asks why you don't passsomething over, you learn from Dean. Christ, how could they the time be that-- April the sixteenth. Dean had thatobligation! And I assumed he was in directcontact with them.ZIEGLER:And you were talking about politicalproblems. Now their legal problems--politicalPRESIDENT:problems as they related to the ErvinCommittee hearings and one could come out inthe course of those hearings, uh, in thequestion. The-- damn I know that's the case. And those notes were [unintelligible]I was probably worried about the other onestoo, [unintelligible]. At least I hear about Strachan [unintelligible] Haldeman involved in the God damn thing --ZIEGLER:Sure you were. That's why you asked thatquestion.PRESIDENT:That's why I said, "Cut it off at the pass.&#64258;But what I was thinking there, wasbasically, uh, not to get all these guyspissing on each other. But Dean could go out-- just probably with some justification,and said that he, uh-- could probably saythat he told the President about all this, and warned him about all this. Dean said, "Strachan--&#64258;-98-ZIEGLER:No question. There's no [unintelligible).PRESIDENT:Strachan? This has been a very confidentialsource, so youguess you've heard it.ZIEGLER:Right.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible/REMOVED] Ron, is this: thatGod damn it, we were all wrong here. Didn'twant Ehrlichman involved or Haldemaninvolved.ZIEGLER:Right. PRESIDENT:That's right. We were all about that. ZIEGLER:You didn't feel they were.PRESIDENT:But getting down, listening to this thing,the one through the seventeenth, it totally explodes Dean's proposition or whatever.You were discussingZIEGLER:[Unintelligible] in the cover-up. PRESIDENT:Yeah! Aspects of the cover-up.[unintelligible] From his standpoint it was.So let's hear him testifying on that. Whatdid he, Ron? Who the hell is going to answer Dean? [unintelligible] How do we handle that? Haldeman can handle him on thetwenty-first, which is the tough one, but hecan handle him-- I think. [unintelligible]-99-find out what the hell he was doing, and soforth. But, uh, what about this?ZIEGLER:These, I think, are already handled. PRESIDENT:[unintelligible] getting out a certain time.I don't follow them. Uh, Buzhardt said thatDean made a friendly gesture to him Saturday. Did you hear about that?ZIEGLER:No, I didn't hear about the friendlygesture. No.PRESIDENT:[unintelligible] he didn't want to be atraitor [unintelligible]. Buzhardt gave hima tape, and, uh, it's-- a lawyer now-isplaying it. Very, very tough [unintelligible] after what Dean[unintelligible]. The lawyer was here[unintelligible] the lawyer [unintelligible] God damn [unintelligible]. Dean is likely to tell the lawyer the story from hisvantage point.ZIEGLER:Of course. PRESIDENT:God damn it! Oh, it's unbelievable[unintelligible] I didn't [unintelligible].I expressed total amazement when hementioned Strachan. Yeah, and I didn't believe him. [unintelligible]ZIEGLER:[unintelligible] I asked Bob, as I was[unintelligible]-100-I said, "Bob, you never received any of thisstuff.&#64258; And he said, "No," he said, [unintelligible].PRESIDENT:I think Strachan did [unintelligible]Strachan approved the bugging.ZIEGLER:[unintelligible] PRESIDENT:And there's no talk about the three-fifty.ZIEGLER:Not at all. I don't think there's any talkabout the three-fifty until into AprilPRESIDENT:Ah, yes there was. March twenty-first. ZIEGLER:You sure?PRESIDENT:I'm sure. Dean told me, Dean[unintelligible] that was part of the whole God damned investigation. I, I thought hemay have told me a little before, that's whyI left that's a little loose. But up till the seventeenth, at least we had a little talk [unintelligible]. The point is, thatwe've got the whole God damn thing for themonth of March [unintelligible], Ron. For whatever it's worth. But you, you, you, can hear what kind of crap it is.ZIEGLER:That's right. [unintelligible] after theinvestigation,-101-after a full ten months of a thoroughinvestigation by the Justice Department and putting trust in people around you, that this would be handled while you were in theprocess of everything else that happened in1972. God damn it, in March, when this started coming to you, you can tell by yourreactions.PRESIDENT:Yeah. ZIEGLER:You were saying, "What in the hell is thisgoing on?" And--PRESIDENT:I should have reacted before thetwenty-first of March, actually Dean shouldn't have had to come in to me with the"cancer in the heart of the presidency.&#64258; Tohis credit he did.ZIEGLER:That's right. He did. PRESIDENT:Haldeman didn't tell me that; Ehrlichmandidn't tell me that.ZIEGLER:And actually when John Dean did that, on thetwenty-first--PRESIDENT:Yeah.ZIEGLER:Yeah.-102-PRESIDENT:Why do you say that? That he did?ZIEGLER:Well, I think if he wouldn't have, uh, itwould not have been [unintelligible], would have not have been the thing that you wouldhave moved, which you did, on the matterrelating to [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:[unintelligible] How you getting along withthose calls about through?BULL:Yes sir. I'm logging them [unintelligible]. PRESIDENT:If you get them down to an hour, I can getthem done tonight, maybe.BULL:All right, sir. Fine.PRESIDENT: Fine. BULL:By the way, I found that I just can't-- notable to reproduce them, so I, I'm writingthem down by numbers [unintelligible] it's faster. I'm just logging them on a sequential calendar.PRESIDENT:Can they do that?BULL:[Unintelligible]-103-PRESIDENT:Great. [Sighs] God [unintelligible].ZIEGLER:[Unintelligible] PRESIDENT:Well you know I wonder if frankly Ron, whenI first saw, uh, heard about the God damnstory, that Haldeman [unintelligible]Watergate. I mean, God, maybe we were trying to [unintelligible] cover-up.Watergate. I really did! I didn't knowwhat the hell [unintelligible] I honestly didn't know!ZIEGLER:I remember, when I looked at that log, and Isaw myself misleading on the fourteenth, Isaid, "what on earth is he talking about?&#64258; Then I immediately recalled that on thefifteenth there was a press conference, andthen I immediately recalled that that was the period when we were talking about Gray, and Dean was being asked to appear, and wewere preparing the President as to how he.would respond to Executive Privilege, and would his counsel go up, and television, before the Ervin Committee hearings, andanticipating those kinds of questions.PRESIDENT:What is your view, Ron, as to how we handledthe whole Dean problem and so forth and soon? I don't know, uh it's, uh, this wholedeal related to the press. John Dean [unintelligible].-104-ZIEGLER:I think we let, uh, let Dean run his stringa little bit at least that's what I'd do at this point,PRESIDENT:Yeah.ZIEGLER:and not, uh, be supposed that--PRESIDENT:We can't let it run to the point that ithurts us too much.ZIEGLER:No. No.PRESIDENT:[unintelligible] Well, you counteract-- you,you, you at least deny it, I suppose.ZIEGLER:Yes sir.PRESIDENT:We denied that anything before-- so,[unintelligible]ZIEGLER:Well, not many that were denied.PRESIDENT:No. No. I know that, but [unintelligible]ZIEGLER:Yes sir. And then, if it begins to hurt toomuch, I would think that we would bring Moore into a backgrounding session probablywith a member of the prosecuting --PRESIDENT:Can you do that? ZIEGLER:Moore? Not directly, maybe.[unintelligible]PRESIDENT:You see, he's a witness in the God damn casehimself. [unintelligible]-105-ZIEGLER:Well then maybe we can do it through a thirdparty. May be Buzhardt will do it or something. Begin to get a [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:The, the backgroundwhat? That there arethese thirty-five--ZIEGLER:--were really twenty meetings, thirteenphone callsPRESIDENT:--thirteen phone calls--ZIEGLER:and they related to Ervin Committee, PRESIDENT:Yeah. ZIEGLER:uh, Gray hearings--PRESIDENT:Axe!ZIEGLER:Right. PRESIDENT:All the way through this.ZIEGLER:Sure.PRESIDENT:Obviously [unintelligible] anybody elsearound here trying to get him to axe, in my opinion. Oh, [unintelligible] each of themhave other fish to fry. And it was[unintelligible]. I didn&#8482;t want to burn Mitchell unless-- I didn't want to burn Mitchell [unintelligible]. The key-106-to this thing, Ron, is Mitchell. Alwaysbeen the key [unintelligible] cover-up-- Dean did it [unintelligible] for Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Dean [unintelligible]himself. He did it for John Mitchell! Sodid Magruder do it for Mitchell. Magruder lied for Mitchell. You know that.ZIEGLER:Sure.PRESIDENT:And nothing before the twenty-seventh. Thatthey related to this, this, this, this, this, this, this and this. Not till thetwenty-first of March did he come in andtalk about a cover-up.ZIEGLER:And he did not in any way suggest that hewas involved directly. And--PRESIDENT:On the twenty-first he did. ZIEGLER:He did? PRESIDENT:He said, "Even Dean.&#64258; See, I re-- then,what I gave in these notes here, hesuggested that Dean might be called. Too, remember how he, where he said, "Because I've been over this like a blanket?"ZIEGLER:Yeah.PRESIDENT:But then I said, "But you had no knowledge.&#64258;It hit him hard. He said, "No, you--," Yousee, I was really trying to get him to Goddamn-107-PRESIDENT:That's the tragic [unintelligible].Mitchell would never step up to this. Well, I suppose, would you? No. No. Former Attorney General step up and say he bugged.Shit. I wouldn't. What I would step up andsay: "Look [unintelligible] damn thing and so forth but I gave responsibility for[unintelligible], uh, a suspended sentenceor a misdemeanor slapped in the face or whatever the hell [unintelligible].&#64258; But one denied it, under oath, uh-- he wasstuck! See-- God damn it!ZIEGLER:The perjury's the thing that is the problem PRESIDENT:Hm?ZIEGLER:The perjury's the thing that is the probleminvolved.PRESIDENT:There is now I guess. But you notice Deanadvanced Mitchell right in the last[unintelligible] Mitchell [unintelligible]Dean is guilty now.ZIEGLER:It'll be close. PRESIDENT:What? [Unintelligible] He subborned Magruderto perjury in Mitchell's presence! That'sthe, that's the major lie in this whole God damn thing, Ron.ZIEGLER:Dean knew, again.-108-PRESIDENT:Of course he knew. He knew all of this.ZIEGLER:Sure he did. PRESIDENT:He knew all of it. He didn't tell me-- youhear any of that in here?ZIEGLER:No sir.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] ZIEGLER:But the prosecutor's--PRESIDENT:But, but you see, in fairness to Dean, whenhe mentioned the fact that Strachan was involved, he mentioned the fact that, uh, that, uh, that it was not well to let it Call hang out, that Ehrlichman might have aproblem and so forth, he might well have drawn the conclusion, Ron, that thePresident wanted him to keep the lid on.ZIEGLER:Yeah. The political lid in the ErvinCommittee hearings, not the legal lid in terms of the trial.PRESIDENT:That's the difference. I see.ZIEGLER:That's the difference. That's theconclusion I had during this whole period. Yeah.PRESIDENT:Your talking about the Ervin Committee?-109-ZIEGLER:That's right.PRESIDENT:We're talking [unintelligible] about thetrial. The trial is over.ZIEGLER:We were concerned about the Ervin Committeeand what they would press for in terms notthat illegality, but in terms of political embarrassment. Uh, you know, of, uh, of,uh, uh, some of the, some--PRESIDENT:Well, in any event-- ZIEGLER:But the Justice Department-- PRESIDENT:Don't you think it's interesting though torun through this-- really, the God damnrecord is not bad, is it?ZIEGLER:There's no-- no [unintelligible]. Makes mefeel very good. Not that I--PRESIDENT:They've got [unintelligible] because I wassitting there like a dumb turkey. Not so much acting to some of these God damnthings, because--ZIEGLER:It's a [unintelligible] theory. PRESIDENT:Hm? ZIEGLER:It's a [unintelligible] theory. Five mensit in a room, and what occurs in that roomor what is said in that room means-110-something different to each man based on hisperception of events that preceded it. And that is exactly what this is exactly what it is.PRESIDENT:But I did say, Ron, now that you mention it,Magruder, Sloan pissing on each other, and I said the good thing to do is cut it off atthe pass. [Unintelligible] That's ErvinCommittee, I must admit.ZIEGLER:Just totally Ervin Committee. PRESIDENT:Well, Dean-- Suppose Dean goes out and saysso?ZIEGLER:Well, that's why I think we should let, letDean run his string, because he's saying somuch-- so much is being said for himPRESIDENT:Uh huh. ZIEGLER:that all is becoming so confused anddistorted. That's why we can't begin atthis point-- this is only my view--PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah. ZIEGLER:to respond clip by clip to everything that PRESIDENT:I couldn't agree more-111-ZIEGLER:[Unintelligible] says about you, becauseactually Dean has a, well, a tendency, coming out of all this very [unintelligible], very, you know--PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]ZIEGLER:And then he will have to be cracked, ordealt with in some way which we shoulddetermine down the line. Uh--PRESIDENT:Like what? What would be the other wayexcept for cracking?ZIEGLER:I think just right on a position.PRESIDENT:Not many options, you know.[Unintelligible]ZIEGLER:Yeah [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] lawyers [unintelligible]ZIEGLER:Yes sir. PRESIDENT:Clear based on this. ZIEGLER:Yes sir.PRESIDENT:We've got him dead right on that, Ron,haven't we?[Bull enters]PRESIDENT:What you got there?-112-BULL:The principle calls, sir. The ones made on-three calls made on March fourteenth that are relatively short ones.PRESIDENT:Yeah.BULL:Uh--PRESIDENT:Those are the first calls I made, uh? BULL:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Yeah. I didn't make any in February.ZIEGLER:It's March tenth [unintelligible] BULL:We don't have, we don't have a record ofMarch tenth, unfortunately sir. It's fromCamp David.PRESIDENT:Any from Camp David I don't have or KeyBiscayne.ZIEGLER:No, there were, there were no calls beforeMarch.PRESIDENT:There were none before March. I know that.I know that. I know that. I know that. Goahead.BULL:Uh, we have a call that Ziegler, that Ronplaced in your presence to, uh, to, uh, DeanPRESIDENT:I don't care about that.-113-BULL:and so, I-- it's noted on here. You've gotan extended callPRESIDENT:Yeah. BULL:on March sixteenth. I'm, I'm sorry anextended call an March sixteenth and arather extended conversation on March twentieth, that'll run you about twentyminutes, sir. In total a--PRESIDENT:Each was twenty? BULL:This final call, on March twentieth, that'sthe last one we have a record of, sir.PRESIDENT:All right.BULL:March twentieth. So what I have is about,oh, about close to forty minutes oftelephone calls or better.PRESIDENT:That's all you've got reported? BULL:That's all we have, sir. PRESIDENT:You don't have the calls that I made before?You're sure?BULL:Unfortunately not. We have no mechanism inFlorida, and no there is one at Camp David, but it's only on the phone in, in, uh, nextto your couch, down in-- I'm not familiarwith which phone it is.-114-PRESIDENT:Fine. Okay. That's good. Now, uh, thisworks the same as the others?BULL:Yes sir. It's right [unintelligible] It'sset for the first one now. Just[unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Fine BULL:triple digit really, you just assume thatit's a four digit setting in there[unintelligible]PRESIDENT:All right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Have themgive you something to eat out there.BULL:All right sir. [Unintelligible][Bull leaves]PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]ZIEGLER:We&#8482;re in the--PRESIDENT:You're not surprised in, uh-- you don't findanything in his files with regard to, uh, to records. My thought [unintelligible] todaywas that he probably took everything out.ZIEGLER:Well, I wouldn't think so, because, uh,'cause, uh, Fred was very shrewd in checking that. He went not only through his meetingswith you during this period, but he wentthrough-115-previous periods back at, uh, routine[unintelligible] involved in the [unintelligible]. And also his pattern of operating and there were no mem-con. Irecall, for example, there were-- the timethat we were going to bring that fellow from Virginia on board as Supreme Court Justice.He wouldn't have done themPRESIDENT:Powell? ZIEGLER:No, the, uh-- PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]ZIEGLER:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:If he would have done mem-cons, there wouldhave been a pattern in his file that wouldshow that. And he couldn't have taken outhis whole file if there's nothing there each day. [Clears throat] Not only of meetings with you, but just his normal pattern andhis files apparently, according to Fred--he's going to take another look at them-- are not organized in that way. And this was always my sense. He's just not that type ofa disciplined man.PRESIDENT:Maybe he's taken them all out and put themin one place other there? [Unintelligible]look carefully.ZIEGLER:Fred look pretty carefully.-116-PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible)ZIEGLER:He's going to go back at them again. But,uh, [unintelligible] Fred doesn't [unintelligible]. You know, his statementsup to this time have been [unintelligible].PRESIDENT:Right. What I was saying about this crap isthat it's reassuring up to a point, but infact, uh, at least, in this whole businesswe, we sat there and we conspired about a coverup [unintelligible] or not. We did talk about it on the twenty-first. That's atough conversation. Unless Haldeman[unintelligible]&#352;which he will. [Sighs] But I think we can survive that, too. Do you?ZIEGLER:Yeah, absolutely. We'll survive it all.PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] recollect what I thoughtthat we had to be facing a God damned traitor. Uh, I mean, why we could raise amillion dollars [unintelligible] but how thehell could you get it to him? It's wrong, that's the key thing. Haldeman remembers that. He's got--ZIEGLER:Sure he would say that.PRESIDENT:Hm?-117-ZIEGLER:You would not have, you would have notapproved of anything. [Unintelligible] Well, we've got the boys all squared up thinking about something else.PRESIDENT:What is that?ZIEGLER:Henry&#8482;s trip. They're all buzzing aroundone said they're going, you know -it'sdifferent concentration and ya know-- whichis good,PRESIDENT:Yeah. ZIEGLER:At least in that press room.PRESIDENT:Sure. Are they all obsessed with the Deanstory today?ZIEGLER:Yeah. Uh, no. That's-- they're funny.That's why this could be a great one. Theywent to the thing with Gerry. Then Gerry this afternoon booked through the Paris thing. And that's all they're talking about.Buzzing around and blowing it out ofproportion. But they are thinking about something else.

Good God this wholefabrication to the effect that we met in forty meetings, thirty five meetings aboutcoverup is bullshit!ZIEGLER:Absolutely. PRESIDENT:There ain't no meetings about coverup. ZIEGLER:The, uh-- Look, the fact of the matter is,is the first word through March-- I was justreviewing the news file-- Eastland was putting a great deal of pressure on us to have Dean go before the Committee. And wewere spending our time,-142-concerning ourselves as to how not toviolate the doctrine of separation of powers. That's what it was all about. It wasn't about coverup. It wasn't about[unintelligible]PRESIDENT:I wasn't trying to coverup anything. ZIEGLER:That's right.PRESIDENT:Neither was Dean, then.ZIEGLER:At some point, I have it in my notes, thetwenty-sixth of March,PRESIDENT:The twenty-sixth.ZIEGLER:twenty-sixth of March,PRESIDENT:Oh yeah that. ZIEGLER:I said to Dick Moore--PRESIDENT:The twenty-first you told me.ZIEGLER:No. No. Well, but-- rn DRESTRICTED-&#64257;D&#64258;PRESIDENT:What happened the twenty-fifth?-143-ZIEGLER:The twenty-sixth I said, Dick Moore did, uhand I have these in my office [unintelligible).

PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]ZIEGLER:On the twenty-sixth of March, and that waswhen-- You see, the first time that I began to be a little suspicious of Dean--PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible]ZIEGLER:no-- was at a point when the, when hereacted in a way-- when I was raising hell with him-- worried about the shield law andso forth, and, uh--PRESIDENT:What was the date on that? ZIEGLER:the first of March-- PRESIDENT:The first of March.ZIEGLER:and, uh, in a civil suit they, the lawyers,subpoenaed the files of a lot of newsmen and I said, "John, what in the hell are they doing in this, in the [unintelligible]."-144-And his response to me was erratic. Then aswe moved into, into the March, he, he was in a meeting or two in my office. And he was a little erratic. And I remember the day wewere sitting in here. I think it was aboutthe fourteenth of March, before the press conference.PRESIDENT:Yeah.ZIEGLER:And I was sitting in here and I had--because I knew the Ervin Committee [unintelligible]. And his responsiveness,and the way he was acting, in the back of mymind, I said, not that I was suspicious of him, but that I though this' guy who I hadput all this trust in all this time is notas competent as I thought he was.PRESIDENT:Competent. Right. ZIEGLER:There was a mystery [unintelligible]beginning to catch up.PRESIDENT:Took me longer. Took me to the twenty-firstwhen he came in and just bluntly said there-ZIEGLER:Well, I know-- Uh, we-- I didn't suspect,suspect him of any wrongdoing. I justthough-- began to suspect him of incompetence. Adn this is why I wasconvinced, when we talk&#352;-145-PRESIDENT:Ron, the important thing in this to rememberis always bullshit [unintelligible] to the effect that we met thirty-five times about coverup. It is totally false.ZIEGLER:That's right.PRESIDENT:Have we gotten that out? I don't suppose wehave.ZIEGLER:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:No way. Huh. Anybody backing[unintelligible]ZIEGLER:Scott, uh, is doing a little bit-- backed ussome.PRESIDENT:Uh huh [unintelligible] ZIEGLER:No. About this [unintelligible) get thesepeople along. Well, [unintelligible].PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] ZIEGLER:Funny thing about life is that most of thepeople [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Course they do. [Unintelligible) But don'tworry about it. We'll beat them.ZIEGLER:That's right. PRESIDENT:We're on the right side. That's the mainthing, you know.-146-ZIEGLER:This proves it today. This drill--PRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] proves it. I wondered whatthe hell was in that. You know, I thought maybe [unintelligible]--ZIEGLER:No, I never had any questions about the factthat-- absolutely no question--PRESIDENT:Buzhardt went through his whole God damnfiles and nothing there.ZIEGLER:What I was concerned about is that Dean hadthe [unintelligible] comment that [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:Well, there are a few, fewZIEGLER:[Unintelligible] PRESIDENT:Nothing we can't handle except March 21,which Haldeman can. Have handle that too.PRESIDENTor ZIEGLER:[Unintelligible/REMOVED]PRESIDENT:Be sure Moore knowsZIEGLER:Yes sirPRESIDENT:[Unintelligible] best recollections withregard to those-- have me come in [unintelligible]-147-ZIEGLER:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:No, the twentieth I've dictated just now.
