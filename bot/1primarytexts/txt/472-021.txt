PRESIDENT:I suggest that we sit over here everybody. Moreroom and, uh -- (coughing] Sit down.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah, thisUNIDENTIFIED:But UNIDENTIFIED:Oh, that's all right.UNIDENTIFIED:I had that Senator [unintelligible]UNIDENTIFIED:Came in and got me nervous, uh, he UNIDENTIFIED:If he'll go with you, well, that's great. UNIDENTIFIED:Very clever.UNIDENTIFIED:Phil, uh, [unintelligible]PRESIDENT:They're counting on Hubert. UNIDENTIFIED:Concentrate on Hubert. PRESIDENT:Hubert is supposed to have told Meany that I, uhSHULTZ:I don't know that you've met Don Rice, from theOffice of Management and Budget.PRESIDENT:Yes.-2-SHULTZ:Don Rice.[Several [Unintelligible]voices]RICE:How are you? SHULTZ:I talked with Meany this afternoon about the SST.PRESIDENT:What'd he say?SHULTZ:He said he was all out on it. If there wasanything we wanted him to do, he wanted to do it. He&#8482;d be ready to do it. They --PRESIDENT:Well, could you ask him to, could you ask him,could you phone him back after this meeting and ask him to call Hubert Humphrey, with the understanding he, uh--SHULTZ:Yeah. PRESIDENT:Hubert Humphrey has told everybody that he wasgoing to be for it. And he understood -- onlybecause Meany was for it.SHULTZ:That's right. PRESIDENT:Because Labor was for it. And, now that weunderstand he's wavering in it, he's breaking.And that Hubert Humphrey's vote may make thedifference.-3-SHULTZ:All right. I'll call him. He said he -- he hadbeen calling me and that he had quite a fewdisappointments, he said. But, anyway, I thinkwe're working on it and we will continue to work on it.PRESIDENT:And he, however, is apparently not doing much.SHULTZ:That's right. PRESIDENT:Uh, uh, uh, well, we ought to review this, thissituation with regard to milk. Now, uh, John,would you express your views, uh, to us all --you expressed them to me this morning. [Coughs] I had a [unintelligible] you fellows heard theirstory today.EHRLICHMAN:It's dead. it's-- CONNALLY:Well, Mr. President, I don't -- I understand youdid meet with 'em -- But I don't want to try togo back over the economics of it, uh, I'm not --PRESIDENT:How about the politics? Can you -- CONNALLY:Uh, I'm not trying to talk about it or discuss atany great length the, the economics of it, but asfar as the politics are concerned -- looking to1972, it, uh, it appears very clear to me that you're going to have to move, uh, strong in theMidwest. You're going to have to be strong-4-in rural America, uh, and particularly that partof the country. Now, there are a lot of thingsthat you can't do, uh, with respect to farmers.They're almost, uh, beyond help at this point. Uh, they feel like they are. They don't feellike anybody's trying to help them. Uh, everytime they turn around, they hear somebody talking about, wanting to increase imports on beef from Australia to, to -- in behalf of the consumer.Hog prices are down what, uh, fif--seventeendollars--HARDIN:(Unintelligible] dollars from twenty-nine.CONNALLY:They were, they were twenty-nine a year ago.HARDIN:It's because they grew so many. CONNALLY:Well, we had, there's, there's lots of problemsand they're responsible for a lot of them.Fortunately, beef prices have held up fairly wellbut, uh, grain is an insoluble problem so far as I can tell. Uh, it, it, it -- worrying with it for years, so I, I just don't know many areasthat you can do many things -- that's the net ofwhat I'm saying -- to help, uh, the farmers uh, and the dairy people now. These dairymen areorganized; they're adamant; they're-5-militant. This particular group, AMPI, which isthe American Milk Producers Institute or something, uh, represents about forty thousand peopleThe one that parallels them on the East, uh, Mid Con, or somethingHARDIN:Mid-American.CONNALLY:Mid-American group represents about fortythousand. The Southeastern group, uh, Dairymen Incorporated, whatever their name is, representsa lesser number, but probably in the range oftwenty thousand members. They, uh, very frankly, they tap these fellows--I believe it's one thirdof one percent of their total sales orninety-nine dollars a year whichever is--PRESIDENT:Like a union. CONNALLY:Oh, it's a check-off. No question about it. Andthey're meeting, and they're having meetings.They have them a Sabreliner airplane, and they just travel from one part of the country to another part of the country to get these fellowsin and they sign them up and it's a pure check-off deal. And they, they're amassing an enormous amount of money that they're going to put intopolitical activities, very frankly. And, uh, uh,-6-I think, in the first place--I think they've got,uh, a legitimate cause. I wouldn't, I wouldn'trecommend that you do, you ta--, anything thatdidn't have any merit to it. They're asking for, for an increase in the cost, uh, in the price ofa hundredweight up to four -- $4.92. Theyoriginally started out a $5.05. And, uh, uh, I am sure that these fellows can all argue more convincingly than I can that on the basis of themerits, they ought not to get it, or that milkproduction will go up or something else, but the truth of the matter is, the price of milk is nowpegged at $4.92. You're not going to raise theprice of milk. Uh, they're supporting the price of milk themselves with their own money by buying cheese. Right today. Now, if they, if you don'tsupport the price, if Cliff doesn't support it at$4.92, they're going to have to drop it because their, their resources are not such that, that they can continue to pay the difference between,what, $4.66 and the, and the $4.92. So they'lldrop the price.HARDIN:Now they're, they're in trouble. They've alreadyspent more money than they have, and-7-they're going to drop the price of milk aboutfifty cents a hundred, on, uh, April one.[Unintelligible] lost to the Treasury. This iswhy they're desperate --UNIDENTIFIED:They're not, they aren't simply involved with lowresources.CONNALLY:They, they may well have. Now, there's some talkthat, uh, that if the management of it's in trouble and so forth -- I don't believe it, Idon't believe it.UNIDENTIFIED:I'll, I'll-- CONNALLY:They just raised and paid twenty thousand dollarsfor a meeting in Brownsville not too long ago.And this means they've got security. And, uh, they're doing some things that I think are a little strong-armed tactics, perhaps, in, uh, theorganizing, uh. But, uh, I don't criticize thatunless we are prepared to take on business and labor and all at the same time. There's no point in denying the farmer what's the practice forlabor. And, uh, so I'm not, I wouldn't judge iton a moral basis. I judge it on the basis of, uh--HARDIN:You've heard all the rest of it---8-CONNALLY:I'm addressing myself to the narrow aspects, tothe political aspects of it. I don't thinkthere's a better organization in the UnitedStates. If you can get it, uh, you can got more help from, that, uh, will be, uh, be more loyalto you. And, uh, and I think they've got aworthy case to begin with. And, uh, that being true, I just think you ought to stretch the point. I wouldn't wait till next year, so that-- I know that there's been some advice given toyou, to wait till next year. Uh, that's -- I will differ with that, simply because they'regoing to make their association and theiralliances this year and they're going to spend a lot of money this year in various Congressional and Senatorial races all over this United States.And, you don't want to be in a position -- as youwell know better than I -- you got no questions when people think they forced you into doing something for them. And they're not now in thatposition. If, if you do something for them thisyear, they think you've done it because they got a good case and because you're their friend. Ifyou wait till next year, I don't care what you dofor them. They're going to say, "Well; we put enough pressure on them this election year, they had-9-to do it.&#64258; And you, you get no credit for it.So it's still going to cost you an enormousamount of money next year, and you get nopolitical advantage out of it. And, I just think that, uh, that unless you just, uh -- theeconomics of it are just beyond reach, or beyondquestion that, uh, if you ought to really seriously think about doing it this year.PRESIDENT:That's the problem. I have two problems -- isthat you have it in the House and the Senate.CONNALLY:What you are going to do on that? UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:What I mean is, that if you don't do it, they'regoing to do it anyway.CONNALLY:I think if you don't do it PRESIDENT:If they do,--CONNALLY:they're going to pass it.PRESIDENT:I think they do. HARDIN:I think it's-- PRESIDENT:We have a damn near insoluble problem.HARDIN:I think it's, as it stands today, it's almostcertain to pass.CONNALLY:Uh, I think that's right.EHRLICHMAN:Is that what Belcher told you?-10-HARDIN:Yes, yes, I think they got a hundred and fiftynames on the bill.UNIDENTIFIED:You sure?HARDIN:And, uh, UNIDENTIFIED:What is it?HARDIN:and, uh, the Speaker's all out for it.CONNALLY:Absolutely. Wilbur's all out for it. UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah. CONNALLY:Well, they're going to pass it through the House.Beyond any question in the world.HARDIN:And, uh, and, uh, they'll pull the liberals onthis one, uh, because they're, they'll saythey're going to embarrass the President.PRESIDENT:That's right. HARDIN:Uh, the liberals might attract the consumers inany other situation. But they won't do it now.PRESIDENT:That'll raise the price, you see. I mean, that'sthe way they'll cut the liberals off. They'll say: No, they're going to -- we guarantee, we won't like they told us this morning, we won'traise the price; we'll cut back on productionwe'll have a voluntary--HARDIN:Uh, I spoke, I spoke a little bit with them thismorning, uh, but I just don't quite know---11-UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]CONNALLY:Now they've already figured out and how--They'recirculating -- I've had it for days they'recirculating how they're going to cut you up this year. And that's what they're going to do. Theygot it all figured out. They're passing this outon the Hill, just exactly how many electoral votes they're going to cost you if you veto the 85% bill -- which they think they're going topass. And I think they're going to pass it. Andthey say that it'll cost you Missouri, Wisconsin, South Dakota for sure. Veto will probably costyou Ohio, Kentucky and Iowa. And, then they goon down and they take the states and they figure what percentage of the states it's going to cost you and they're going to [unintelligible]HARDIN:Well, if it does pass, I don't think thePresident has any choice but to sign it.PRESIDENT:Well, all right. CONNALLY:Well, then, what do you do? If you do, you'vecost yourself the money -- you've lost yourpolitical advantage. You, you're, you're infinitely worse off.-12-PRESIDENT:Probably.CONNALLY:That's where you are.HARDIN:I think so.PRESIDENT:What's the cost? HARDIN:Oh, it's just a wild guess. They said thirtyfive million and I would suggest that it's, uh,nearer a hundred.PRESIDENT:You would? HARDIN:Now if they could get, if they need to -- we hada little talk after you left andUNIDENTIFIED:Right. HARDIN:uh, about whether they really could influenceproduction. And they could, if they went all outto do it. And what they would do, a year from now, would be end up with a hundred and twenty million -- billion pounds of milk produced. Uh,they'd be a mature enough organization that theycould, uh, recognize that they had made a mistake and could go out and tell their members they had to survive. Uh, well, they're -- maybe we won'ttalk about that. Uh, it's a fact of life. Uh--PRESIDENT:Uh, it seems to me that the problem we have,Cliff, is this. That, uh and as you know we havedecided on a different course of action in thecheese business and all the other ---13-HARDIN:Well that has to be done. That has, has to bedone anyhow.PRESIDENT:Oh, what I mean isn't that what we decided that,and that was all we could do.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.SHULTZ:The higher you raise the price, the more certainit is that you have to be strict about the imports. otherwise, all we're doing is paying the money to the foreigners.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.SHULTZ:You have to make a judgment on the importbusinessUNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Uh, I see your-- SHULTZ:See that high price here throughout the PRESIDENT:Uh, uh&#352;(Several [Unintelligible]voices] UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah. Uh. UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]PRESIDENT:like high interest rates.UNIDENTIFIED:That's right. UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible), Yeah.-14-PRESIDENT:Well, it's one of those things where with all youexperts sitting around where you have to make apolitical judgment. My political judgment isthat the Congress is going to pass it. I could not veto it. Not because they're milk producers,but because they're farmers. And it would bejust turning down the whole damn middle America. Uh, where, uh, we, uh, where we, uh, need support. And under the circumstances, I thinkthe best thing to do is to just, uh, relax andenjoy it.UNIDENTIFIED:The legal--CONNALLY:Mr. President, trade for both years, if you doit. Trade for this year and next year, if you possibly can.PRESIDENT:With these people?CONNALLY:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:Well, CONNALLY:Yes, sir. PRESIDENT:can that be done? I, uh, that's what I, uh--CONNALLY:Yes, sir.PRESIDENT:That would be great. CONNALLY:Yes, sir.EHRLICHMAN:If you could make a deal for the two years--CONNALLY:Yes, sir. It can be done. HARDIN:They will do that.-15-UNIDENTIFIED:You bet.CONNALLY:Won't they Phil?CAMPBELL:Yes.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah, I would-- UNIDENTIFIED:Well, I would say the price is stable.PRESIDENT:Yes, that's correct.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah. HARDIN:The other thing Mr. President, so they're notaskingUNIDENTIFIED:And, uhHARDIN:that, uh, on grounds that it would be just hardto answer. These fellows have a tendency to say,"Well, now look, uh, look at the constructionindustry. Look at Labor. Uh, and then why be so chintzy with us? Uh, all, all evidence is our costs keep rising, and that we're under thefreeze, and, uh, you take it out on us not, notthe people who are really causing the problem.&#64258; And, this is hard to answer, uh, when it's a challenge put that way--CAMPBELL:Well I think we can settle for a--UNIDENTIFIED:We've got this other consid- PRESIDENT:All right, make the best deal you can.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.PRESIDENT:Do it for two years and, uh, we, uh, we, uh, weknow that, uh, and as I say, I appreciate the,-16-the very fine judgment to the contrary which,which you can't do as, uh--HARDIN:Now, we must do one other thing, uhUNIDENTIFIED:(Unintelligible] PRESIDENT:Let's let them know what we're doing. That, uhEHRLICHMAN:Let's get credit.UNIDENTIFIED:Oh, God, if we're going to do this CONNALLY:Mr. President -- PRESIDENT:Let'sCONNALLY:Please, may I interject a suggestion?PRESIDENT:Uh, uh-- UNIDENTIFIED:[Sighs)CONNALLY:Uh--PRESIDENT:Anything you like. CONNALLY:Well, let's don't, let's don't trade the, uh, uh,through Agriculture, uh, on the meritsPRESIDENT:Yeah.CONNALLY:until, uh, some other conversations are hid. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah.

[Unintelligible]UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible] UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.EHRLICHMAN:Now you could hold your position, now till youget the green light, couldn't you?CONNALLY:Oh, sure. PRESIDENT:What?EHRLICHMAN:Yeah, as I say, then Agriculture doesn't need todo anything right away.UNIDENTIFIED:He--PRESIDENT:You, you're now thinking of the political offer?EHRLICHMAN:In a day or so. (Several voices)[Unintelligible] SHULTZ:The sooner you do it, the better off you're goingto be, aren't you?HARDIN:Uh, yeah. Possibly, uhPage, SHULTZ:In a day or so. HARDIN:now, Page knows Dole. I wish he hadn't done itquite this way, but one of his little talks tothe Speaker, and Wilbur -- He got them to agree to hold the bill until he could talk to the WhiteHouse.-18-PRESIPENT:Well--CONNALLY:He, he could make, Mr. President, I suggest toyou that somebody could make a little capitalWith the Speaker and with Wilbur. Now if you'll do this. Now somebody can do it. Now, they'll,they'll say, well, you, you know, they'll say,well, "You did it becausePRESIDENT:Yeah. CONNALLY:we've introduced a bill.PRESIDENT:All right.CONNALLY:But I know somebody down here can make a littletime with them. How much, how much I don't know.But it's worth trying, obviously, because they'reboth extremely interested in it.EHRLICHMAN:Phil, move over there, would you. We'd like toget the picture of some of the House groups thatare interested in the topic (intelligible). Alltogether now.HARDIN:Wilbur, uh-- UNIDENTIFIED:Shouldn't happen [unintelligible)SHULTZ:As an aside on this: Wilbur passed the message tome via Bill Gifford to thank you very much. Apparently his family was---19-UNIDETIFIED:Yeah, he got around to the White House.SHULTZ:And, uh, he spoke with -- and the grand and hesaid the grandchildren loved it. Wilbur saysit's the nicest thing that's happened to him in years.PRESIDENT:Hah.SHULTZ:And I just wanted you to know [unintelligible] heapprecia--, he really had a very pleasant evening.CONNALLY:Let me tell you how important I think it is toWilbur. Now I don't -- I can't vouch for this. I haven't pursued it. I haven't followed it up.I don't want to. But, I was told that you couldalmost name your price with Wilbur short of all-out support of revenue sharing if you did it.EHRLICHMAN:You know him?CONNALLY:Yes, sir.CAMPBELL:You that close to him? CONNALLY:That's correct. CAMPBELL:And he knows this bill intimately.CONNALLY:That's correct.CAMPBELL:And he can explain it to you better than thedairymen.-20-CONNALLY:That's correct.PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah.CONNALLY:he sure can.PRESIDENT:I noticed they had a strong man from Arkansas inthere, didn't they?EHRLICHRAN:Well, uh, let me ask this. Uh, who's the guythat told? Uh--PRESIDENT:What my point is: This is something where I wouldnot have it done by you, Cliff, in Agriculture.Let's have it done in a way by somebody who hasto get something out of it. Uh, like George. You see my point?HARDIN:Uh hm. Sure.PRESIDENT:On Wilbur. HARM:Sure. PRE5IDENT:How would that be? Does that sound all right toyou, John? Or should you tell him?CONNALLY:No. I think somebody other than me, sir. PRESIDENT:Yeah. CONNALLY:I think George, orPRESIDENT:Yeah.CONNALLY:whoever-- PRESIDENT:You see my point?SHULTI:Yeah, maybe John and I.-21-PRESIDENT:Maybe John Ehrlichman and George.CONNALLY:And don't overlook the Speaker, Mr. President.PRESIDENT:And do the same with the Speaker. But, I meanthe point is, when you do something for these fellows, remember, don't just let them think thatwe're doing it for, uh, turning our back onpolicy. Get a picture to them.UNIDENTIFIED:True. Right. UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible)PRESIDENT:You have that point, now.UNIDENTIFIED:Yes, sir. PRESIDENT:Fine.CONNALLY:I could maybe suggest a better way. If you tieit in uh, keep in mind that Wilbur called me twice about this.PRESIDENT:Uh huh.CONNALLY:And I think Jerry called him about this.HARDIN:Did he call you about it? CONNALLY:The Speaker called me, which is very unusual, andhe just normally doesn't do that.UNIPENTIFIED:Well, that's fine Dick, both talked to you aboutit.PRESIDENT:All right. Fine. Well, all right.EHRLICHMAN:There is---22-PRESIDENT:I think that, I think that, I think what our ployshould be here is basically, uh, uh, I thinkmaybe it's, uh, George and John -- What do youthink? John Ehrlichman.EHRLICHMAN:I think that would be great.PRESIDENT:They, they're going to have to deal with them onrevenue sharing and all these other programs.

Uh, youknow, uh, uh, we've got to accommodate -- I thinkwe ought to go this week.PRESIDENT:Good, I think the sooner the better, HARDIN:And, uh --PRESIDENT:because, uh, let's don't have, let's don't do itunder pressure.HARDIN:And, uh, uh, uh, I think that if you can getWilbur and, uh, uh, the Speaker quickly,UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah. HARDIN:uh, then, uh, uh, you get a hold of Page andthese other fellows, uh, also, but, as soon asthey know what we are thinking about, uh, it willleak out pretty fast.SHULTZ:Well, I don't think that there's any problemsabout the thing and, uh --PRESIDENT:But be sure you get to Page Belcher.UNIDENTIFIED:(Unintelligible) PRESIDENT:He could get Wilbur.-24-UNIDENTIFIED:But you're going to have to [unintelligible]UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]SHULTZ:If you wanted to, you could do it. At the sametime, of course, you get different people doingit so they don't get crossed up.UNIDENTIFIED: All right. CAMPBELL:It, it, it -- it's going to have to almost bedone simultaneously because just as soon asthey've talked, it's so important, everybody isgoing to know it. The first one that knows is going to get on the phone and call the dairymen,UNIDENTIFIED:You, uh --CAMPBELL:and soon as one of the dairymen knows, all ofthem will.PRESIDENT:I'll say.SHULTZ:Uh, but aren't you and somebody going to want totalk to the dairymen about it so you can set up aEHRLICHMAN:Make a two year deal. UNIDENTIFIED:A two year deal.SHULTZ:two year deal.-25-PRESIDENT:I think first you have got to--Well, then andthey're going to know - They're, they're--CAMPBELL:But no, Mr. President, you could ask, you couldask if we're able to do anything would you be satisfied to leave this alone next year. They'llcome back promptly -- and you'll got a way out ifyou do. They'll never, never listen to the Secretary. We've found that --UNIDENTIFIED:Um huh.CAMPBELL:But I can tell you--UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible] UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]CONNALLY:May I suggest?UNIANTIFIED:And I know -- CAMPBELL:I suggest just as quick I can get them on thetelephone.PRESIDENT:All right.CONNALLY:May I also suggest -- PRESIDENT:Make sure you got the deal to present to me.And, uh --UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible]CAMPBELL:No. I'm not notifying them anyway.-26-PRESIDENT:No, no, no, no, no. [Unintelligible]EHRLICHMAN:His idea is that he'll say, "Look we were able todo this. Will you pledge this.&#64258; See?PRESIDENT:Uh huh. CAMPBELL:No, no problem.EHRLICHMAN:Still hypothetical.PRESIDENT:Yeah, yeah. Then that way the decision is stillopen. And then, boom.CONNALLY:And you can pretty well seal this, John andGeorge, uh, when you talk to Wilbur and theSpeaker. The two year aspect.UNIDENTIFIED:You handle it.CONNALLY:You should hear that out and we'll talk about it.WHITAKER:I just want to raise one point. The thing thatgot that started is the concern of over production. If you don't think down the linewith me it will be more trouble in the end.CAMPBELL:This -- if, if we do it'll be two years off andnot next year.UNIDENTIFIED:That's it.PRESIDENT:And John, what other problems does that involve?Uh, uh [unintelligible][Severalvoices][Unintelligible]-27-HARDIN:[Unintelligible) you may have over-productionnext year. And we may blame it on this. But itwill be for other reasons.PRESIDENT:Yeah. EHRLICHMAN:Actually it takes more -takes longer than that.PRESIDENT:There's one thing about this, it's one thingabout this industry that is, uh, quite interesting. It's that, uh, it's, uh, it's a big business. From the standpoint -- you know, theygo into this business, you know, and people say-- It -- As a matter of fact, I get the impression, Cliff, and I'm not too much of anexpert on the farmer, but I get the impressionthatFor example, with regard, uh, uh, regarding, regarding the price of hogs. People who go into that business, from what I gather -- it's prettyeasy, isn't it?HARDIN:Changing the par--when compared PRESIDENT:The dairy business, on the other hand, requiresan enormous net invest--, investment. You know,you can raise more pigs, right?HARDIN:Yes. And the, and the times get---28-PRESIDENT:Fast. Fast. And that's why the pig, po-- thecorn-hog ratio uh -- that business goes up anddown almost like an escalator, doesn't it?UNIDENTIFIED:Right. CONNALLY:Mr. President, two litters per year and theaverage now is running better than seven pigs perlitter, isn't it?CAMPBELL:Mr. President, there has been some studies run onthis and the cost is approximately, it approachestwo thousand dollars per cow. So you justmultiply fifty cows, a hundred cows, a hundred-fifty cows by two, two thousand dollars.You've got a pretty good investment.PRESIDENT:Well, you have an enormous-- so somebody is goingto go into that business.UNIDENTIFIED:Yeah.PRESIDENT:I mean, uh, there are added things; it's, it's abig, uh--CAMPBELL:Big chunk of cash. Can't go less than fiftycows,PRESIDENT:I know. Yeah.CAMPBELL:seventy or eighty. PRESIDENT:Yeah. Yeah.-29-HARDIN:But, uh, we had, what, a million dairy farmers,uh, ten years ago and down four hundred thousandfrom what you were.SHULTZ:We have a, uh, we have a problem to, to, uh,think about here on the antitrust side of thisthing, uh, they're going to wind up in trouble.HARDIN:Yes, they may have-- SHULTZ:If they try to control production, HARDIN:Yeah, they, theySHULTZ:they're over -- they're, very eager.UNIDENTIFIED:[Unintelligible] HARDIN:may have already done it. But, uh, ut--CONNALLY:The significant thing is they have legal Counseland they&#8482;re following their advice.HARDIN:Well-- PRESTDENT:Good.SHULTZ:They do hive a good legal counsel.EHRLICHMAN:They have a good one. PRESIDENT:They've got them all over the country. CONNALLY:Uh, there are many folks (unintelligible] but Idon't know Cliff what you're talking about.-30-HARDIN:Uh, well, they're, they're sure, they're sureawfully close to the line. They are not thefirst group in the economy, that's done that.UNIDENTIFIED:Oh, I'll say. [Laughing) PRESIDENT:Well, we won't prosecute the farmers.HARDIN:Could I bring up just one other thing?PRESIDENT:Sure. HARDIN:It's a somewhat related subject, Mr. President. PRESIDENT:Sure.HARDIN:It doesn't have anything to do with this matter;but, uh,--PRESIDENT:Britain?HARDIN:No.PRESIDENT:No. HARDIN:Uh? Meat, meat imports. Uh-- PRESIDENT:Oh, that. I thought we decided that.HARDIN:We did.PRESIDENT:We are going to import aren't we? HARDIN:Uh, a little, uh, as little as possible. But Mr.Houthaker called me yester--He's convening ameeting now, and, uh, he thinks we ought to forcethe price of beef down. And let in more imports. And he's, he wants a inter-departmental meeting Ithink it's next Tue--Monday or Tuesday. And thisis just-31-going to, uh, raise havoc with the cattlemen allover again. When we just got them all quieteddown. They've all written articles; they're justbleeding about what the President did.PRESIDENT:What would I do, if, if -- and didn't importednot too much, and meanwhile hold that middle,middle options?HARDIN:Yes. And, uh, they're, and uh, so I called Edand I said, "Now, I want to see you bleed in yourpublications. I want you to post all the -- andsupport the President." He went all out with me on this. "Well," he said "we [unintelligible]just a little.&#64258; And I said, "If I see one word[unintelligible] not one damned one of you is ever going to get in my office again.
